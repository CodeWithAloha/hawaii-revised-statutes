involved without the intervention of a jury.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  All claims against the State founded upon any
statute of the State; or upon any regulation of an executive department; or
upon any contract, expressed or implied, with the State, and all claims which
may be referred to any such court by the legislature; provided that no action
shall be maintained, nor shall any process issue against the State, based on
any contract or any act of any state officer which the officer is not
authorized to make or do by the laws of the State, nor upon any other cause of
action than as herein set forth.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  All counterclaims, whether liquidated or
unliquidated, or other demands whatsoever on the part of the State against any
person making claim against the State under this chapter. [L 1894-5, c 26, §1;

<p class=XNotes>  An order denying a pretrial motion based on sovereign
immunity is not a final judgment, therefore, not appealable.  71 H. 519, 795
P.2d 283.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Further waiver of sovereign immunity not necessary for
§607-14 to apply to the State and its agencies in matters in which, by virtue
of the express waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in this section, the
State has become a party.  87 H. 37, 951 P.2d 487.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insofar as the State has not expressly and statutorily waived
its sovereign immunity from postjudgment interest in suits brought pursuant to
this section, the State is immune from awards of §478-3 postjudgment interest
in actions under this section; thus, the trial court erred in ordering that the
employees' retirement system pay statutory interest at the rate of ten per cent
per annum, pursuant to §478-3.  106 H. 416, 106 P.3d 339.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where ocean recreation management area permit at issue was a
revocable license rather than a contract, this section was not a basis for
subject matter jurisdiction.  113 H. 184, 150 P.3d 833.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where §343-7 waived the State's sovereign immunity against
actions brought to challenge: (1) the lack of an environmental assessment; (2)
the determination that an environmental impact statement is or is not required;
and (3) the acceptance of an environmental impact statement, sovereign immunity
did not prevent the application of the private attorney general doctrine
against the State and the circuit court did not err in relying on the doctrine
as a basis for its award of attorney's fees against the State and Superferry
jointly.  120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the doctrine of primary jurisdiction applies to claims
against the employees' retirement system arising out of alleged miscalculation
of retirement contribution and benefits, while the circuit court had original
jurisdiction over the claim, the court did not abuse its discretion in staying,
rather than dismissing, the class action pending administrative review of
plaintiffs' individual claims.  121 H. 462 (App.), 220 P.3d 1043.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  While the accrual and extent of an employee's benefits are
governed by the applicable statutory provisions of chapter 88, the duty of the
employees' retirement system to pay accrued benefits is deemed to be
contractual under article XVI, §2 of the Hawaii constitution; thus, a circuit
court's jurisdiction under paragraph (1) over such claims is &quot;founded upon
contract&quot;, as well as statute and the circuit court did not err in
rejecting defendant's contention that plaintiffs' claims were barred by
sovereign immunity.  121 H. 462 (App.), 220 P.3d 1043.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As this section contains a limited waiver of sovereign
immunity for claims against the State that are founded upon a statute or
founded upon a contract with the State, the circuit court did not err when it
allowed plaintiff substitute teachers to pursue breach-of-contract claims
against the State where the teachers were in a contractual relationship with
the State, sought money that they claimed were due them for the work they performed
under the contract, and alleged that under the express and implied terms of
their agreement, they were entitled to pay in accordance with §302A-624(e). 
122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The State's sovereign immunity from plaintiff substitute
teachers' claims against the State was waived under this section and
§302A-624(e) where §302A-624(e) stated that the per diem salary for substitute
teachers &quot;shall be&quot; based on the formula that it described, and
§302A-624(e), as a pay-mandating statute, provided an alternative basis for
invoking the court's jurisdiction under the &quot;founded upon any
statute&quot; language in this section.  122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Does not confer jurisdiction on insurer actions to recover
moneys paid to the State without protest under §431-318.  5 H. App. 122, 678
P.2d 1101.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Suit authorized as one based on implied contract of warranty
of authority.  5 H. App. 616, 705 P.2d 72.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Suit to recover public assistance benefits wrongfully denied
is a claim against State founded upon any statute.  6 H. App. 160, 715 P.2d
813.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Decisions under prior law.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Suit against government under old laws.  1 H. 266; 7 H. 715. 
Actions for tort under 1888 statute.  8 H. 546; 9 H. 101.  Effect of 1895
statute, prior to enactment of chapter 662.  13 H. 1, 3; 13 H. 478, 479.</p>
