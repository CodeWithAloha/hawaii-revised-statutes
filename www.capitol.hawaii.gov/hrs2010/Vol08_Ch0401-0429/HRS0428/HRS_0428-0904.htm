jurisdiction, or any combination thereof, with one of the domestic professional
corporations, domestic or foreign limited liability companies, or other
business entities whether domestic or foreign, being the surviving entity as
provided in the plan; provided that the merger is permitted by the law of the
state or country under whose law each foreign entity that is a party to the
merger is organized.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The plan of merger shall set forth:</p>

principal place of business, or if no street address is available, the rural
post office number or post office box designated or made available by the
United States Postal Service; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Amendments, if any, to the organizing articles of
the surviving entity or, if no amendments are desired, a statement that the
organizing articles of the surviving entity shall not be amended pursuant to
the merger.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A plan of merger may:</p>

<p class=1Paragraphunderscored style='line-height:normal'><span
style='text-decoration:none'>     (1)  Amend the operating agreement of a
limited liability company; or</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraphunderscored style='line-height:normal'><span
style='text-decoration:none'>     (2)  Adopt a new operating agreement for a

merger.  This subsection shall not limit the accomplishment of a merger or of
any of the matters referred to in this subsection by any other means provided
for in a limited liability company agreement or other agreement or as otherwise
permitted by law; provided that the limited liability company agreement of any

limited liability company.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A plan of merger may set forth other
provisions relating to the merger.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A plan of merger shall be approved:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  In the case of a limited liability company that
is a party to the merger, unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement,
by the members representing the percentage of ownership specified in the
operating agreement, but not fewer than the members holding a majority of the
ownership, or if provision is not made in the operating agreement, by all the
members; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  In the case of a foreign limited liability
company that is a party to the merger, by the vote required for approval of a
merger by the law of the state or foreign jurisdiction in which the foreign
limited liability company is organized.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  If a foreign limited liability company is
the surviving entity of a merger, it shall not do business in this State until
an application for a certificate of authority is filed with the director if the
foreign limited liability company is not already authorized to do business in
the State. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The surviving entity shall furnish a copy

liability company notwithstanding approval by all or any of the constituent
parties.  If the plan of merger is terminated after the filing of the articles
but before the plan has become effective, a certificate of termination shall be
filed with the director.  A plan of merger may allow the members or managers of
the constituent limited liability companies to amend the plan at any time prior
to the time that the plan becomes effective; provided that an amendment made
subsequent to the adoption of the plan by the members or managers of any
constituent limited liability company shall not:</span></p>

of merger is amended after the articles are filed with the director but before
the plan has become effective, a certificate of amendment shall be filed with
