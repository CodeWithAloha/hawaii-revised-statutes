<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:4A-302  Obligations of receiving bank
in execution of payment order.</b>  (a)  Except as provided in subsections (b)
through (d), if the receiving bank accepts a payment order pursuant to section
490:4A-209(a), the bank has the following obligations in executing the order:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the
execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow
the sender's instructions concerning (i) any intermediary bank or
funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer, or (ii)
the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer. 
If the originator's bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the
originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the
instruction of the originator.  An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is
similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment
order it accepts.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  If the sender's instruction states that the funds
transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise
indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious
means, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most
expeditious available means, and to instruct any intermediary bank
accordingly.  If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving
bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably
necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon
thereafter as is feasible.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving
bank executing a payment order may (i) use any funds-transfer system if use of
that system is reasonable in the circumstances, and (ii) issue a payment order
to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment
order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the
beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the
selection of the intermediary bank.  A receiving bank is not required to follow
an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in
carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith,
determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following
the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Unless subsection (a)(2) applies or the
receiving bank is otherwise instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by
transmitting its payment order by first class mail or by any means reasonable
in the circumstances.  If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the
sender's order by transmitting its payment order by a particular means, the
receiving bank may issue its payment order by the means stated or by any means as
expeditious as the means stated.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Unless instructed by the sender, (i) the
receiving bank may not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses
in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment
order in an amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of
the charges, and (ii) may not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain
payment of its charges in the same manner. [L 1991, c 41, pt of §1]</p>
