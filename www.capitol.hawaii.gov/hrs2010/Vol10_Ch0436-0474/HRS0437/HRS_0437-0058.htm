<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§437-58]  Cancellation or failure to renew
franchise agreement.  </b>(a)  A manufacturer or distributor shall give written
notice to the dealer and the board of the manufacturer's intent to terminate,
discontinue, cancel, or fail to renew a franchise agreement at least sixty days
before the effective date thereof, and state with specificity the grounds being
relied upon for such discontinuation, cancellation, termination, or failure to
renew; provided that the manufacturer or distributor may provide the notice
fifteen days before the effective date of termination, discontinuation,
cancellation, or non-renewal in the following circumstances:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The dealer has filed a voluntary petition in
bankruptcy or has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it
which has not been discharged within thirty days after the filing, there has
been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the dealer's assets related to
the business, or there has been a commencement of dissolution or liquidation of
the dealer;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The dealer has failed to operate in the normal
course of business for seven consecutive days or has otherwise abandoned the
business;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The dealer has pleaded guilty to or has been
convicted of a felony affecting the relationship between the dealer and the
manufacturer or distributor;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The dealer has engaged in conduct that is
injurious or detrimental to the dealer's customers or to the public welfare;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  There has been a change, without the prior
written approval of the manufacturer or distributor, in the location of the
dealer's principal place of business under the dealership agreement; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Misrepresentation or fraud upon the manufacturer
by the dealer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A dealer who receives notice of intent to
terminate, discontinue, cancel, or fail to renew may, within the sixty-day
notice period, file a petition in the manner prescribed in section 437-51 for a
determination of whether such action is taken in good faith and supported by
good cause.  The manufacturer or distributor shall have the burden of proof
that such action is taken in good faith and supported by good cause.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the manufacturer's or distributor's
notice of intent to terminate, discontinue, cancel, or fail to renew is based
upon the dealer's alleged failure to comply with sales or service performance
obligations, the dealer shall first be provided with notice of the alleged
sales or service deficiencies and afforded at least one hundred eighty days to
correct any alleged failure before the manufacturer or distributor may send its
notice of intent to terminate, discontinue, cancel, or fail to renew.  Good
cause shall not be deemed to exist if a dealer substantially complies with the
manufacturer's or distributor's reasonable performance provisions within the
one hundred eighty-day cure period, or if the failure to demonstrate
substantial compliance was due to factors that were beyond the control of the
dealer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Good cause shall not exist absent a breach
of a material and substantial term of the franchise agreement.  The existence
of one or more circumstances enumerated in subsection (a)(1) through (6) above
shall be presumed to be good cause, and the dealer shall have the burden of
proof to show that the action was not taken in good faith and supported by good
cause.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Except in the circumstances enumerated in
subsection (a)(1) through (6) above, the franchise agreement shall remain in
effect until a final judgment is entered after all appeals are exhausted, and
during that time the dealer shall retain all rights and remedies pursuant to
the franchise agreement, including the right to sell or transfer the franchise.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Upon the termination, discontinuation,
cancellation, or failure to renew the franchise agreement by the manufacturer
or distributor, the manufacturer or distributor shall compensate the dealer for
all new, unused, and undamaged parts listed in the current parts catalog and
still in the original, resalable merchandising packages and in unbroken lots;
provided that for sheet metal, a comparable substitute may be used.  Prices
shall be those in effect at the time the manufacturer or distributor receives
the parts, less applicable allowances; the fair market value of all undamaged,
unmodified special tools, equipment, and signage required by the manufacturer or
distributor and acquired by the dealer within the three years prior to the
termination; all new, undamaged, and unsold vehicle inventory of the current
model year and one model year prior acquired from the manufacturer or
distributor or from another same line make dealer in the ordinary course of
business prior to the effective date of termination or non-renewal; provided
that the vehicle has less than five hundred miles registered on the odometer. 
The purchase price shall be the dealer's net acquisition cost.  The
compensation shall be paid to the dealer no later than ninety days from the
date of the franchise termination, discontinuation, cancellation, or failure to
renew.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  In addition to the other compensation set
forth in this section, upon the termination, discontinuation, cancellation, or
failure to renew the franchise agreement by a manufacturer or distributor
without good cause and good faith; or as a result of the discontinuation of a
line make, the manufacturer or distributor shall compensate the dealer at the
fair market value for the dealer's capital investment, which shall include the
going business value of the business, goodwill, property, and improvement owned
or leased by the dealer for the purpose of the franchise as of the effective date
of the termination or one day prior to the date of the notice, whichever is
greater.  The compensation shall be paid to the dealer no later than ninety
days from the date of the franchise termination, discontinuation, cancellation,
or failure to renew.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  As used in this section, &quot;good
faith&quot; means the duty of each party to any franchise agreement to fully
comply with that agreement, and to act in a fair and equitable manner towards
each other. [L 2010, c 164, pt of §2]</p>
