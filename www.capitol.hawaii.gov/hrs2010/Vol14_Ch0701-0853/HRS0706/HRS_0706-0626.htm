<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§706-626  Summons or arrest of defendant on
probation; commitment without bail.</b>  At any time before the discharge of
the defendant or the termination of the period of probation:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The court may, in connection with the probation,
summon the defendant to appear before it or may issue a warrant for the
defendant's arrest;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A probation or law enforcement officer, having
probable cause to believe that the defendant has failed to comply with a
requirement imposed as a condition of the order, may arrest the defendant
without a warrant and the defendant shall be held in custody pending the
posting of bail pursuant to a bail schedule established by the court, or until
a hearing date is set; provided that when the punishment for the original
offense does not exceed one year, the probation or law enforcement officer may
admit the probationer to bail; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The court, if there is probable cause to believe
that the defendant has committed another crime or has been held to answer
therefor, may commit the defendant without bail, pending a determination of the
charge by the court having jurisdiction thereof. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L
1986, c 314, §28; am L 1989, c 125, §1; am L 2001, c 24, §1 and c 91, §4]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §706-626</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The court, in order to control the conditions of suspension
or probation, must have power, either by summons or warrant, to require the
defendant to appear before the court.  Subsection (1) provides this power. 
Subsection (2) provides a more limited power for probation and peace officers;
they may arrest without a warrant only where there is probable cause to believe
that the defendant has failed to comply with a condition of probation or
suspension.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (3) is addressed to the problem presented by a
defendant who is on probation or under suspended sentence and who is accused or
charged with commission of another crime.  The commission of a crime while on
probation or under suspension of sentence would, in most cases, constitute a
violation of a condition of probation or suspension.  The question thus
presented is whether the issue of guilt, with respect to the most recent crime,
should be tried informally as a violation of a condition of suspension or
probation or whether the issue should be tried independently.  The Code resolves
this question by providing that the defendant may be held pending an
independent or formal determination by the court having jurisdiction over the
charge, thus preserving for the defendant all procedural rights.  This
subsection must be read in conjunction with §706-628(1) which provides for
revocation in cases where the defendant &quot;has been convicted of another
crime.&quot; </p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (1) is in substantial accord with prior law
governing the circuit courts.[1]  Subsection (2) is an addition to the law and
subsection (3) represents a slight departure from it.  The circuit court
apparently had the power--although it may choose not to exercise it--to decide,
in a probation proceeding, the issue of whether the defendant has committed a
crime during the period of probation.[2]</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-626</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 125, Session Laws 1989, required that a probationer be
placed in custody after arrest for a probation violation and permitted an
arrested probationer to post bail in certain circumstances.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 1331.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 24, Session Laws 2001, amended this section to authorize
probation or peace officers to admit defendants to bail when the punishment for
the original offense does not exceed one year.  Although law enforcement personnel
may set bail for petty misdemeanor and misdemeanor offenses, they are not
authorized to do so for probation violators and must defer to the courts.  The
legislature found that the ability to immediately arrest and set bail for petty
misdemeanor and misdemeanor probationers would allow more efficient processing
of probation violations.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1516, House
Standing Committee Report No. 547.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (3) should not be read to mean that statutes on
probation are concerned only with offenses committed after a defendant is
placed on probation.  Implications arising from this section and commentary
cannot be used to define language of §706-628(1).  62 H. 159, 612 P.2d 1168.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Evidentiary requirements of subsection (3), satisfaction of. 
1 H. App. 98, 614 P.2d 405.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under subsection (3), upon showing of probable cause court
has discretionary authority to commit without bail.  1 H. App. 98, 614 P.2d
405.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Motion to commit without bail pursuant to subsection (3) tolls
the period of probation.  1 H. App. 469, 620 P.2d 1082.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Period of probation which had been tolled begins to run again
after written entry of judgment.  4 H. App. 35, 658 P.2d 910.</p>
