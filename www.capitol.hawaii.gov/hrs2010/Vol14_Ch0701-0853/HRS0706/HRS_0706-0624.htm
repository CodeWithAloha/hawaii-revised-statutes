<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §706-624</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law provided the sentencing court with
limited guidance or control in the exercise of its discretion in imposing
conditions upon suspension of sentence or upon sentence to probation.  The
circuit court could impose &quot;such terms and conditions as it may deem best&quot;
and was specifically authorized to condition probation on (1) commitment to the
Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility, (2) periodic or intermittent confinement in
a county jail, (3) payment of a fine in a prescribed manner, (4) restitution or
reparation, and (5) providing support to a person for whose support the
defendant is legally responsible.[1]  District courts could condition
suspension of sentence on &quot;such terms and conditions as the magistrate may
deem best.&quot;  The magistrate was specifically authorized to condition
suspension on (1) periodic or intermittent confinement in jail, and (2)
attendance at a traffic course or school prescribed by the magistrate.[2]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Code seeks to focus on various appropriate conditions
without limiting unduly the exercise of judicial discretion.  Subsection (2)
presents various authorized conditions and subsection (2)(m) is intended to
insure flexibility for the court in devising the imposing conditions, provided
the &quot;conditions reasonably relate to the rehabilitation of the
defendant.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (3) continues past statutory authorization for
limited imprisonment as a condition of probation, but sets the maximum at six
months.  Probation and imprisonment are in some respects inconsistent with one
another.  Probation attempts to correct the defendant without interrupting the
defendant's contact with open society.  Imprisonment, on the other hand, is the
isolation of the defendant from open society.  Notwithstanding this area of
inconsistency, the Code recognizes the utility of providing a limited degree of
imprisonment as a possible condition of probation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (3) also continues the past policy of the law by
providing that the court may order that the term of imprisonment required to be
served as a condition of probation be served intermittently.  Thus, the court
may, for example, order that the defendant serve the defendant's period of
confinement at nights or on weekends so that undue economic hardship will not
result to the defendant or members of the defendant's family.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (4) is an addition to the law suggested by the
Model Penal Code and accepted in other states.[3]  The intent is to provide the
defendant with notice of what is expected of the defendant in a form which will
not escape the defendant's memory.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-624</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 136, Session Laws 1973, amended subsection (3) by
deleting a sentence which provided that upon revocation of probation any term
of imprisonment served as part of the probation shall not be credited toward
the subsequent imprisonment.  The Legislature felt that the allowance of credit
would do equity.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 858, House Standing
Committee Report No. 726.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 224, Session Laws 1978, amended §706-624(3) to authorize
a court when sentencing a felon to probation to impose a term of imprisonment
not exceeding one year as a condition of probation.  The amendment is intended
to give the court the discretion to require a convicted felon to serve a longer
term of imprisonment as a condition of probation than a person convicted of a
misdemeanor.  Under prior law the maximum term of imprisonment, whether for a
felon or for a misdemeanant, was set at six months.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 257, Session Laws 1984, added subsection (2)(g) to allow
a court, as a condition of a suspended sentence or probation, to restrict a
convicted person from entering certain geographical areas without the court's
permission.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 262, Session Laws 1987, amended this section to provide
home detention as an alternative to incarceration.  The use of home detention
is limited.  It is not meant to be used as a means to reduce the prison
population, or as a means to place a prisoner on probation or early release
where the prisoner is in need of intensive supervision or is not eligible or
qualified for early parole.  The legislature does not intend home detention to
be used by a court as justification to sentence a convicted person to probation
if the person would not otherwise be sentenced to probation under the existing
discretionary conditions.  Senate Conference Committee Report No. 61, House
Conference Committee Report No. 35.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 48, Session Laws 1989, required convicted persons on work
release to pay a percentage of their earnings for restitution.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 1133, House Standing Committee Report No. 629.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by, among
other things, (1) expanding the conditions of probation to include prohibiting
the defendant from engaging in criminal conduct in any foreign or military
jurisdiction that would constitute a crime under Hawaii law during the term of
probation; (2) requiring the defendant to make restitution to the victim if
ordered by the court; (3) increasing the terms of imprisonment that may be
imposed as part of a sentence of probation and including five days'
imprisonment for petty misdemeanors; and (4) including ammunition as an item
that a person on probation may be prohibited from possessing.  House Standing
Committee Report No. 665-06.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Condition that defendant &quot;refrain from company of people
of questionable character&quot; was not invalid for vagueness.  59 H. 366, 580
P.2d 1282.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Conditions imposed must be reasonable.  59 H. 378, 581 P.2d
759.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where time for performing condition is not specified,
performance is to be within a reasonable time.  59 H. 378, 581 P.2d 759.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Purpose and intent is to have convicted person make
restitution for criminal acts; court can delegate function of making
recommendations regarding restitution but cannot delegate sentencing function. 
68 H. 292, 711 P.2d 1295.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Requirement that defendant submit to periodic urinalysis for
drugs was proper.  72 H. 67, 806 P.2d 407.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  If, at a combined sentencing disposition, imprisonment is
imposed as a condition in more than one probation sentence, the period of
imprisonment served for concurrent sentences of probation shall not exceed the
maximum term allowed for a sentence of probation.  97 H. 430, 39 P.3d 557.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In a sentence of probation, imprisonment may be imposed only
as a condition of the sentence of probation, not to exceed the maximum term
established in subsection (2)(a).  97 H. 430, 39 P.3d 557.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A sentencing court may not impose discretionary conditions of
probation pursuant to subsection (2) unless there is a factual basis in the
record indicating that such conditions &quot;are reasonably related to the
factors set forth in §706-606&quot; and insofar as such &quot;conditions
involve only deprivations of liberty or property&quot;, that they are
reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in §706-606(2).  103 H. 462, 83
P.3d 725.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Based on defendant's history, the circumstances of the case,
and the seriousness of the offense, the family court did not exceed the bounds
of reason or disregard rules or principles of law to the substantial detriment
of defendant when it sentenced defendant to undergo sex offender evaluation and
treatment as a condition of probation.  107 H. 117, 111 P.3d 12.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A straightforward reading of subsection (3) prohibits the
adoption of an &quot;actual notice&quot; rule; thus, under the plain and
unambiguous language of subsection (3), it is mandated that defendants be given
written copies of their conditions.  118 H. 15, 185 P.3d 200.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In connection with the conditions from this section that are incorporated
by reference in §853-1, the &quot;provision&quot; in subsection (3) that
requires a defendant who is granted probation to be given a written copy of the
conditions, must necessarily apply to a defendant granted a deferred acceptance
of guilty plea, who must adhere to such similar conditions.   118 H. 15, 185
P.3d 200.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's probation may not be revoked for failure to
comply with special condition of probation, even though defendant was never
provided with written notice of that condition, as required by subsection (3).
10 H. App. 192, 862 P.2d 295.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Seven-day term of imprisonment was not unreasonably related
to factors set forth in §706-606, considering nature of offense and
circumstances presented by the record.  10 H. App. 381, 876 P.2d 1331.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Based on this statute and §706-671(1), sentencing court would
have no authority to sentence defendant to five years' probation and more than
one year in prison; furthermore, the court was required to credit defendant for
time already served in pre-trial detention.  79 H. 317 (App.), 901 P.2d 1296.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In light of paragraph (n), family court was authorized to
require defendant to undergo polygraph testing as a reasonable condition of the
granting of defendant's deferred acceptance of nolo contendere plea under
§853-1.  92 H. 289 (App.), 990 P.2d 1171.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where, pursuant to paragraph (3) (2005), defendant did not
receive a written copy of the conditions of defendant's deferred acceptance of
no contest plea, trial court erred in setting aside plea.  116 H. 38 (App.),
169 P.3d 990.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Family court did not abuse its discretion by requiring
defendant to attend domestic violence counseling as a condition of defendant's
probation; where defendant was charged with endangering the welfare of an
incompetent person under §709-905 based on substantial evidence that defendant
assaulted complainant, under subsection (2), the court was free to impose
discretionary conditions of probation that are reasonably related to the
factors set forth in §706-606 and to the extent that the conditions involve only
deprivations of liberty as is reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated
in §706-606(2).  121 H. 228 (App.), 216 P.3d 1251.</p>
