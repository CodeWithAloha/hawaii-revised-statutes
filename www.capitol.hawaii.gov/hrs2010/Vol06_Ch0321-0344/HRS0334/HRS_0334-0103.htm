<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§334-103  Program elements.</b>  The
following shall be the program elements of the system.  These shall be designed
to provide, at every level, alternatives to institutional settings.  Applicants
applying to operate program elements shall show how each of these elements
works with the current programs in the community the facility will serve. 
Applicants may apply for operation under the following program elements:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A short-term crisis residential alternative to
hospitalization for individuals experiencing an acute episode or situational
crisis.  The program shall be available for admissions twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.  The primary focus of this element shall be on reduction of
the crisis, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation, and assessment of the person's
existing support system, including recommendations for referrals upon
discharge.  This service in the program shall be designed for persons who would
otherwise be referred to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A long-term residential treatment program for
clients who would otherwise be living marginally in the community with little
or no service support, and who would return many times to the hospital for
treatment.  It also will serve those who are referred to, and maintained in, state
facilities or nursing homes, or private or public facilities or programs under
contract with the director pursuant to section 334-2.5, because they require
long-term, intensive support.  This service shall be designed to provide a
rehabilitation program for the so-called &quot;chronic&quot; patient who needs
long-term support in order to develop independent living skills.  This program
goes beyond maintenance to provide an active rehabilitation focus for these
individuals;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A transitional residential program designed for
persons who are able to take part in programs in the general community, but
who, without the support of counseling, as well as the therapeutic community,
would be at risk of returning to the hospital.  These programs may employ a
variety of staffing patterns and are for persons who are expected to move
toward a more independent living setting.  The clients shall be expected to
play a major role in the functioning of the household, and shall be encouraged
to accept increasing levels of responsibility, both in the residential
community, and in the community as a whole.  Residents are required to be
involved in daytime activities outside of the facility which are relevant to
their personal goals and conducive to their achieving more self-sufficiency; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  A semisupervised, independent, but structured
living arrangement for persons who do not need the intensive support of the
system elements of paragraph (1), (2), or (3), but who, without some support
and structure, are at risk of requiring hospitalization.  The small cooperative
housing units shall function as independent households with direct linkages to
staff support in case of emergencies, as well as for regular assessment and
evaluation meetings.  Individuals may use satellite housing as a transition to
independent living, or may remain in this setting indefinitely in order to
avoid the need for more intensive settings.  This element is for persons who
only need minimum professional or paraprofessional support in order to live in
the community.  These units should be as normative as the general living
arrangements in the communities in which they are developed. [L 1980, c 221, pt
of §2; am L 1985, c 219, §1; am L 1986, c 237, §2; am L 1997, c 220, §3; am L
1999, c 119, §7]</p>
