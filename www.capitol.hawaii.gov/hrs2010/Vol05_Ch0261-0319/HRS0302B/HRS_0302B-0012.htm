<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§302B-12  Funding and finance.  </b>(a) 
Beginning with fiscal year 2010-2011, and each fiscal year thereafter, the
non-facility general fund per-pupil funding request for charter school students
shall be the same as the general fund per-pupil amount to the department in the
most recently approved executive budget recommendation for the department, as
set forth in paragraph (2); provided that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The general fund per-pupil funding request shall
be based upon reasonable projected enrollment figures for all charter schools;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The general fund per-pupil request for each
regular education and special education student shall:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Include all general fund regular education
cost categories, including comprehensive school support services, but excluding
special education services, adult education, and the after-school plus program;
provided that these services are provided and funded by the department; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Exclude fringe benefit costs and debt
service.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Fringe benefit costs for charter school
employees, regardless of the payroll system utilized by a charter school, shall
be included in the department of budget and finance's annual budget request. 
No fringe benefit costs shall be charged directly to or deducted from the
charter school per-pupil allocations.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature shall make an appropriation
based upon the budget request; provided that the legislature may make
additional appropriations for facility and other costs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The governor, pursuant to chapter 37, may
impose restrictions or reductions on charter school appropriations similar to
those imposed on other public schools.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Charter schools shall be eligible for all
federal financial support to the same extent as all other public schools.  The
department shall provide the office with all state-level federal grant
proposals submitted by the department that include charter schools as potential
recipients and timely reports on state-level federal grants received for which
charter schools may apply or are entitled to receive.  Federal funds received
by the department for charter schools shall be transferred to the office for
distribution to charter schools in accordance with the federal requirements. 
If administrative services related to federal grants and subsidies are provided
to the charter school by the department, the charter school shall reimburse the
department for the actual costs of the administrative services in an amount
that shall not exceed six and one-half per cent of the charter school's federal
grants and subsidies.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Any charter school shall be eligible to receive
any supplemental federal grant or award for which any other public school may
submit a proposal, or any supplemental federal grants limited to charter
schools; provided that if department administrative services, including funds
management, budgetary, fiscal accounting, or other related services, are
provided with respect to these supplemental grants, the charter school shall
reimburse the department for the actual costs of the administrative services in
an amount that shall not exceed six and one-half per cent of the supplemental
grant for which the services are used.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     All additional funds generated by the local
school boards, that are not from a supplemental grant, shall be held separate
from allotted funds and may be expended at the discretion of the local school
boards.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The office shall calculate a general fund
per-pupil amount based upon the amount of general funds appropriated by the
legislature and released by the governor and the projected enrollment amount used
to calculate the general funds appropriated pursuant to subsection (a);
provided that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Per-pupil distributions to the charter schools
pursuant to subsection (e) shall be based upon the per-pupil amount as
calculated by the office pursuant to this subsection.  The per-pupil
distributions shall be deposited into the charter schools account established
by subsection (i); and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  In years when the projected enrollment used to
calculate the per-pupil amount pursuant to this subsection exceeds the total
actual enrollment as reported by the charter schools as of October 15, the
excess funds shall remain in the state treasury in the charter schools account;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  General funds appropriated pursuant to
this section remaining in the charter schools account within the state treasury
at the end of each fiscal year and in excess of $5,000,000 shall lapse to the
credit of the state general fund; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  General funds remaining in the charter
schools account in the state treasury appropriated pursuant to this section
that are less than $5,000,000 shall carry over to subsequent years to be used
to provide per-pupil funding in years when the projected enrollment amount is
less than the actual per-pupil enrollment reported by the charter schools on
October 15 of each year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The office shall submit a report to the
legislature no later than twenty days prior to each regular session that
contains each charter school's current school year projection that is used to
submit the budget request, the updated May 15 enrollment projection, the actual
October 15 enrollment count, the office's reviewed and verified enrollment
count, and the November 15 enrollment count.  This report shall also provide an
accounting of the use, if any, of state general funds subject to paragraph (2)(B).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  To enable charter schools to access state
funding prior to the start of each school year, foster their fiscal planning,
enhance their accountability, and avoid over-allocating general funds to
charter schools based on self-reported enrollment projections, the office
shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Provide sixty per cent of a charter school's
per-pupil allocation based on the charter school's projected student enrollment
no later than July 20 of each fiscal year; provided that the charter school
shall have submitted to the office a projected student enrollment no later than
May 15 of each year;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Provide an additional thirty per cent of a
charter school's per-pupil allocation no later than December 1 of each year,
based on the October 15 student enrollment, as reviewed and verified by the
office, only to schools in compliance with the office financial reporting
requirements; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Retain no more than the balance of the remaining
ten per cent of a charter school's per-pupil allocation, as a contingency
balance to ensure fiscal accountability and compliance, no later than June 30
of each year;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that the panel may make adjustments in
allocations based on noncompliance with board policies made in the board's
capacity as the state education agency, department directives made in the
department's capacity as the state education agency, the office's
administrative procedures, and board-approved accountability requirements.</p>

<p class=aSubsection>     (f)  Any check transferring a per-pupil allocation
from the office to a charter school under this section shall be co-signed by
the executive director and an authorized agent of the charter school review
panel.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The department shall provide appropriate
transitional resources to a conversion charter school for its first year of
operation as a charter school based upon the department's allocation to the
school for the year prior to the conversion.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  No start-up charter school or conversion
charter school may assess tuition.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='color:#C00000'>     </span>(i)  There
is created in the treasury of the State, as a separate account, the charter
schools account, into which shall be deposited per-pupil distributions in
accordance with subsection (d). [L 2006, c 298, pt of §2; am L 2007, c 115, §12;
am L 2009, c 86, §5; am L 2010, c 144, §8]</p>
