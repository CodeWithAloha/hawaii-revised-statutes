<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§302A-1611  Credits for excess contributions
or advance payment of required construction cost component impact fees.</b> 
(a)  Any owner of a development subject to the construction cost component
impact fee requirements pursuant to this subpart shall receive credit for any
similar contribution, payment, or construction of public school facilities
accepted and received by the department for the portion of the development that
is in excess of the impact fee required under this subpart for that
development.  No credit shall be authorized against the impact fees in lieu.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A credit may be applied only against
school impact fees that would otherwise be due for new residential developments
for which the payment or contribution was agreed to in a written educational
contribution agreement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Excess contribution credit may be applied
to the construction cost component impact fee requirement for any future
development by the same owner in the same school impact district, or with the
written approval of the owner of the credit, to any future development by a
different owner in the same school impact district.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  In addition to or instead of applying the
credits to future developments, the department may execute with an owner of the
credits an agreement to provide for partial or full reimbursement from the
impact fee payments collected from other developers within the same school
impact district.&nbsp; The reimbursements shall not exceed the amount of the
impact fee revenues available in the account for that school impact district.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Any owner of a development shall receive
credit for any part of its required construction cost component impact fee
that, with the approval of the department, is paid in advance of the time
specified in the written agreement executed in accordance with section
302A-1607(h).  The department shall maintain an accounting of the amount of the
credit applicable to the new residential development and shall reduce the
amount of the credit by the amount of the impact fees that would otherwise be
due for each building permit issued for the new residential development.  After
the credit balance is exhausted, no additional credits shall be applied to
subsequent building permits issued within the new residential development.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  If private construction of school
facilities is proposed by a developer after July 1, 2010, if the proposed
construction is acceptable to the department, and if the value of the proposed
construction exceeds the total impact fees that would be due from the
development, the department shall execute with the developer an agreement to
provide reimbursement for the excess credit from the impact fees collected from
other developers within the same benefit district.  For the purposes of this
section, the private construction of school facilities is a &quot;public
work&quot; pursuant to chapter 104. [L 2007, c 245, pt of §2; am L 2010, c 188,
§14]</p>
