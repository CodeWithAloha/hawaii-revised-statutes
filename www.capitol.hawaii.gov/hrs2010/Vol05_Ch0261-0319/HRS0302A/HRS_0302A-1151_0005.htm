<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§302A-1151.5]&nbsp; Use of vacant public
school facilities by charter schools. </b> (a)  When the department considers
whether to close any particular public school, it shall simultaneously give
reasonable consideration to making all or portions of the facilities of the
public school available for the exclusive occupancy and use by a charter school
or joint occupancy and use by the charter school and the department; provided
that the department may elect to use the facilities for the support of public education
programs, with preference given to instructional uses over administrative uses.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The department shall submit a notice of
possible availability of a public school to the charter school review panel as
early as possible; provided that if a vacancy is established, a notice of
vacancy shall be submitted to the charter school review panel no later than
thirty days after the establishment of the vacancy.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Pursuant to section 302B-3.6 and upon
receipt of a notice pursuant to subsection (b), the charter school review panel
shall solicit applications from charter schools interested in using and
occupying all or portions of the facilities of the public school and submit a
prioritized list of charter schools to the department for final determination
of which charter school, if any, shall be authorized to use and occupy the
public school facilities.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Upon the selection of a charter school to
use a vacant school facility or portion of a school facility, the department
and the charter school review panel shall enter into necessary agreements
within ninety days of the selection to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  After receipt by the charter school review
panel of a notice pursuant to subsection (b), if the charter school review
panel does not provide a prioritized list of charter schools because no charter
school has requested to use the facilities of the public school, or if the
department receives the prioritized list but determines that no charter school
on the list is an appropriate candidate to occupy and use the facilities, the
department shall give reasonable consideration to making all or portions of the
facilities of the public school, if closed, available for occupancy and use for
other educational purposes.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  T<span style='background:white'>he
department shall adopt rules</span> <span style='background:white'>necessary to
carry out the purposes of this section</span>.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  For purposes of this section, &quot;public
school&quot; means any school that falls within the definition of public
schools in section 302A-101, except for charter schools. [L 2010, c 144, §2]</p>
