<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§554G-5]  Trust instrument.</b>  (a)  A
trust instrument shall be irrevocable and shall expressly incorporate the laws
of this State governing the validity, construction, and administration of the
trust.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The trustee, in its discretion, may
terminate any trust if and when its fair market value has declined to the
extent that would make it uneconomical, imprudent, or unwise to continue to
retain the trust, and shall pay and distribute the trust to the persons
entitled to mandatory or discretionary income distributions as the trustee in
the trustee's absolute discretion shall decide.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A trust instrument shall not be deemed
revocable on account of the inclusion of:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A transferor's power to veto a distribution from
the trust;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A power of appointment other than a power to
appoint to the transferor, the transferor's creditors, the transferor's estate,
or the creditors of the transferor's estate that may be exercised by will or
other written instrument of the transferor effective only upon the transferor's
death;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The transferor's potential or actual receipt of
income, including rights to income retained in the trust instrument;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The transferor's annual receipt of a percentage
not to exceed five per cent of the initial value of the trust assets or its
value determined from time to time pursuant to the trust instrument or of a
fixed amount that on an annual basis does not exceed five per cent of the
initial value of the trust assets;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The transferor's potential or actual receipt or
use of the trust's principal due to the discretionary action of a permitted
trustee or to a provision in the trust instrument that governs the distribution
of principal; provided that any included provision shall not confer upon the
transferor a substantially unfettered right to the receipt or use of the
principal;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  The transferor's right to remove a permitted
trustee or advisor and to appoint a new permitted trustee or advisor;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  The transferor's potential or actual receipt of
income or principal to pay income taxes due on income of the trust if the trust
instrument includes a provision allowing or directing the use of trust funds to
pay income taxes due, or if the permitted trustee acts in the trustee's
discretion to allow payment of income taxes due on the trust income; or </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  A permitted trustee's authority pursuant to
discretion, direction, or the transferor's exercise of a testamentary power of
appointment to pay all or any part of the transferor's debts outstanding at the
time of the transferor's death, the expenses of administering the transferor's
estate, or any estate or inheritance tax imposed on or with respect to the
transferor's estate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A trust instrument may provide that the
interest of a beneficiary of the trust, including a beneficiary who is the
transferor of the trust, may not be transferred, assigned, pledged, or
mortgaged, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, before the permitted trustee
actually distributes the property or income to the beneficiary.  Any provision
of this type contained in the trust instrument shall be deemed to be a
restriction on the transfer of the transferor's beneficial interest in the
trust that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law within the meaning
of 11 United States Code section 541(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
successor provision.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A transferor may appoint, through the
trust instrument, one or more advisors or protectors, including the following:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Advisors who have authority under the terms of
the trust to remove and appoint permitted trustees, advisors, or protectors;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Advisors who have authority under the terms of
the trust to direct, consent to, or disapprove of distributions from the trust;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Advisors, including the transferor beneficiary of
the trust, who serve as investment advisors to the trust.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Whenever there shall be a dispute,
deadlock, or difference of opinion between a permitted trustee and an advisor,
the transferor may direct that the determination of the advisor shall be
binding upon the permitted trustee, but that the permitted trustee shall bear
no liability or accountability for any act or transaction entered into as a
result of the enforcement of the advisor's privilege if the permitted trustee
dissents in writing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  If a trustee of a trust existing prior to
the enactment of this chapter proposes to make a permitted transfer, but the
trust instrument does not contain a power of appointment that conforms to
section 554G-5(c)(2), the trustee may deliver an irrevocable written election
to have section 554G-5(c)(2) apply to the trust, and the nonconforming powers
of appointment shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform with
section 554G-5(c)(2).  The irrevocable written election shall include a
description of the original transferor's powers of appointment as modified, and
the original transferor's written consent to the modification.  Consent of the
original transferor to a modification of powers of appointment shall not be
considered to be a permitted transfer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  If, in any action brought against a
trustee of a trust that results from a permitted transfer, a court declines to
apply the law of this State in determining the validity, construction, or
administration of the trust, or the effect of a spendthrift provision of the trust,
the trustee, immediately upon the court's action and without the further order
of any court, shall cease to be trustee of the trust and a successor trustee
shall thereupon succeed as trustee in accordance with the terms of the trust
instrument.  If the trust instrument does not provide for a successor trustee
or does not provide for an advisor or protector with powers to appoint
successor trustees, a Hawaii court of competent jurisdiction shall appoint a
successor permitted trustee upon the application of any beneficiary of the
trust under any terms and conditions that the court determines to be consistent
with the purposes of the trust and with this chapter.  Upon the removal of a
trustee pursuant to this section, the trustee who has been removed shall have
no power or authority other than to convey the trust property to the successor
trustee. [L 2010, c 182, pt of §2]</p>
