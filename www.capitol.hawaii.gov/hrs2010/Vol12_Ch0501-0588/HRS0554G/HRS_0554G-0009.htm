<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Any person to whom the transferor is indebted on
account of a family court-supervised agreement or family court order for the
payment of support or alimony to the transferor's spouse, former spouse, or

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Any person who suffers death, personal injury, or
property damage on or before the date of a permitted transfer; provided that
the death, personal injury, or property damage is determined to have been
caused in whole or in part by the tortious act or omission of either the
transferor or another person for whom the transferor is or was vicariously
liable to the extent of the transferor's liability or vicarious liability;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any lender who extends a secured or
collateralized loan to the transferor based on the transferor's or the
transferor's agent's express or implied representation that the assets of a
trust established under this chapter would be available as security against the
loan in the event of the transferor's default thereon; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The State of Hawaii to the extent that a transfer

liabilities. [L 2010, c 182, pt of §2]</p>
