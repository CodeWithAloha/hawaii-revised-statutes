<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§554G-10]  Effect of avoidance of permitted
transfers.  </b>(a)  A creditor may avoid a permitted transfer pursuant to
section&nbsp;554G-8 only to the extent necessary to satisfy the transferor's
debt to the creditor at whose instance the transfer has been avoided, together
with costs, including attorney's fees, as allowed by a court.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  In an action pursuant to subsection (a) to
avoid a permitted transfer:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  If a court finds that a trustee has not acted
with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay the creditor in accepting or
administering the property that is the subject of the permitted transfer:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  The trustee shall have a first and
paramount lien against the property that is the subject of the permitted
transfer in an amount equal to the entire cost, including attorney's fees,
properly incurred by the trustee in the defense of the action or proceedings to
avoid the permitted transfer; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The permitted transfer shall be avoided,
subject to payment of proper fees, costs, preexisting rights, claims, and
interests of the trustee and of any predecessor trustee who has not acted with
intent to defraud, hinder, or delay the creditor; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  If the court is satisfied that a beneficiary of
the trust has not acted with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay the creditor,
the permitted transfer shall be avoided subject to the beneficiary's right to
retain any distribution made prior to the creditor's commencement of an action
to avoid the permitted transfer.  For purposes of this paragraph, it shall be
presumed that a beneficiary did not act with intent to defraud, hinder, or
delay the creditor merely by creating the trust or by accepting a distribution
made in accordance with the terms of the trust.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A creditor who brings an action pursuant
to section&nbsp;554G-8 to avoid a permitted trust shall have the burden of
proving by clear and convincing evidence that a trustee or beneficiary acted
with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay the creditor; provided that in the
case of a beneficiary who is also the transferor, the burden on the creditor
shall be to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the
transferor-beneficiary acted with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay the
creditor.  Mere acceptance of permitted property by a trustee shall not
constitute evidence of intent to defraud, hinder, or delay a creditor.  </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this chapter, a creditor shall have no right against the interest of a
beneficiary to a trust based solely on the beneficiary's right to authorize or
direct the trustee to use all or part of the trust property to pay:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Estate or inheritance taxes imposed upon or due
to the beneficiary's estate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Debts of the beneficiary's estate; or </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Expenses of administering the beneficiary's
estate[,]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>unless the beneficiary actually directs the payment
of taxes, debts, or expenses and then only to the extent of that direction. [L
2010, c 182, pt of §2]</p>
