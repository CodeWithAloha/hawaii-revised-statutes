terminated by death or removal, shall adopt the statements in the application
or petition which led to the appointment of the person being succeeded except
as specifically changed or corrected, state the name and address of the person
who seeks appointment as successor, and describe the priority of the applicant.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  By verifying an application for informal
