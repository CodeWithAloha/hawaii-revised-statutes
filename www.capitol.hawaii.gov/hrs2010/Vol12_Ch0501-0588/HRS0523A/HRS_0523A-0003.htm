<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  A demand, savings, or time deposit, including a
deposit that is automatically renewable, five years after the earlier of
maturity or the date of the last indication by the owner of interest in the property;
provided that a deposit that is automatically renewable is deemed matured for
purposes of this section upon its initial date of maturity, unless the owner
has consented to a renewal at or about the time of the renewal and the consent
is in writing or is evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the
holder;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Money or credits owed to a customer as a result
of a retail business transaction, five years after the obligation accrued;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Gift certificate not exempt under section 523A-3.5,
five years after December 31 of the year in which the certificate was sold, but
if redeemable in merchandise only, the amount abandoned shall be deemed to be

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Amount owed by an insurer on a life or endowment
insurance policy or an annuity that has matured or terminated, five years after

attained if living, the limiting age under the mortality table on which the
reserve is based;</p>

agreement governing the plan, or the date, if determinable by the holder,
specified in the income tax laws of the United States by which distribution of
the property shall begin to avoid a tax penalty; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (15)  All other property, five years after the owner's
right to demand the property or after the obligation to pay or distribute the

abandoned under subsection (a), any other property right accrued or accruing to
the owner as a result of the interest, and not previously presumed abandoned,
shall also be presumed abandoned.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Property is unclaimed if, for the
applicable period set forth in subsection (a), the apparent owner has not
communicated in writing or by other means reflected in a contemporaneous record
prepared by or on behalf of the holder, with the holder concerning the property
or the account in which the property is held, and has not otherwise indicated
an interest in the property.  A communication with an owner by a person other
than the holder or its representative who has not in writing identified the
property to the owner shall not be an indication of interest in the property by
the owner.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  An indication of an owner's interest in
property includes:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The presentment of a check or other instrument of

bank account; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The payment of a premium with respect to a
property interest in an insurance policy; but the application of an automatic
premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision contained in an
insurance policy shall not prevent a policy from maturing or terminating if the
insured has died or the insured or the beneficiary of the policy has otherwise
become entitled to the proceeds before the depletion of the cash surrender
value of a policy by the application of those provisions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Property shall be payable or distributable
for purposes of this part notwithstanding the owner's failure to make demand or
present an instrument or document otherwise required to obtain payment. [L
2008, c 55, pt of §1]</p>
