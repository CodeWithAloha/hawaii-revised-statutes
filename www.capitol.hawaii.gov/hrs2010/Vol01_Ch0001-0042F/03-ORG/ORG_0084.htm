<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §84.  Disqualification by relationship,
pecuniary interest, or previous judgment.</b>  That no person shall sit as a
judge or juror in any case in which his relative by affinity or by
consanguinity within the third degree is interested, either as a plaintiff or
defendant, or in the issue of which the said judge or juror has, either
directly or through such relative, any pecuniary interest; nor shall any person
sit as a judge in any case in which he has been of counsel or on an appeal from
any decision or judgment rendered by him, and the legislature of the Territory
may add other causes of disqualification to those herein enumerated. [Am
May&nbsp;27, 1910, c 258, §6, 36 Stat 447; rep L Sp 1959 1st, c 5, §8]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As to other causes of disqualification added by legislature,
see HRS §601-7.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Interest and relationship.  A circuit judge may sit in a suit
brought by a deputy of his son as assessor in the name of the government, the
son being paid a regular salary:  10 H. 5.  A justice of the supreme court may
sit in a disbarment case, although he and his father-in-law were interested in
a corporation, in connection with dealings with which, the attorney,
representing other parties, was alleged to have acted unprofessionally: 15 H.
380; 2 U.S.D.C. Haw. 58.  A judge is not disqualified by the fact that a
relative within the third degree is a shareholder in a corporation which is a
party, the judge having no pecuniary interest through such relative:  18 H.
510; 20 H. 617.  Wife's interest as life beneficiary of income from stock and
judge's contingent interest in income, disqualification:  35 H. 786, 811. 
Ownership in stock of corporate trustee which might be individually liable,
disqualification:  33 H. 565.  Relationship by affinity within the third degree
to the son of a party, is not disqualification: 20 H. 434; but such
relationship to a party, though the party is such merely as trustee, is a
disqualification:  20 H. 262; a judge is not disqualified from sitting in a
partition suit by a reason of having ordered a fee paid to an attorney out of
the fund in court for defending the judge a prohibition case which arose out of
the partition case:  22 H. 641; appointment of trustee by majority of justices
of supreme court acting as individuals under power in will does not disqualify
them from sitting on appeal from decree holding such appointment invalid and
appointing a different trustee:  250 Fed. 145, affirming 23 H. 575.  Cited in
29 H. 256; 29 H. 438; 29 H. 560; 31 H. 150.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Bias and prejudice; counsel:  A justice of supreme court
should not sit in a case in which he would have to pass on effect of his own
testimony:  10 H. 354; but may sit in a disbarment case although he had several
times as circuit judge punished the attorney for contempt:  15 H. 377; 2
U.S.D.C. Haw. 59; for although he had referred the question of unprofessional
conduct to the attorney general for investigation and action if necessary:  2
U.S.D.C. Haw. 57.  Before this § was amended a judge was held not disqualified
by reason of having been of counsel if he had not taken an active part in the
case:  17 H. 194; questioned 22 H. 246; or even if he had taken an active
part:  17 H. 394, questioned 22 H. 246; 18 H. 375, questioned 22 H. 246; or by
reason of having expressed approval of an act, involved in the case, to a
member of a legislative committee when the bill was before it:  17 H. 429.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the amendment a judge is not disqualified from sitting
in an action of ejectment by reason of having been of counsel in an action for
summary possession of the same land:  20 H. 548; nor from ordering a guardian
to file an account and inventory by reason of having acted as counsel for the
appointment of the guardian:  20 H. 553; and for purposes of disqualification
there is no distinction between attorney and counsel:  22 H. 245.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A judge is disqualified by having been a member of a firm
which was retained although he took no part in the case and had no knowledge of
the issues:  26 H. 406; and likewise in a prohibition proceeding where the firm
was retained generally to accomplish a purpose and defended in a mandamus
proceeding and later in the prohibition proceeding although the latter was
brought after the judge left the firm:  27 H. 62.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Acceptance of retainer to bring divorce proceedings does not
disqualify district magistrate from sitting as judge upon trial of criminal
offense against libellee not included in grounds for divorce.  27 H. 509, 524. 
A general employment involving title to land is the same &quot;case&quot; as an
equitable action to quiet title to such land:  27 H. 637.  See 18 H. 602
(gratuitous advice by judge).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This § was held not to apply to a federal district judge in
Hawaii, but was considered argumentatively in support of a ruling that having
been of counsel, whether actively or merely nominally, was a disqualification: 
4 U.S.D.C. Haw. 4; but a judge so disqualified may act in purely formal
matters:  Id.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  On appeal.  A justice of the supreme court may sit on an
appeal in a habeas corpus case brought to obtain the release of a prisoner held
under sentence pronounced in a criminal case by such justice when he was a
circuit judge:  13 H. 570; also in a case with which he has no previous
connection, although a question of law is involved which was involved in other
distinct cases at the trial of which he had presided when a circuit judge:  13
H. 534; and in a disbarment case, although he had previously as circuit judge
passed on the insanity of one alleged to have been taken advantage of by the
attorney:  15 H. 377; 2 U.S.D.C. Haw. 59.  A justice is disqualified from
sitting in a case where the validity of an order made by him as circuit judge
is attacked:  20 H. 617.  Formerly under the provision of C.C. 1859, §820,
against sitting &quot;alone&quot; on appeal, etc., a justice could sit with the
other justices on appeal from himself:  3 H. 30; 9 H. 354; or preside over a
jury on appeal from himself:  4 H. 431; but not sit alone, jury waived, on such
an appeal:  6 H. 304.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  New trial.  A circuit judge may sit on a petition for the
revocation of the probate of a will admitted to probate by himself:  10 H. 188;
or on the second trial of a case in which the jury had disagreed at the first
trial:  11 H. 322; or in an equity case remanded to him for evidence on an
issue raised by an amendment of the pleadings made after the close of the
original hearing:  14 H. 3; or on a motion for a change of venue on the ground
that an impartial jury cannot be obtained, after he had ordered a non-suit,
which had been set aside by the supreme court:  16 H. 477; or upon a trial of
the facts, after sustaining defendant's demurrer, which ruling had been
reversed on appeal:  19 H. 197.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Referred to in 217 U.S. 244; 22 H. 576; 16 H. 245; 31 H. 920,
928; 37 H. 40; 41 H. 270, 234 P.2d 221.</p>
