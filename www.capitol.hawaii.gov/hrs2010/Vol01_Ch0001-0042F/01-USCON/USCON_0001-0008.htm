<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Commerce.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Fifth Amendment's takings clause precludes federal government
from exercising commerce clause authority to promote navigation.  444 U.S. 164.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Liquor tax exemption for okolehao and pineapple wine violated
commerce clause because it had both purpose and effect of discriminating in
favor of local products.  468 U.S. 263.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Lagoon formed from littoral Hawaiian fishpond was incapable
of use as continuous highway for purpose of navigation in interstate commerce,
not subject to federal navigational servitude.  944 F.2d 1489.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No commerce clause violation by state anchoring and mooring
regulations where state's interest in having regulations for public safety is
substantial and there is little burden on interstate commerce.  42 F.3d 1185.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant argued that Congress exceeded its authority
under commerce clause when it enacted 21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1), i.e., defendant
contended, inter alia, that possession of a controlled substance is not
necessarily a commercial activity that may be regulated under commerce clause,
defendant's commerce clause argument lacked merit.  94 F.3d 1247.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant who entered conditional guilty pleas to two
counts of illegal possession of a firearm, contended that 18 U.S.C. §922(g), as
applied to defendant, represented an unconstitutional extension of Congress'
power to regulate interstate commerce, and that §922(g) could not be justified
as having a substantial effect on interstate commerce, district court's denial
of defendant's motion to dismiss on commerce clause grounds affirmed.  479 F.3d
1153.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Airline engaged in interstate and foreign commerce subject to
suit in Hawaii.  253 F. Supp. 588.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Control share acquisition law is unconstitutional because it
directly burdens interstate commerce and its indirect burden on commerce
outweighs its benefits.  643 F. Supp. 161.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Congress is provided with the exclusive authority to regulate
the nation's waterways.  725 F. Supp. 1509.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's motion to dismiss indictment alleging that
defendant violated 18 U.S.C. §922(g) by possessing a rifle and ammunition while
being an unlawful user of a controlled substance denied, where defendant argued
that the statute, as applied to the facts of the case, was an unconstitutional
exercise of Congress' commerce clause authority.  351 F. Supp. 2d 1045.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to raise a
question of fact as to whether the seasonal ban on parasailing imposed clearly
excessive burdens on interstate commerce. 380 F. Supp. 2d 1160.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not all burdens imposed by a state upon commerce, but only
undue or discriminatory ones, are forbidden.  46 H. 269, 379 P.2d 336; 48 H.
486, 405 P.2d 382.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  General excise tax on commissions received by travel agencies
does not offend the commerce clause if (1) it does not discriminate against
interstate commerce, (2) it is fairly apportioned so as to cover only income
attributable to activity within state, (3) it does not subject interstate
commerce to cumulative taxation.  53 H. 419, 495 P.2d 1172.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A tax upon out-of-state company's income based upon leased
telecast rights exercisable only in Hawaii held not unconstitutional burden on
interstate commerce.  57 H. 175, 554 P.2d 242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where comparison between out-of-state taxpayer and its in-state
counterpart shows tax advantage to the former, such taxpayer has no ground to
complain that use tax violates the commerce clause.  58 H. 163, 566 P.2d 1091.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Imposition of public service company tax on interisland air
carrier was not undue burden on commerce.  65 H. 1, 647 P.2d 263.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation in exempting certain locally produced products
from liquor tax.  65 H. 566, 656 P.2d 724.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation of commerce clause by Hawaii's imposition of
general excise tax on Delaware corporation which sold books to the state
library where corporation's presence in Hawaii was a continuous process of
sales and service creating a substantial legal nexus with Hawaii, and tax was &quot;internally&quot;
and &quot;externally&quot; consistent for fair apportionment of taxable
income.  103 H. 359, 82 P.3d 804.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Necessary and proper.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Migratory Bird Treaty Act was upheld by Supreme Court under
necessary and proper clause and Article II treaty-making power.  103 F.3d 1475.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Treaty power coupled with the necessary and proper clause
provided Congress with an additional source of authority to apply federal
statute beyond U.S. borders.  525 F.3d 709.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Respondent contended that Congress exceeded its authority in
enacting 18 U.S.C. §4248 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act as
applied to persons, like respondent, who are in the custody of the Bureau of
Prisons, but whose sentences have expired; Congress did not exceed its
authority in enacting a civil commitment scheme that applies to persons in the
custody of the Bureau of Prisons.  574 F. Supp. 2d 1123.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Taxing and spending.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Allegation that State improperly administers unemployment
compensation program is not sufficient to confer standing to challenge federal
contributions to state program.  691 F.2d 905.</p>
