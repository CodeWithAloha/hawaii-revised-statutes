<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant, a wholesale food marketer and distributor,

corporation for purposes of §480-9 or this section.  91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the two companies were wholly-owned subsidiaries of the
same parent corporation and shared a singular economic interest, they could not
constitute a plurality of actors for purposes of a conspiracy under §480-9 or
this section.  91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.</p>
