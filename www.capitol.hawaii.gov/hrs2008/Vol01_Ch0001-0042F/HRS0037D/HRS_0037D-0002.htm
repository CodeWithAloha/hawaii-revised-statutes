<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     </b><b>§37D-2  Financing agreements</b>. 
(a)  There is hereby established and authorized the financing agreement program
of the State.  Any agency desiring to acquire or improve projects through the
financing agreement program established and authorized by this chapter shall
submit a written request to the department providing any information that the
department shall require.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, and
except for the Hawaii health systems corporation and its regional system
boards, only with the approval by the attorney general as to form and legality
and upon the written request of one or more agencies may the department enter
into a financing agreement in accordance with this chapter, and only with the
approval by the attorney general as to form and legality, and by the director
as to fiscal responsibility,<span style='color:black'> and</span> upon the
written request of an agency, the agency may <span style='color:black'>enter
into a financing agreement in accordance with this chapter,</span> except that
the department of education may enter into a financing agreement in accordance
with section 36-32 with the concurrence of the director and with the approval
of the attorney general as to form and legality; and that the board of regents
of the University of Hawaii may enter into a financing agreement in accordance
with this chapter without the approval of the director and of the attorney
general as to form and legality if the principal amount of the financing
agreement does not exceed $3,000,000.  A financing agreement may be entered
into by the department on behalf of one or more agencies, or by an agency, at
any time (before or after commencement or completion of any improvements or
acquisitions to be financed) and shall be upon terms and conditions the
department finds to be advantageous.  In each case of a written request by the
judiciary to participate in the financing agreement program, the department
shall implement the request; provided that the related financing agreement
shall be upon terms and conditions the department finds to be advantageous.  Any
financing agreement entered into by the department without the approval, or by
an agency without the approvals required by this section shall be void and of
no effect.  A single financing agreement entered into by the department may
finance a single item or multiple items of property to be used by multiple
agencies or may finance a single item or multiple items of property to be used
by a single agency.  If the financing agreement is by the department, the
department shall bill any agency that benefits from property acquired with the
proceeds of a financing agreement for the agency's pro rata share of:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The department's costs of administration of the
financing agreement program; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The financing costs, including the principal and
interest components of the financing agreement and insurance premiums,</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>on a monthly or other periodic basis, and may
deposit payments received in connection with the billings with a trustee as
security for the financing agreement.  Any agency receiving such a bill shall be
authorized and shall pay the amounts billed from available moneys.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If a financing agreement is by an agency, the
agency shall deposit on a monthly or other periodic basis with the department,
payments from available moneys with respect to the agency's financing costs,
including the principal and interest components of the financing agreement and
insurance premiums, which payments the department may deposit with a trustee as
security for the financing agreement.  The department may bill an agency for the
department's costs of administering the agency's payments and the agency
receiving such a bill shall be authorized to and shall pay the amounts billed
from available moneys.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Financing agreements shall be subject to
the following limitations:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Amounts payable by an agency to or upon the
direction of the department in respect to a project and by the department or an
agency under a financing agreement shall be limited to available moneys.  In no
circumstance shall the department or an agency be obligated to pay amounts due
under a financing agreement from any source other than available moneys.  If,
by reason of insufficient available moneys or other reason, amounts due under a
financing agreement are not paid when due, the lender may exercise any property
right that the department or the agency has granted to it in the financing
agreement, against the property that was purchased with the proceeds of the
financing agreement, and apply the amounts so received toward payments
scheduled to be made by the department or the agency under the financing
agreement;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  No property rights may be granted in property
unless the property is being acquired, is to be substantially improved, is to
be refinanced with the proceeds of a financing agreement, or is land on which
the property is located;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary,
and except for the Hawaii health systems corporation and its regional system
boards, and as otherwise provided in this section with respect to the
department of education and the University of Hawaii, and except as provided in
chapter&nbsp;323F as to the Hawaii health systems corporation and its regional
system boards, an agency shall not have the power to enter into a financing
agreement, except as authorized by this chapter, and nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to authorize the sale, lease, or other disposition of
property owned by an agency;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Except as otherwise provided in this section with
respect to the department of education and the University of Hawaii, the sale,
assignment, or other disposition of any financing agreements, including
certificates of participation relating thereto, shall require the approval of
the director; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The department or the agency proposing to enter
into a financing agreement shall not be subject to chapter&nbsp;103D and any
and all other requirements of law for competitive bidding for financing
agreements. [L 1996, c 119, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 41, §6; am L 1999, c 31, §1;
