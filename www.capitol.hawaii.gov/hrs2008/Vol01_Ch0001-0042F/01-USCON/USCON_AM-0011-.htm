<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The Judicial power of the United States shall

prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by
Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources:
State Governments Fall Prey to the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  10 Ecology
Law Quarterly 281.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Palila v. Department of Land and Natural Resources:

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Award of attorneys' fees to Legal Aid Society in civil rights
action against State not prohibited.  611 F.2d 1302.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Congress may provide for award of attorneys' fees against
state officials acting in their official capacities.  611 F.2d 1302.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because true purpose of action was to recover from state
treasury, failure to name State as defendant was immaterial to state
defendants' Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Framing of claim as action under 42
U.S.C. 1983 does not abrogate or &quot;override&quot; sovereign immunity.  693
F.2d 928.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State waived immunity where it participated in federally
funded and regulated special education program for handicapped children.  727
F.2d 809.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Did not bar action to enjoin state officials from disbursing
public funds to &quot;Hawaiians&quot;.  Principals of qualified immunity do not
protect state officials from actions to enjoin exercise of authority under
allegedly unconstitutional state law.  741 F.2d 1169.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State did not waive immunity from suit by native Hawaiian
group; prospective injunctive relief proper for violation of federal law by
state official.  764 F.2d 623.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Bars federal court from hearing suit against State in absence
of consent in state law under which suit brought; university personnel shared
State's immunity against suit.  791 F.2d 759.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred action against State for allegedly violating antitrust
laws by entering into exclusive franchise contract for taxi service from
airport.  810 F.2d 869.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The United States may bring suits against the State.  832
F.2d 1116.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Bars citizen's suits for retrospective relief (damages)
against state official acting in official capacity.  902 F.2d 1395.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Native Hawaiians' claim that trustees of office of Hawaiian
affairs violated Admission Act not barred where action was brought against
trustees in their individual, rather than official, capacities.  928 F.2d 824.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Grants states immunity from retroactive monetary relief in
federal court.  961 F.2d 852.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred inmate's suit against State and individual defendants
in their official capacities, but not against individual defendants in their
personal capacities.  15 F.3d 1463.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred suit against state officials in official capacities
for alleged breach of trust in approving third party agreements permitting
agricultural use of homelands by non-native Hawaiians where plaintiffs sought
only retrospective relief.  45 F.3d 333.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Bars federal courts from deciding claims against state
officials based solely on state law.  45 F.3d 333.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State officials sued in individual capacities were entitled
to qualified immunity where they reasonably believed, based on their good faith
reliance on substantial legal opinion, that third party agreements permitting
agricultural use of homelands by non-native Hawaiians met the statutory
standard.  45 F.3d 333.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Eleventh Amendment bar against some of the claims of an
action originally brought in state court does not prevent removal of the action
to federal court.  68 F.3d 331.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State employees entitled to 42 U.S.C. §1983 qualified
immunity where plaintiff did not have clearly established parental right to be
free from state child care intervention in the form of suggested counseling and
drug testing.  68 F.3d 331.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff failed to show sufficient likelihood that
state child protective services agency would violate plaintiff's privacy rights
in the future, plaintiff lacked standing to seek injunctive relief against
agency.  68 F.3d 331.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Court did not lack jurisdiction because of Eleventh
Amendment.  What plaintiffs objected to was not the mere occurrence of an
allegedly unfair vote, but the State's decision to give effect to that vote;
plaintiffs sought prospective, not retrospective, relief.  140 F.3d 1218.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendants (&quot;State&quot;) appealed denial of
State's motion for partial summary judgment on question whether punitive
damages are available against a state under Title II of the Americans with
Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and urged panel to
ground its subject matter jurisdiction in Cohen collateral order doctrine,
State failed to satisfy third criterion of Cohen test, rendering district
court's order denying State's motion an unappealable collateral order; State
was not claiming sovereign immunity from suit in federal court; State invoked
Eleventh Amendment merely as a defense to liability for punitive damages under
Title II and Section 504.  165 F.3d 1257.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Did not bar plaintiffs' suits under Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act or §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  303 F.3d 1039.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Supreme Court's conclusion that a court of appeals has
jurisdiction over a district court's non-final order denying a state's claim to
Eleventh Amendment immunity under the collateral order doctrine applies whether
or not an Ex Parte Young claim survives the motion stage of the litigation. 
309 F.3d 1203.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Lawsuit against state officials by plaintiffs, Hawai'i
medicaid recipients who suffered from tobacco-related illnesses, not barred by
sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, where plaintiffs alleged that
the officials violated and continued to violate federal disbursement rules for
medicaid recovery.  311 F.3d 929.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State defendants did not waive sovereign immunity regarding
appellant's state law claims by filing the third-party complaint; they had
timely asserted immunity prior to filing the third-party complaint and the
third-party complaint was a defensive move which was not incompatible with an
intent to preserve sovereign immunity.  488 F.3d 1144.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State of Hawaii was protected from suit by an individual,
whether the individual was a citizen of another state or of Hawaii.  315 F.
Supp. 729.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A suit to restrain unconstitutional act of state officer is
not a suit against the State.  402 F. Supp. 95.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State could be enjoined from violating the Endangered Species
Act and required to eradicate feral sheep and goats in critical habitat at state
expense because Act expressly abrogates sovereign immunity under Eleventh
Amendment.  471 F. Supp. 985.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Actions for injunctive and declaratory relief against state
officials acting in their official capacity are not barred by Eleventh
Amendment.  481 F. Supp. 1028.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State waived immunity by voluntarily coming into federal
court when state courts also had jurisdiction.  531 F. Supp. 517.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State sovereign immunity does not bar an action when
official's actions violated the Constitution.  751 F. Supp. 1401.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Bars inmate's claim for damages against state prison
officials in their official capacities.  807 F. Supp. 1505.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State defendants motion for summary judgment granted on all
claims against state officials in their official capacities, where Eleventh
Amendment barred state law claims and plaintiffs sought only retrospective
relief against the state officials.  824 F. Supp. 1480.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State had not waived its sovereign immunity, thus,
plaintiffs claims against State or its agencies or departments were barred by
the Eleventh Amendment.  824 F. Supp. 1480.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. §1983 claim and pendent state
law claims against State.  874 F. Supp. 1095.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred inmate's claims against State and defendants in their
official capacities for alleged violations of state law and inmate's 42 U.S.C.
§1983 claims for monetary relief against State and defendants in their official
capacities.  902 F. Supp. 1220.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Inasmuch as plaintiff's claims under §378-2 against the State
were against a state government, they were barred in federal court by Eleventh
Amendment; plaintiff's claims against state officials in their official
capacities must likewise be barred.  910 F. Supp. 479.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff's claims for relief based on allegedly
unconstitutional rule of professional conduct enforced by state officials,
constituted an exception to Eleventh Amendment doctrine of sovereign immunity
under Ex Parte Young.  916 F. Supp. 1525.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C. §1983 claims for damages, where
plaintiffs sought damages on grounds that State's QUEST health care program
prior to April 1, 1996 violated equal protection clause of Fourteenth Amendment
by discriminating against the blind and disabled.  939 F. Supp. 765.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs argued that State waived its Eleventh Amendment
immunity through the enactment of §353-14 and the State's Tort Claims Act
[sic], §§662-2 and 663-1, no express consent or applicable waiver provisions
found.  940 F. Supp. 1523.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred claims against defendant state agencies, federal
constitutional claims brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against state officials in
official capacities, and state law claims.  951 F. Supp. 1484.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, where defendants
removed case to federal court and defendants raised immunity defense in their
answer in state court and not in their motion for partial judgment on
pleadings.  951 F. Supp. 1484.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sections 661-1 and 662-2 did not constitute a waiver of
defendants' Eleventh Amendment immunity; neither Native American Languages Act
of 1990 nor 42 U.S.C. §1983 abrogated the Eleventh Amendment.  951 F. Supp.
1484.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' suit barred by Eleventh Amendment and prior Ninth
Circuit authority, where, inter alia, plaintiffs asked court to compel state
defendants to spend §5(f) (Admission Act) funds on only one (Hawaiian home
lands) of the five purposes provided for in the Admission Act, in order to
compensate for past breaches of trust.  996 F. Supp. 989.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs argued that defendant was not an arm of the
State of Maryland and thus was unable to obtain protection through the Eleventh
Amendment, defendant was vested with sovereign immunity.  As there was no named
state official in the complaint or elsewhere, that was allegedly violating
plaintiffs' rights under federal law, plaintiffs' claims could not fall within
exception which allowed suits to enjoin state officials from violating federal
law.  3 F. Supp. 2d 1127.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs asserted claims against defendant based upon
Declaratory Judgment Act, and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation
Act, as provided under the Defense Base Act, absent a clear statement that
Congress intended to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity, such immunity
remained intact and protected defendant from suit in federal court.  3 F. Supp.
2d 1127.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State and department of land and natural resources immune
from suit, where plaintiff sought to enjoin State and city and county of
Honolulu from implementation or enforcement of any and all state statutes and
city ordinances that might apply to the business that plaintiff claimed to be
developing, involving a commercial boating activity on the Ala Wai canal.  57
F. Supp. 2d 1028.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred plaintiff's tort claims and claims that defendants
violated two constitutional amendments made actionable under 42 U.S.C. §1983,
made against defendants State and Hawaii paroling authority (&quot;HPA&quot;)
parole administrator and HPA chairman in their official capacities.  109 F.
Supp. 2d 1262.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendants removed action to federal court, defendant
State had not waived sovereign immunity; Eleventh Amendment barred plaintiff's
claims against State and defendant-physicians in their official capacities. 
109 F. Supp. 2d 1271.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff's claims dismissed, on Eleventh Amendment immunity
grounds, to extent they were asserted against defendants in their official
capacities.  110 F. Supp. 2d 1312.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' motion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment
immunity denied as to plaintiffs' claims against the State based on §504 of the
Rehabilitation Act.  141 F. Supp. 2d 1243.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  On and after July 1, 1998, the date §304-6 [as amended] took
effect, the University of Hawaii continued to be an arm of the State for
purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  159 F. Supp. 2d 1211.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' motion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment
immunity denied as to plaintiffs' claim under §504 of the Rehabilitation Act. 
165 F. Supp. 2d 1144.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No Eleventh Amendment immunity for county in lawsuit based on
county planning commission's denial of a special use permit sought under
§205-6.  229 F. Supp. 2d 1056.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  City and county had no Eleventh Amendment immunity, where
city and county had not demonstrated that any judgment issued against it in the
case would be a judgment against the State.  307 F. Supp. 2d 1149.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings and
summary judgment as to Eleventh Amendment immunity (1) denied regarding claims
under §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, where State waived its Eleventh Amendment
immunity as to §504 by accepting federal funding; and (2) granted regarding 42
U.S.C. §1983 and state law claims against defendants in their official
capacities and defendants state agency and agency program.  351 F. Supp. 2d
998.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Barred federal law claims against department of education
(DOE) and against a defendant in the defendant's official capacity to the
extent that plaintiff sought damages; did not bar federal law claims for
prospective relief against the defendant in defendant's official capacity;
barred state law claims against both DOE and the defendant in defendant's
official capacity, regardless of the relief sought.  396 F. Supp. 2d 1138.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Court declined to dismiss plaintiff's claim asserting
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the portion of the claim
asserting a violation of the federal Constitution, as against the State, to the
extent that plaintiff sought prospective relief, where, inter alia, plaintiff
sought reinstatement as a teacher.  Where the State had not consented to be
sued for the state claims in federal court, the State was immune from the
claims and the claims were dismissed.  405 F. Supp. 2d 1225.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Requested relief that trust status of exchanged lands be
restored by constructive trust is equivalent to nullification of the exchange
and return of exchanged lands to trust res; as such, relief seeks compensation
for past actions of state officials and is barred by State's sovereign
immunity.  73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellants' claims not barred by sovereign immunity where
appellants' requested relief not a request for compensation for past action of
Hawaiian homes commission members.  81 H. 474, 918 P.2d 1130.</p>
