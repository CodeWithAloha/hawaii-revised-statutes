subsection shall be construed to entitle persons appointed and commissioned by
the director to retirement benefits applicable to police officers under chapter

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  The director may adopt, amend, or repeal
rules pursuant to chapter 91 to effectuate the purposes of all laws within the
jurisdiction of the department of commerce and consumer affairs.  The

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (l)  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding,
the director of commerce and consumer affairs may:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Establish, increase, decrease, or repeal fees

basis.  The fees charged for the copies or access may include billing service
fees, network usage fees, and computer consultant fees.  In adopting these
fees, the director shall take into account the intent to make the division
self-supporting.  To this end, the fees may reflect the commercial value of the
service or information provided.  In the case of requests for records by a
nonprofit organization, the director may reduce or waive the fees.  This paragraph
shall control in any instance where there is a conflict between this paragraph
and any other statute; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Assess fees for copies of consumer and business
educational publications prepared or issued by the department.  Fees collected
under this paragraph shall be deposited into the compliance resolution fund

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (m)  Notwithstanding section 92-17 or any other
law to the contrary, all boards, commissions, and regulatory programs placed
within the department of commerce and consumer affairs for administrative
purposes shall delegate their authority to receive, arbitrate, investigate, and
prosecute complaints to the department.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (n)  Each board and commission, as well as the
director, by written order, may delegate to the executive secretary or other
personnel of the department any of its powers or duties as it deems reasonable
and proper for the administration of the licensing laws that are within the
jurisdiction of the department of commerce and consumer affairs.  The delegated
powers and duties may be exercised by the executive secretary or other
personnel of the department in the name of the board, commission, or the
director.  However, neither a board, a commission, nor the director shall
delegate the authority to adopt, amend, or repeal rules or take final
disciplinary action against a licensee.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (o)  Every person licensed under any chapter
within the jurisdiction of the department of commerce and consumer affairs and
every person licensed subject to chapter 485A or registered under chapter 467B
shall pay upon issuance of a license, permit, certificate, or registration a
fee and a subsequent annual fee to be determined by the director and adjusted
from time to time to ensure that the proceeds, together with all other fines,
income, and penalties collected under this section, do not surpass the annual
operating costs of conducting compliance resolution activities required under
this section.  The fees may be collected biennially or pursuant to rules
adopted under chapter 91, and shall be deposited into the special fund
established under this subsection.  Every filing pursuant to chapter 514E or
section 485A-202(a)(26) shall be assessed, upon initial filing and at each
renewal period in which a renewal is required, a fee that shall be prescribed
by rules adopted under chapter 91, and that shall be deposited into the special
fund established under this subsection.  Any unpaid fee shall be paid by the licensed
person, upon application for renewal, restoration, reactivation, or
reinstatement of a license, and by the person responsible for the renewal,
restoration, reactivation, or reinstatement of a license, upon the application
for renewal, restoration, reactivation, or reinstatement of the license.  If
the fees are not paid, the director may deny renewal, restoration,
reactivation, or reinstatement of the license.  The director may establish,
increase, decrease, or repeal the fees when necessary pursuant to rules adopted
under chapter 91.  The director may also increase or decrease the fees pursuant
to section 92-28.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     There is created in the state treasury a
special fund to be known as the compliance resolution fund to be expended by
the director's designated representatives as provided by this subsection. 
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, all revenues, fees, and fines
collected by the department shall be deposited into the compliance resolution
fund.  Unencumbered balances existing on June 30, 1999, in the cable television
fund under chapter 440G, the division of consumer advocacy fund under chapter
269, the financial institution examiners' revolving fund, section 412:2-109,
the special handling fund, section 414-13, and unencumbered balances existing
on June 30, 2002, in the insurance regulation fund, section 431:2-215, shall be
deposited into the compliance resolution fund.  This provision shall not apply
to the drivers education fund underwriters fee, section 431:10C-115, insurance
premium taxes and revenues, revenues of the workers' compensation special
compensation fund, section 386-151, the captive insurance administrative fund,
section 431:19-101.8, the insurance commissioner's education and training fund,
section 431:2-214, the medical malpractice patients' compensation fund as

education fund, section 444-29, the condominium management education fund,
section 514A-131, and the condominium education trust fund, section 514B-71. 
Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, the director may use the moneys in the
fund to employ, without regard to chapter 76, hearings officers and attorneys. 
All other employees may be employed in accordance with chapter 76.  Any law to
the contrary notwithstanding, the moneys in the fund shall be used to fund the
operations of the department.  The moneys in the fund may be used to train
personnel as the director deems necessary and for any other activity related to
compliance resolution.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     As used in this subsection, unless otherwise
required by the context, &quot;compliance resolution&quot; means a
determination of whether:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Any licensee or applicant under any chapter
subject to the jurisdiction of the department of commerce and consumer affairs
has complied with that chapter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Any person subject to chapter 485A has complied
with that chapter;</p>

section 485A-202(a)(26);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Any person has complied with the prohibitions
against unfair and deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Any person subject to chapter 467B has complied
with that chapter;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>and includes work involved in or supporting the
above functions, licensing, or registration of individuals or companies
regulated by the department, consumer protection, and other activities of the
department.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The director shall prepare and submit an annual
report to the governor and the legislature on the use of the compliance
resolution fund.  The report shall describe expenditures made from the fund
including non-payroll operating expenses.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (p)  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding,
the department of commerce and consumer affairs, or any board or commission
placed within it for administrative purposes, may contract with professional
testing services to prepare, administer, and grade examinations and tests for
license applicants.  For these purposes, the department may require applicants
to pay the examination fee directly to the testing agency.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (q)  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding,
