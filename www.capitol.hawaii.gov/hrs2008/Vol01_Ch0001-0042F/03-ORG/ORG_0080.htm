<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §80.  Appointment, removal, tenure, and
salaries of officers.</b>  The President shall nominate and, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, appoint the chief justice and justices of the
supreme court, who shall hold office for the term of seven years unless sooner
removed by the President, and the judges of the circuit courts who shall hold
office for the term of six years, unless sooner removed by the President; and
the governor shall nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the
senate of the Territory of Hawaii, appoint the attorney-general, treasurer,
commissioner of public lands, commissioner of agriculture and forestry,
superintendent of public works, superintendent of public instruction, auditor,
deputy auditor, surveyor, high sheriff, members of the board of health,
commissioners of public instruction, board of prison inspectors, board of
registration and inspectors of election, and any other boards of a public
character that may be created by law, except for the board of trustee of the
employees' retirement system; and he may make such appointments when the senate
is not in session by granting commissions, which shall, unless such
appointments are confirmed, expire at the end of the next session of the
senate.  He may, by and with the advice and consent of the senate of the
Territory of Hawaii, remove from office any of such officers.  All such
officers shall hold office for four years and until their successors are
appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed, except the commissioners of
public instruction and the members of said boards, whose term of office shall
be as provided by the laws of the Territory of Hawaii.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The manner of appointment of members of the
board of trustees of the employees' retirement system shall be as provided for
by section 6<b>-</b>61, Revised Laws of Hawaii, 1955.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The manner of appointment and removal and the
tenure of all other officers shall be as provided by law; and the governor may
appoint or remove any officer whose appointment or removal is not otherwise
provided for.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The salaries of all officers other than those
appointed by the President shall be as provided by the legislature, but those
of the chief justice and the justices of the supreme court and judges of the
circuit courts shall not be diminished during their term of office.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     All officers appointed under the provisions of
this section shall be citizens of the Territory of Hawaii and shall have
resided therein for at least three years next preceding their appointment.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     All persons holding office in the Hawaiian
Islands at the time this Act takes effect shall continue to hold their
respective offices until their successors are appointed and qualified, but not
beyond the end of the first session of the senate of the Territory of Hawaii
unless reappointed as herein provided.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Provided, however, That nothing in this section
shall be construed to conflict with the authority and powers conferred by
section fifty-six of this Act as herein amended. [Am March&nbsp;3, 1905, c
1465, §2, 33 Stat 1035; July&nbsp;9, 1921, c 42, §312, 42 Stat 119; May&nbsp;9,
1956, c 237, §1, 70 Stat 130; Aug.&nbsp;28, 1958, Pub L 85-793, 72 Stat 957]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appointive power, 34 H. 12.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The governor cannot suspend an officer appointable and
removable by him with the consent of the senate and whose term of office is
four years, unless sooner removed:  15 H. 114.  A board of medical examiners
appointed by the treasurer under the Hawaiian statute and not by the governor
with the consent of the senate under this §, was held to be at least a de facto
board.  15 H. 273.  The validity of an income tax law cannot be attacked by one
not affected thereby on the ground that it would effect a diminution of judges'
salaries contrary to the provisions of this §:  13 H. 594; 121 Fed. 772.  The
words &quot;and until their successors are appointed and qualified&quot; apply
to officers appointed by the President as well as to those appointed by the
governor under this §:  42 C. Cls. R. 54.  This § does not invalidate a
territorial statute authorizing the chief justice to designate a circuit judge
of one circuit to sit in place of a circuit judge of another circuit who is
absent, disqualified:  26 H. 557, 290 Fed. 146.  This § is controlled by §56,
which authorizes the appointment and election of officers of municipal
corporations in other ways:  16 H. 779.  Salaries of members of supreme court,
not taxable:  25 H. 607.  But see 307 U.S. 277.  Referred to in 14 H. 222, 283;
15 H. 298, 366, 367; 16 H. 245; 23 Ops. 138.  On appointment of members of
supreme court, see also §82.</p>
