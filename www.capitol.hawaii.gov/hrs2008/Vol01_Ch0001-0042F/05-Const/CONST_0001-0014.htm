prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by
an impartial jury of the district wherein the crime shall have been committed,
which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, or of such other
district to which the prosecution may be removed with the consent of the
accused; to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section modeled after the 6th Amendment of the federal
constitution and was intended to incorporate it and to give the State the
benefit of federal decisions  construing the same language.  47 H. 361, 385,
389 P.2d 439.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Compulsory process.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant only afforded right to compel attendance and
testimony of witnesses who can give relevant and beneficial testimony for
defense.  64 H. 217, 638 P.2d 324; 67 H. 59, 677 P.2d 465.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Evidence did not show that testimony would have been relevant
and beneficial to defense.  64 H. 217, 638 P.2d 324.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated by prohibition of witnesses' description testimony,
though their identification testimony suppressed.  67 H. 123, 680 P.2d 253.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  To protect the right to testify under Hawai'i constitution,
trial courts must advise criminal defendants of their right to testify and must
obtain on-the-record waiver of that right in every case in which the defendant
does not testify.  79 H. 226, 900 P.2d 1293.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A trial court must pass on a defendant's attempted withdrawal
of the prior waiver of his or her right to testify, tendered before the
commencement of closing arguments, pursuant to the &quot;liberal
approach&quot;, whereas such an attempted withdrawal tendered thereafter is
subject to the &quot;manifest injustice&quot; standard.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d
239.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant did not meet burden of establishing plausible
and legitimate reasons for withdrawal of defendant's prior waiver of
defendant's right to testify, defendant failed to present &quot;fair and just reasons&quot;
for defendant's request to exercise defendant's right to testify in defendant's
own behalf; thus trial court did not abuse discretion by ruling that it would
not reopen case.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court's denial of defendant's post-verdict motion
for a new trial--based on defendant's claim that defendant's attempt to
withdraw defendant's waiver of right to testify in defendant's own behalf
should have been allowed--was not &quot;manifestly unjust&quot;, no abuse of
discretion.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right to testify violated where trial court
failed to establish on the record that defendant's decision not to testify was
made knowingly and voluntarily.  91 H. 275, 982 P.2d 904.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Tachibana colloquy to advise a defendant that he or she
has a right not to testify is required only in cases in which the defendant
does not testify; it is not required in a situation where the defendant has
decided to testify.  94 H. 292, 12 P.3d 1233.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  To minimize the scope of any post-conviction claim by a
testifying defendant that he or she was not aware of his or her right to
testify, trial court must give prior-to-start-of-trial advisement informing
defendant of his or her right to testify or not to testify, and that if
defendant has not testified by the end of trial, the court will briefly
question defendant to ensure that the decision not to testify was defendant's
own decision.  94 H. 292, 12 P.3d 1233.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where witness appeared, exercised witness' right to remain
silent, and defendant failed to offer proof beyond conjecture that witness'
testimony would be helpful to defendant, defendant's right not violated.  100
H. 210, 58 P.3d 1257.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by trial court's refusal to allow further
examination of witness.  5 H. App. 127, 681 P.2d 573.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's constitutional and statutory right to testify in
defendant's own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow
defendant's attorney's advice and thus refrain from testifying, and the
violation was plain error; denial of the right to testify was prejudicial and
not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court's failure to obtain on-the-record waivers from
co-defendants of their right to testify was not harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt where, if co-defendants' testimony had been added to version of events,
jury's decision may have been different.  92 H. 148 (App.), 988 P.2d 667.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court violated defendant's right to testify by
failing to advise defendant of that right and obtain a waiver on the record,
and it could not be said beyond a reasonable doubt that if defendant's
testimony had been added to the eyewitness' version of the incident, the
verdict would not have been different, trial court's error not harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt.  93 H. 513 (App.), 6 P.3d 385.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As right to testify is personal to defendant, to be
relinquished only by defendant, court erred in failing to obtain waiver of
right directly from defendant; defense counsel's remark that &quot;he has
elected not to testify&quot; did not constitute a voluntary and knowing waiver
by defendant of that right. 94 H. 271 (App.), 12 P.3d 371.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where decisive issue in case was credibility, and there was
extensive contradiction between State's witnesses and defendant's witness, a
reasonable possibility existed that violation of defendant's right to testify
contributed to defendant's conviction; court's error was thus not harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt and defendant's conviction and sentence had to be
vacated. 94 H. 271 (App.), 12 P.3d 371.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Failure to advise defendant who testified that defendant had
a right not to testify during trial was harmless error, rather than plain
error.  94 H. 309 (App.), 12 P.3d 1250.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Confrontation of witnesses.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  See also notes to U.S. Const. Amend. 6.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Compulsory process provision construed; witness violating
order excluding witnesses from courtroom should still be allowed to testify to
guarantee to accused his constitutional right.  51 H. 581, 465 P.2d 560.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation where the State made a good faith effort to
locate witness.  70 H. 343, 771 P.2d 509.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation where witness is unavailable and former
testimony is used.  71 H. 274, 789 P.2d 497.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Lower court's failure to issue bench warrant for complaining
witness in family abuse case, and denial of motion for dismissal without
prejudice, violated appellant's right to confrontation.  72 H. 469, 822 P.2d
519.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Criminal defendant's right to be present at all stages of
trial cannot be waived by counsel.  73 H. 97, 828 P.2d 280.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Error for trial court to refuse to permit a defense witness
to testify as penalty for violating witness exclusion rule.  73 H. 331, 832
P.2d 269.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not violated by defendant's absence from conference
settling jury instructions as conference does not involve jury's presence or
witness testimony.  74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellant's right violated; trial court improperly admitted
witness' testimony under excited utterance exception to hearsay rule where
prosecution failed to issue trial subpoena to declarant and failed to make
showing of declarant's unavailability.  74 H. 343, 845 P.2d 547.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Admission of co-defendant's testimony concerning
incriminatory out-of-court statements made against defendant did not violate
defendant's rights to confront defendant's accuser under the U.S. or Hawai'i
Constitutions.  76 H. 148, 871 P.2d 782.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Circuit court's limitation of appellant's cross-examination
of witness did not violate appellant's right to confront witnesses against
appellant where appellant adequately raised issue of witness' possible bias. 
78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right of confrontation under this section was
violated by the admission of complainant's videotaped interview in lieu of
direct examination.  79 H. 128, 900 P.2d 135.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Prior to introduction of videotaped interview,
cross-examination of complainant sex assault victim regarding complainant's
conversation with police officer satisfied defendant's right of confrontation. 
80 H. 107, 905 P.2d 613.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by admission of declarant's former testimony
under HRE rule 804(b)(1) where prosecution established declarant's
unavailability, that it had made good faith efforts to secure declarant's
presence, and reliability of statement was shown.  82 H. 202, 921 P.2d 122.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Abuse of discretion where trial court excluded evidence of
complainant's prior conviction, by prohibiting cross-examination of
complainant, from which jury could have inferred that complainant had a motive
to bring false charges against defendant and give false testimony at trial.  83
H. 109, 924 P.2d 1215.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right violated as prosecution witness not
&quot;unavailable&quot; under HRE rule 804(a)(5); prosecution's good faith
efforts require a search equally as vigorous as that which it would undertake
to find a critical witness if it had no prior testimony to rely upon in the
event of unavailability.  83 H. 267, 925 P.2d 1091.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not violated where trial court allowed defense adequate
opportunity to raise issue of witness' possible bias while imposing modest
restriction on defense's cross-examination of witness to avoid risk of
prejudicing jury.  83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Admission into evidence of witness' grand jury testimony
under HRE rule 802.1(4), past recollection recorded hearsay exception, did not
violate defendant's right where witness' testimony was supported by numerous
guarantees of trustworthiness, and defendant was able to cross-examine witness
on witness' subsequent failure to remember alleged incident.  92 H. 61, 987
P.2d 959.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Admission into evidence of witness' handwritten statement on
the bottom of an identification form, under HRE rule 802.1(4), past
recollection recorded hearsay exception, did not violate defendant's right
where witness' statement was supported by numerous guarantees of
trustworthiness.  92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not violated by trial court's imposition of certain
restrictions on scope of defense counsel's cross-examination  where (1) there
was no reasonable possibility that the cross-examination would have changed the
outcome of defendant's trial; (2) witness' second forgery conviction on recross
examination was beyond the scope of redirect examination; and (3) defense
counsel's inquiring into the location of a map given to witness by defendant
was not relevant.  99 H. 390, 56 P.3d 692.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When a statutory privilege interferes with a defendant's
constitutional right to cross-examine, then, upon a sufficient showing by the
defendant, the witness' statutory privilege must, in the interest of the
truth-seeking process, bow to the defendant's constitutional rights.  101 H.
172, 65 P.3d 119.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As there is no exception under HRE rule 804(b)(8) for pending
or anticipated litigation, such that statements by victim-wife would have been
admissible even if a divorce proceeding had actually been underway, trial court
did not abuse discretion in determining hearsay statements were trustworthy;
however, trial court abused discretion in admitting statements in violation of
defendant's constitutional right to confront and cross-examine adverse
witnesses.  103 H. 89, 79 P.3d 1263.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court prohibited all inquiry into the
complainant's alleged motive or bias for faking injury, petitioner's right of
confrontation under the Sixth Amendment and this section was violated;
appellate court erred and case remanded for new trial.  106 H. 116, 102 P.3d
360.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right of confrontation was not violated by trial
court's admission of girlfriend's statement to officer as Hawaii's
confrontation clause, like its federal  counterpart, is not implicated where
the hearsay declarant attends trial and is cross-examined about his or her
prior out-of-court statement.  115 H. 503, 168 P.3d 955.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated in DUI case by admission into evidence of log
showing breath-testing instrument had been tested for accuracy.  9 H. App. 130,
828 P.2d 813.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Admission into evidence of redacted confessions of
defendants-spouses violated defendants-spouses' confrontational rights.  10 H.
App. 43, 861 P.2d 24.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's confrontation rights were not violated by
admission of &quot;hearsay&quot; statements.  79 H. 175 (App.), 900 P.2d 172.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant entitled to elicit evidence of complainant's past
sexual behavior, not to attack complainant's character, but to determine
whether complainant was mentally defective and whether defendant knew that
complainant was mentally defective.  81 H. 447 (App.), 918 P.2d 254.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by complainant's failure to testify at trial
because complainant's statements were not hearsay and actual truth or falsity
of statements were irrelevant to defendant's conviction for violating warning
citation under §709-906.  82 H. 381 (App.), 922 P.2d 994.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Clause not violated where questions defendant wanted to ask
police officer regarding officer's &quot;motive&quot; and &quot;knowledge of
how much cocaine a drug addict would consume&quot; were not relevant to any
issue in case.  82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d 916.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court erred by not allowing defendant to introduce
evidence of, and cross-examine victim as to victim's drug use and addiction at
or near the time of the incident to the extent that it affected victim's
perception or recollection of the alleged event, and defendant was not required
to present expert testimony to that effect.  108 H. 102 (App.), 117 P.3d 834.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where, even in the absence of a plea agreement, witness'
pending sentencing in two other criminal matters were relevant and probative of
a potential bias or motive for testifying in favor of the State, trial court
erred in denying defendant's motion in limine with respect to evidence of
witness' pending sentencing, and error was not harmful beyond a reasonable
doubt as State's case was based on jury finding that witness' testimony was
credible and believing the witness over the defendant.  108 H. 102 (App.), 117
P.3d 834.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Right to counsel.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  See also notes to U.S. Const. Amend. 6.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Applied.  56 H. 23, 525 P.2d 1108.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There is no right to counsel at a post-arrest photographic
display.  59 H. 167, 578 P.2d 236.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Effective assistance of counsel.  64 H. 62, 636 P.2d 742.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Effective assistance of counsel denied where defense counsel
caused introduction of highly prejudicial and otherwise inadmissible evidence. 
68 H. 304, 712 P.2d 496.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated where questioning continued after right invoked; use
of defendant's unsuppressed statements not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
69 H. 51, 731 P.2d 1264.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated by introduction of evidence that defendant invoked
right, where whether defendant had done so not at issue.  69 H. 68, 733 P.2d
690.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Claim that failure to call expert witnesses to rebut State's
DNA profiling evidence introduced at motion in limine constituted ineffective
assistance of counsel was meritless.  73 H. 130, 828 P.2d 1274.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise contention
that defendant had not waived right to be present at trial where defendant had
voluntarily absented oneself after trial had begun.  73 H. 147, 828 P.2d 281.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant has burden to establish ineffective assistance of
counsel and meet two-part test; under Hawaii Constitution, defendant afforded
greater protection of right to effective assistance of counsel than under U.S.
Constitution.  74 H. 54, 837 P.2d 1298.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No denial of effective assistance of counsel where counsel
waived defendant's presence at conference settling jury instructions, withdrew
insanity defense, and failed to object to examiner's testimony.  74 H. 141, 838
P.2d 1374.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where petitioner's convictions on counts I (attempted first
degree murder), II (second degree murder), and III (attempted second degree
murder) violated §701-109(1)(c)'s clear prohibition against inconsistent
factual findings, the failure to raise this issue, both at trial and on appeal,
resulted in withdrawal of not only a potentially meritorious defense, but a
defense that would have altered the outcome.  74 H. 442, 848 P.2d 966.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Post-conviction ineffective assistance of counsel HRPP rule
40 petition not prejudiced where defendant alleges facts that, if proven, would
entitle defendant to relief and claim is not patently frivolous and without
trace of support in the record.  75 H. 419, 864 P.2d 583.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial counsel's alleged errors did not constitute ineffective
assistance of counsel where defendant argued, inter alia, that trial counsel
should have obtained expert analysis of white powder defendant provided to
undercover police officer to determine how much &quot;pure&quot; cocaine it
contained; rejection of defendant's claim that trial counsel's failure to
interview and subpoena defendant's girlfriend amounted to ineffective
assistance was without prejudice to a subsequent HRPP rule 40 petition.  77 H.
72, 881 P.2d 1218.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of right to counsel
where, inter alia, defendant persistently refused legal assistance despite
court's repeated invitation and amply demonstrated capacity to proceed pro se. 
81 H. 198, 915 P.2d 672.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No ineffective assistance of counsel where defense counsel's
failure to object to prosecution witnesses' testimony did not result in the
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a meritorious defense.  81 H. 293, 916
P.2d 703.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where attorney-client privilege was not applicable to
communications because they were not &quot;confidential&quot; but
&quot;voluntarily disclosed&quot; in known presence of third party who was
neither co-defendant nor representative of the client or of the lawyer and in a
place accessible to the general public, right to effective assistance not
violated.  84 H. 229, 933 P.2d 66.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A defense counsel's representation is constitutionally
ineffective under the Hawaii constitution if:  (1) a relationship giving rise
to a conflict of interest existed between defense counsel and his/her clients;
and (2) either the relationship adversely affected defense counsel's
performance, or the client did not consent to the relationship.  88 H. 19, 960
P.2d 1227.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No ineffective assistance of counsel based on various
grounds, including conflict of interest and failure of counsel to: file
pre-trial motion to dismiss indictment based on insufficient evidence;
investigate and obtain testimony of witnesses; call certain witnesses; object
to admission of certain evidence; and challenge selection of jurors or
composition of jury.  88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant could have challenged the validity of the
search warrant if given a range of dates of the observations by prosecution's
confidential informant and defendant's attorney could file the appropriate
pre-trial motions and prepare for trial without the exact dates, right to
effective assistance of counsel not violated by defendant not knowing the exact
dates of the observations.  88 H. 396, 967 P.2d 228.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right to assistance of counsel and to present a defense not
violated by trial court's refusal to allow defendant to present oral argument
on motion for judgment of acquittal; no constitutional right to argue a motion
for judgment of acquittal.  91 H. 288, 983 P.2d 189.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  An attorney &quot;employed and paid by the county&quot; for
the benefit of a police officer, to defend the officer in a criminal case
pursuant to §52D-8 and in related civil cases, in which the county has asserted
claims adverse to the officer, is not per se, by virtue of such employment and
payment, deemed ineffective counsel.  95 H. 9, 18 P.3d 871.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant was entitled to a hearing on question of whether
counsel who filed motion to withdraw guilty plea should have been substituted
as counsel of record before trial court summarily denied defendant's motion on
the ground that a withdrawal and substitution of counsel had not been filed
under rule 57, HRPP.  95 H. 177, 19 P.3d 1289.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's trial counsel provided defendant with ineffective
assistance in failing to seek suppression of defendant's confession on the
ground that defendant's inculpatory statement was induced by detective's use of
evidence that detective had obtained as a result of executing an unlawful
search warrant.  98 H. 387, 49 P.3d 353.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Ineffective assistance of counsel when defense counsel's
errors and omissions resulted in the possible impairment of a potentially
meritorious defense; defense counsel failed to object to prosecution's rebuttal
argument commenting on defendant's failure to testify and counsel intentionally
elicited detective's opinion that defendant had murdered defendant's wife.  102
H. 504, 78 P.3d 317.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated where imprisonment authorized but not imposed. 
3 H. App. 673, 657 P.2d 1062.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No showing of knowing and intelligent waiver; infringement of
right presumed prejudicial and State must rebut presumption and prove error was
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  4 H. App. 614, 672 P.2d 1036.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Standard for effective assistance of appellate counsel; right
not violated.  6 H. App. 331, 720 P.2d 1015.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No right to hybrid representation.  8 H. App. 330, 802 P.2d
482.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where an accused has been arrested and interrogated by police
and has not been specifically advised by court or accused's counsel that
accused has constitutional right to counsel at every stage of proceeding
following that arrest, accused cannot be held to have knowingly and
intelligently waived that right, and any statements made by accused to police
absent the advice are inadmissible.  9 H. App. 447, 845 P.2d 1194.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant contended that defendant was denied
constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at trial because
defendant's trial counsel, deputy public defender, concurrently represented
defendant's brother in another criminal case and defendant's defense at trial
was that brother was the actual perpetrator of offenses for which defendant was
convicted, case remanded for evidentiary hearing to determine whether conflict
of interest actually existed when trial counsel represented defendant and, if
so, whether the conflict prejudiced defendant's right.  77 H. 374 (App.), 884
P.2d 1150.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The court's assumption of defense counsel's role by
persuading defendant to relinquish defendant's right to testify was an
interference with the attorney-client relationship protected by Sixth Amendment
to U.S. Constitution and this section; the intervention by the court
constituted plain error; the error was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Indigent defendant charged with offense punishable by term of
imprisonment entitled at trial to be assisted by appointed counsel.  80 H. 246
(App.), 909 P.2d 574.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant did not waive right to court-appointed counsel
where defendant requested substitute court-appointed counsel and was not
afforded reasonable opportunity to show good cause for a substitute
court-appointed counsel.  80 H. 262 (App.), 909 P.2d 590.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Absent valid waiver of right, use of prior uncounseled felony
convictions to enhance prison sentence violates defendant's right to counsel. 
81 H. 421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  If sentencing court gives consideration to defendant's
previous convictions in choosing to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment,
court must ensure that any prior felony, misdemeanor, and petty misdemeanor
conviction relied on was with defendant receiving assistance of counsel.  81 H.
421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel's failure
to request trial continuance when police officer was unavailable to testify at
trial did not result in prejudice to defendant.  82 H. 394 (App.), 922 P.2d
1007.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No ineffective assistance where, inter alia, defendant's
counsel adequately prepared for trial, did not fail to offer motion to sever
trials, and no evidence that fact that defendant's counsel was not lead counsel
was prejudicial to defendant's entrapment defense.  82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d
916.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not violated by trial court's denial of defendant's
motion to withdraw and substitute counsel as there was no good cause to warrant
substitution where, despite being advised of its inadmissible nature, defendant
insisted attorney proffer character evidence and character witnesses at trial,
there was no &quot;complete breakdown of trust and confidence&quot; between
attorney and defendant, and defendant elected to continue with attorney,
without further protest, and did not aver that defendant wanted to go to trial
pro se.  101 H. 112 (App.), 63 P.3d 420.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant had not been charged with any crime when
defendant gave defendant's statement, defendant's right not violated.  101 H.
344 (App.), 68 P.3d 618.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Ineffective assistance of counsel where public defender (PD)
mistakenly concluded that HRPP rule 16 required PD to turn over defendant's
toxicology report to the State and failed to realize that by doing so, PD was
waiving defendant's physician-patient privilege, and PD's errors substantially
impaired defendant's potentially meritorious defense as evidence that defendant
tested positive for cocaine undermined the credibility of the defendant.  107
H. 282 (App.), 112 P.3d 768.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where record showed that trial court judge was
extraordinarily patient and accommodating with defense counsel and that if
defense counsel had wanted to make a closing argument, the judge would not have
denied that request, defendant waived defendant's right to make a closing
argument and court's failure to affirmatively offer defendant's counsel the
opportunity to present a closing argument at trial did not deprive defendant of
right to present a closing argument.  110 H. 284 (App.), 132 P.3d 852.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Self-representation.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right of self-representation is guaranteed by this section. 
Mere appointment of standby counsel over a defendant's objection does not per
se violate this section; the level of standby counsel's participation
determines whether a defendant's constitutional right of self-representation
has been violated. 75 H. 307, 861 P.2d 11.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Jury of the district.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section modeled after 6th Amendment of federal constitution. 
51 H. 612, 466 P.2d 422.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Driving under influence is serious crime entitling accused
persons right to jury trial; statutory amendment limiting incarceration periods
did not reduce seriousness of crime.  72 H. 597, 825 P.2d 1065.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Waiver of right to jury trial cannot be presumed by silent
record.  73 H. 217, 830 P.2d 512.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant charged with driving after license suspended for
driving under influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of §291-4.5 (1985),
not entitled to jury trial.  75 H. 68, 856 P.2d 1240.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because the record was silent as to any colloquy between
court and defendant, counsel's waiver of client's right was invalid, violating
defendant's right to trial by jury under this section and Sixth Amendment to
U.S. Constitution.  75 H. 118, 857 P.2d 576.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Charge of first-offense DUI under §291-4, as amended by Act
128, L 1993 was constitutionally petty; being a constitutionally petty offense,
no right to a jury trial attached to first-offense DUI. 76 H. 360, 878 P.2d
699.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant did not have a right to jury trial on prostitution
charges.  77 H. 162, 883 P.2d 83.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Offense is presumptively a petty offense to which right to a
jury trial does not attach, if maximum authorized term of imprisonment for offense
does not exceed thirty days.  77 H. 162, 883 P.2d 83.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where no term of imprisonment was authorized under §266-25
for violation of administrative rule regulating boat moorings, violation a
presumptively petty offense for which right to jury trial did not attach;
consideration of other relevant factors failed to overcome presumption.  84 H.

<p class=XNotes>  Findings under §706-662(5) regarding (a) the age or
handicapped status of the victim and (b) whether &quot;such disability is known
or reasonably should be known to the defendant&quot; entail
&quot;intrinsic&quot; facts; Hawaii constitution requires these findings to be
made by the trier of fact, not the sentencing court.  91 H. 261, 982 P.2d 890.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When a fact susceptible to jury determination is a predicate
to the imposition of an enhanced sentence, the Hawaii constitution requires
that such factual determinations be made by the trier of fact.  91 H. 261, 982
P.2d 890.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under totality of facts and circumstances, defendant
knowingly and voluntarily waived right to jury trial; defendant was aware of
right, articulated to trial court the difference between a jury trial and judge
trial, defendant's counsel stated counsel had explained difference to
defendant, and defendant affirmatively indicated to trial court that waiver was
voluntary and a result of defendant's own reflection.  93 H. 63, 996 P.2d 268.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There is no constitutional right to a jury trial for a
first-time driving under the influence of drugs offense under §291-7 (1993) as
the offense is a &quot;petty&quot; and not &quot;serious&quot; offense.  97 H.
259, 36 P.3d 803.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where record indicated that trial court conducted a colloquy
with defendant regarding defendant's right to a trial by jury and that
defendant orally waived this right, defendant subsequently failed to overcome burden
of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant's waiver of right
to jury trial was involuntary.  99 H. 312, 55 P.3d 276.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant must personally give oral or written waiver of
right to jury trial; waiver by defense counsel not valid in absence of any
colloquy between court and defendant.  80 H. 372 (App.), 910 P.2d 143.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not erroneously denied where plaintiff missed ten-day
jury demand deadline under DCRCP rule 38(b) without adequate excuse.  83 H. 50
(App.), 924 P.2d 544.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial judge failed to engage in a colloquy with
defendant to ensure that the waiver of jury trial was intelligent, knowing and
voluntary, and defendant's counsel did not represent in open court that
defendant was aware of defendant's right to a jury trial, under the totality of
circumstances, trial court failed to obtain a valid waiver of defendant's right
to a jury trial.  98 H. 77 (App.), 42 P.3d 654.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the totality of the circumstances, where defendant's
express waiver of a jury trial was consistently clear, direct, and unequivocal
throughout the entire colloquy, defendant orally waived right to trial by jury,
and failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that this  waiver
was involuntary.  105 H. 160 (App.), 95 P.3d 14.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where maximum time in jail for a violation of a Hawaii
administrative rule was thirty days and notwithstanding that defendant was
subject to a possible maximum fine of $18,000, defendant's offense was
&quot;petty&quot;; thus, defendant had no right to a jury trial under the
Hawaii constitution.  105 H. 342 (App.), 97 P.3d 418.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Based on the totality of the circumstances, defendant failed
to establish that the waiver of defendant's right to a jury trial was
involuntary or improper; the family court's mass advisement, in conjunction
with the family court's individualized colloquy of defendant, sufficiently
apprised defendant of defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial, and
defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived this right.  108 H.
300 (App.), 119 P.3d 608.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial
for a violation of §852-1, refusal to provide ingress or egress while walking a
labor picket line, where the maximum punishment was thirty days in jail or a
$200 fine, or both, and violation was thus a petty misdemeanor under
§701-107(4).  110 H. 139 (App.), 129 P.3d 1167.§</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Public trial.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Manner in which defendant's family was excluded from
courtroom violated defendant's right to a public trial.  91 H. 181, 981 P.2d
1127.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The right to a public trial is not implicated by the
exclusion of a potential witness pursuant to the witness exclusionary rule;
both the witness exclusionary rule and the right to a public trial ensure the
appearance of fairness at trial; thus, defendant's right not violated by
exclusion of defendant's father from the courtroom as a potential prosecution
rebuttal  witness.  97 H. 206, 35 P.3d 233.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's constitutional rights to a public trial were not
implicated when the jury was allowed to deliberate, communicate, and return its
verdict after normal business hours, when the courthouse was closed to the
public, because the closure &quot;was too trivial to implicate the
constitutional guarantees&quot;.  112 H. 343 (App.), 145 P.3d 886.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right to a fair trial was violated when it was

stand.  71 H. 389, 791 P.2d 1266.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Questioning only the jury foreperson does not resolve the

<p class=XNotes>  Jury was not tainted by anonymous phone calls to some of the
jurors where no threat was made or where there was no actual reference to the

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court's supplemental instruction to deadlocked jury
that it must unanimously decide that it was unable to reach verdict was
prejudicial.  72 H. 327, 817 P.2d 1054.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Consideration of non-evidentiary materials by jury during
deliberations and failure to rebut presumption of prejudice resulted in denial
of right to fair trial.  72 H. 475, 823 P.2d 152.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court must insure that defendant's right to fair trial
is not compromised and at the least prevent or reduce prejudicial pretrial
publicity; order imposing restrictions on extrajudicial statements of trial
participants was impermissible.  73 H. 499, 835 P.2d 637.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Circuit court did not commit an abuse of discretion in
granting defendant's motion for new trial; circuit court's conclusions of law
that possible juror misconduct at voir dire and juror misconduct during
deliberations deprived defendant of a trial by twelve fair and impartial jurors
not clearly erroneous.  76 H. 172, 873 P.2d 51.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by empaneling of anonymous jury where there was
strong reason to believe jury needed protection and trial court took reasonable
steps to minimize any prejudicial effect on defendant and ensure that
defendant's fundamental rights were protected.  83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Purpose of §612-18(c) is to uphold a criminal defendant's

<p class=XNotes>  The right of an accused to a unanimous verdict in a criminal

this section and §5 of this article of the Hawaii constitution.  84 H. 1, 928
P.2d 843.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When separate and distinct culpable acts are subsumed within
a single count charging a sexual assault, the trial court must either (1)
require the prosecution to elect the specific act upon which the prosecution is
relying to establish the &quot;conduct&quot; element of the charged offense, or
(2) give the jury a specific unanimity instruction.  84 H. 1, 928 P.2d 843.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right not violated by having husband and wife
serve on same jury; both expressly stated during voir dire that they would each
make their own decisions and would not automatically go along with the other

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court failed to correct prosecution's erroneous
interpretation of &quot;remains unlawfully&quot; under §708-810, defendant's
constitutional rights to due process and a unanimous jury verdict violated.  89
H. 284, 972 P.2d 287.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court erred by ruling that evidence of
defendant's eligibility for HUD assistance was irrelevant under HRE rule 401
and thus inadmissible under rule 402 when evidence was probative of and
relevant to defendant's requisite intent, defendant's right to present a
complete defense violated.  91 H. 275, 982 P.2d 904.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  References to race that do not have an objectively legitimate
purpose constitute a particularly egregious form of prosecutorial misconduct. 
91 H. 405, 984 P.2d 1231.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was a reasonable possibility that prosecutor's
comment during closing argument might have contributed to defendant's
conviction, prosecutor's comment constituted prosecutorial misconduct that
denied defendant right to a fair trial.  91 H. 405, 984 P.2d 1231.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's constitutional right to unanimous verdict not
violated as §707-715 defines a single criminal offense; subsections (1) and (2)
constitute alternative means of establishing the mens rea of the offense of
terroristic threatening--either one giving rise to the same criminal
culpability.  92 H. 577, 994 P.2d 509.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where evidence concerned only a single incident of culpable
conduct, trial court was not required to read the jury a specific unanimity
instruction; right to unanimous verdict thus not violated.  93 H. 199, 998 P.2d
479.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Given that any improper remarks in opening statement, closing
and rebuttal arguments by prosecutor were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,
and their cumulative effect was similarly harmless and did not deprive
defendant of a fair trial, prosecutor's misconduct did not warrant reversal of
any of defendant's convictions and did not implicate the double jeopardy
clauses of either the U.S. or Hawaii Constitutions.  95 H. 465, 24 P.3d 661.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Juror questioning of witnesses did not deprive defendant of
fair and impartial trial where questions posed by jurors were carefully
reviewed by the trial court and questions tending to elicit improper or
inadmissible evidence were excluded.  97 H. 206, 35 P.3d 233.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although prosecutor's remark that the reasonable doubt
standard &quot;was never meant to provide a shield for a guilty man&quot; had
the potential to invite the jury to misapply and erode the standard, and was
thus improper, where the trial court immediately corrected the prosecutor and
issued a curative instruction, and verdicts suggested that the jury was not
unduly swayed by the isolated remark in the two week trial and gave proper consideration
to all relevant circumstances, improper comment not reversible error.  98 H. 1,
41 P.3d 157.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right not violated where defendant did not assert
or show that a &quot;distinctive group&quot; was underrepresented in the pool
of potential jurors initially selected in the case.  98 H. 1, 41 P.3d 157.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict not violated by
trial court's refusal to give a specific unanimity instruction as defendant's
actual and constructive possession of the methamphetamine comprised a
continuing course of conduct.  99 H. 198, 53 P.3d 806.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where negativing of defendant's mitigating extreme mental or
emotional distress defense by prosecution was a material element of the offense
of first degree murder such that jury unanimity was a prerequisite to returning
any verdict, and trial court's special instruction expressly directed the jury
to convict defendant of manslaughter if a single juror believed that the
prosecution had failed to negative the mitigating defense, right to unanimous
jury verdict violated.  99 H. 542, 57 P.3d 467.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The alternative states of mind potentially requisite to the
charged offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, as prescribed by the
definition of &quot;intent to defraud&quot; set forth in §708-800, does not
implicate a defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, as
guaranteed by article I, §5 and this section of the Hawaii constitution; a
proper elements instruction, which sets forth the alternative states of mind
prescribed by the &quot;intent to defraud&quot; component of second degree
theft by shoplifting, does not violate defendant's constitutional right.  101
H. 389, 69 P.3d 517.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant failed to satisfy defendant's burden of
establishing a prima facie showing that the possibility of juror misconduct
could have substantially prejudiced defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying
defendant an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion for a new trial.  103 H.
285, 81 P.3d 1200.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where, even if juror was sleeping and did not hear a portion
of defense counsel's closing argument, juror was given correct instruction, and
presumably juror followed it;  thus, based on the totality of circumstances,
the prosecution met its burden in establishing that the alleged deprivation of
the right to a fair trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  108 H. 474,
122 P.3d 254.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Failure to inquire into circumstances of statement overheard
by juror, and reliance on juror's own determination of ability to remain
impartial while unaware of influences is reversible error.  2 H. App. 643, 639
P.2d 413.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by bailiff's statement to jury foreperson that
jurors should all agree with verdict if polled.  6 H. App. 320, 721 P.2d 718.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court found statements of jurors on voir dire
credible, statements were sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that
defendant was not denied an impartial jury.  85 H. 49 (App.), 936 P.2d 1297.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where State failed to rebut presumption of prejudice to
defendant resulting from juror's improper investigation of details concerning
defendant's welfare status, court properly granted motion for new trial.  89 H.
215 (App.), 971 P.2d 304.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plain error where trial court's answer to jury communication
was prejudicially insufficient, misleading and affected defendant's
constitutional right to a unanimous verdict as jury may have wrongly believed
based on court's answer that if they failed to reach unanimous agreement as to
the affirmative defense of entrapment, the defense was not applicable and a
guilty verdict was required.  90 H. 489 (App.), 979 P.2d 85.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was a distinct and reasonable possibility that
trial court's error in commenting upon the location of the incriminating items
contributed to the conviction of the defendants, error materially impinged upon
defendant's right to trial by jury, and error was not harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt.  92 H. 675 (App.), 994 P.2d 607.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was no genuine possibility that the jurors were
not unanimous as to the conduct for which defendant was found culpable, trial
court's failure to give specific unanimity instruction as to the
methamphetamine manufacturing offense did not violate defendant's substantial
due process right to a unanimous jury verdict.  95 H. 365 (App.), 22 P.3d 1012.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where prosecutor referred to defendants' race in opening
statement, there was no curative instruction given to address the inflammatory
comment, trial court overruled defense counsel's timely objection, and the case
against defendants, which hinged on the credibility of complainant, was not so
overwhelming as to outweigh the inflammatory comment, prosecutor's references
to race might have contributed to the convictions of defendants; thus, 
convictions set aside.  98 H. 358 (App.), 48 P.3d 605.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Speedy trial.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  See also notes to U.S. Const. Amend. 6.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Factors considered in determining deprivation of speedy
trial. 64 H. 65, 637 P.2d 407.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In consenting to be tried with co-defendants, defendant could
not claim that co-defendant's motions were not attributable to defendant.  64
H. 65, 637 P.2d 407.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  One year and three week delay between arrest and trial is
presumptively prejudicial.  64 H. 65, 637 P.2d 407.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  HRPP rule 48 (dismissal) has broader purpose than
constitutional right to speedy trial.  73 H. 352, 833 P.2d 66.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant not deprived of right, where although the reason
for the delay leaned marginally in defendant's favor, the weight attributed to
that factor was offset by defendant's eleventh-hour assertion of defendant's
right and defendant's failure to even attempt to demonstrate that defendant was
actually prejudiced by the delay in the commencement of trial.  76 H. 415, 879
P.2d 520.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants not deprived of constitutional right to speedy trial
where although the reason for the delay factor weighed in favor of the
defendants, it was outweighed by the facts that defendants failed to assert
their right and failed to demonstrate that they were actually prejudiced by the
delay in bringing them to trial.  78 H. 54, 890 P.2d 291.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant was substantially responsible for pretrial
delay and failed to assert right to speedy trial, allowing defendant's case to
proceed to trial after eleven-month delay was not error.  92 H. 192, 990 P.2d
90.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant not deprived of right to speedy trial;
nineteen-month delay between arrest and trial is presumptively prejudicial;
defendant's right to speedy trial accrued when arrested.  4 H. App. 222, 665
P.2d 165.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated.  8 H.
App. 284, 800 P.2d 623.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Among factors to be considered is prejudice to defendant
caused by oppressive pretrial incarceration, ignominy occasioned by pending
criminal charges, and difficulty of preparing for trial.  9 H. App. 232, 832 P.2d
737.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not violated where delay was caused by defendant's own
absence from Hawaii and consequent unavailability for trial, and defendant
failed to produce evidence that defendant suffered any prejudice.  83 H. 496
(App.), 927 P.2d 1379.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not violated where, although the prejudice prong of the
Barker analysis weighed in favor of defendant, this prejudice was outweighed by
the delay attributable to defendant and defendant's failure to demand a speedy
trial; that the unavailability of victim as a witness caused the
&quot;possibility of prejudice&quot; to defendant's defense did not support
defendant's position that defendant's speedy trial right was violated.  103 H.
490 (App.), 83 P.3d 753.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Cited:  56 H. 378, 537 P.2d 1187.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Right to be informed.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated where burglary indictment alleged all elements
of the crime and record indicated the specific crime intended to be committed,
though specific crime not alleged.  66 H. 312, 660 P.2d 39.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Accomplice instruction improper where each defendant was
charged separately and charges did not inform them of circumstances in which
they acted as accomplices.  72 H. 278, 815 P.2d 428.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State failed to adequately inform defendant of nature and
cause of the §134-6(a) charge.  78 H. 66, 890 P.2d 303.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 485-21 provides an essential element of offense
charged, when a defendant is charged with a criminal violation of Uniform
Securities Act; counts of indictment, which cited to §485-21, were
insufficient, as counts did not include essential elements of offenses
charged.  78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although prosecution's oral charge failed to include the word
&quot;bodily&quot; to modify &quot;injury&quot;, the omission did not alter the
nature and cause of the accusation such that a person of common understanding
would fail to comprehend it; thus, the oral charge was not so obviously
defective that by no reasonable construction could it be said to charge the
offense for which conviction was had; because omission of the word
&quot;bodily&quot; did not constitute an essential element of the offense,
harmless error.  99 H. 312, 55 P.3d 276.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated where minutes before trial was to commence,
complaint against defendant amended from driving while license suspended to
driving without a license.  81 H. 76 (App.), 912 P.2d 573.</p>
