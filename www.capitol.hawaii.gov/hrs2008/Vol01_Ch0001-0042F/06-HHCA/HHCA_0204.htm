<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§204.  Control by department of
&quot;available lands,&quot; return to board of land and natural resources,
when; other lands, use of.</b>  (a)  Upon the passage of this Act, all
available lands shall immediately assume the status of Hawaiian home lands and
be under the control of the department to be used and disposed of in accordance
with the provisions of this Act, except that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  In case any available land is under lease by the
Territory of Hawaii, by virtue of section 73 of the Hawaiian Organic Act, at
the time of the passage of this Act, such land shall not assume the status of
Hawaiian home lands until the lease expires or the board of land and natural
resources withdraws the lands from the operation of the lease.  If the land is
covered by a lease containing a withdrawal clause, as provided in section 73(d)
of the Hawaiian Organic Act, the board of land and natural resources shall
withdraw such lands from the operation of the lease whenever the department
gives notice to the board that the department is of the opinion that the lands
are required by it for the purposes of this Act; and such withdrawal shall be
held to be for a public purpose within the meaning of that term as used in
section 73(d) of the Hawaiian Organic Act.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Any available land, including lands selected by
the department out of a larger area, as provided by this Act, not leased as
authorized by section 207(a) of this Act, may be returned to the board of land
and natural resources as provided under section 212 of this Act, or may be
retained for management by the department.  Any Hawaiian home lands general
lease issued by the department after June 30, 1985, shall contain a withdrawal
clause allowing the department to withdraw the land leased at any time during
the term of the lease for the purposes of this Act.</p>

<p class=1ParagraphContd>              In the management of any retained
available lands not required for leasing under section 207(a), the department
may dispose of those lands or any improvements thereon to the public, including
native Hawaiians, on the same terms, conditions, restrictions, and uses
applicable to the disposition of public lands in chapter 171, Hawaii Revised
Statutes; provided that the department may not sell or dispose of such lands in
fee simple except as authorized under section 205 of this Act; provided further
that the department is expressly authorized to negotiate, prior to negotiations
with the general public, the disposition of Hawaiian home lands or any
improvements thereon to a native Hawaiian, or organization or association owned
or controlled by native Hawaiians, for commercial, industrial, or other
business purposes, in accordance with the procedures set forth in chapter 171,
Hawaii Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The department, with the approval of the
Secretary of the Interior, in order to consolidate its holdings or to better
effectuate the purposes of this Act, may exchange the title to available lands
for land, privately or publicly owned, of an equal value.  All lands so
acquired by the department shall assume the status of available lands as though
the land were originally designated as available lands under section 203 of
this Act, and all lands so conveyed by the department shall assume the status
of the land for which it was exchanged.  The limitations imposed by section
73(l) of the Hawaiian Organic Act and the land laws of Hawaii as to the area
and value of land that may be conveyed by way of exchange shall not apply to
exchanges made pursuant hereto.  No such exchange of land publicly owned by the
State shall be made without the approval of two-thirds of the members of the
board of land and natural resources.  For the purposes of this paragraph, lands
&quot;publicly owned&quot; means land owned by a county or the State or the
United States.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Unless expressly provided elsewhere in
this Act, lands or an interest therein acquired by the department pursuant to
section, 221(c), or 225(b), or any other section of this Act authorizing the
department to acquire lands or an interest therein, may be managed and disposed
of in the same manner and for the same purposes as Hawaiian home lands. [Am
