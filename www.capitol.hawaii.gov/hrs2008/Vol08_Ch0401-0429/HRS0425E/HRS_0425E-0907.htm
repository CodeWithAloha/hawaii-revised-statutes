<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §425E-<strong>907  Certificate of
withdrawal; effect of failure to have certificate.  </strong></b>(a)  A foreign
limited partnership registered to transact business in this State may withdraw
from this State upon procuring from the director a certificate of withdrawal. 
In order to procure a certificate of withdrawal, the foreign limited
partnership shall deliver to the director an application for withdrawal,
certified and signed by a general partner, which shall set forth:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The name of the foreign limited partnership and
the state or country under the laws of which it is formed;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  That the foreign limited partnership is not
transacting business in this State;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  That the foreign limited partnership surrenders
its authority to transact business in this State;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  That the foreign limited partnership revokes the
authority of its registered agent in this State to accept service of process
and consents that service of process in any action, suit, or proceeding based
upon any cause of action arising in this State during the time the partnership
was authorized to transact business in this State may thereafter be made on the
partnership by service thereof on the director;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The name and address of each general partner;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  The dates that notice of the foreign limited partnership's
intent to withdraw from this State was published, once in each of four
successive weeks (four publications) in a newspaper of general circulation
published in this State, or a statement that publication was not made;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  That all taxes, debts, obligations, and
liabilities of the foreign limited partnership in this State have been paid and
discharged or that adequate provision has been made therefor;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  A mailing address to which the director may mail
a copy of any process against the foreign limited partnership that may be
served on the director; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  Such additional information as may be necessary
or appropriate in order to enable the director to determine and assess any
unpaid fees payable by the foreign limited partnership.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  After the filing of the application of
withdrawal, the director shall issue a certificate of withdrawal which shall be
effective as of the date of the filing of the application of withdrawal, and
the authority of the foreign limited partnership to transact business in this
State shall cease.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A withdrawal shall not terminate the
authority of the director to accept service of process on the foreign limited
partnership with respect to causes of action arising out of the transaction of
business in this State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A foreign limited partnership transacting
business in this State may not maintain an action or proceeding in this State
unless it has a certificate of authority to transact business in this State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The failure of a foreign limited
partnership to have a certificate of authority to transact business in this
State shall not impair the validity of a contract or act of the foreign limited
partnership or prevent the foreign limited partnership from defending an action
or proceeding in this State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  A partner of a foreign limited partnership
shall not be liable for the obligations of the foreign limited partnership
solely by reason of the foreign limited partnership's having transacted
business in this State without a certificate of authority.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  If a foreign limited partnership transacts
business in this State without a certificate of authority or cancels its
certificate of authority, it consents that service of process in any action,
suit, or proceeding based upon any cause of action arising out of the
transaction of business in this State may thereafter be made on the partnership
by service thereof on the director. [L 2003, c 210, pt of §1; am L 2004, c 121,
