<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§523A-7]  Burden of proof as to property
evidenced by record of check or draft.</b>  <i>[Section effective July 1,
2009.  For current section, see below.]</i>  A record of the issuance of a
check, draft, or similar instrument shall be prima facie evidence of an obligation. 
In claiming property from a holder who is also the issuer, the administrator's
burden of proof as to the existence and amount of the property and its
abandonment shall be satisfied by showing issuance of the instrument and
passage of the requisite period of abandonment.  Defenses of payment,
satisfaction, discharge, and want of consideration are affirmative defenses
that shall be established by the holder. [L 2008, c 55, pt of §1]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§523A-7]  Funds owing under life insurance
policies.</b>  <i>[Section repealed July 1, 2009.]</i>  (a)  Funds held or
owing under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract that has
matured or terminated are presumed abandoned if unclaimed for more than five
years after the funds became due and payable as established from the records of
the insurance company holding or owing the funds, but property described in
subsection (c)(2) is presumed abandoned if unclaimed for more than two years. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If a person other than the insured or
annuitant is entitled to the funds and an address of the person is not known to
the company or it is not definite and certain from the records of the company
who is entitled to the funds, it is presumed that the last known address of the
person entitled to the funds is the same as the last known address of the
insured or annuitant according to the records of the company. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  For purposes of this part, a life or
endowment insurance policy or annuity contract not matured by actual proof of
the death of the insured or annuitant according to the records of the company
is matured and the proceeds due and payable if: </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The company knows that the insured or annuitant
has died; or </p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>     (2)  (A)  The insured has attained, or would have
attained if the insured were living, the limiting age under the mortality table
on which the reserve is based; </p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The policy was in force at the time the
insured attained, or would have attained, the limiting age specified in
subparagraph (A); and </p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Neither the insured nor any other person
appearing to have an interest in the policy within the preceding two years,
according to the records of the company, has assigned, readjusted, or paid
premiums on the policy, subjected the policy to a loan, corresponded in writing
with the company concerning the policy, or otherwise indicated an interest as
evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file prepared by an employee of
the company. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For purposes of this part, the application
of an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision
contained in an insurance policy does not prevent a policy from being matured
or terminated under subsection (a) if the insured has died or the insured or
the beneficiary of the policy otherwise has become entitled to the proceeds
thereof before the depletion of the cash surrender value of a policy by the
application of those provisions. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  If the laws of this State or the terms of
the life insurance policy require the company to give notice to the insured or
owner that an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision
has been exercised and the notice, given to an insured or owner whose last
known address according to the records of the company is in this State, is
undeliverable, the company shall make a reasonable search to ascertain the policyholder's
correct address to which the notice must be mailed. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, if the company learns of the death of the insured or annuitant and the
beneficiary has not communicated with the insurer within four months after the
death, the company shall take reasonable steps to pay the proceeds to the
beneficiary. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Commencing two years after May 18, 1983,
every change of beneficiary form issued by an insurance company under any life
or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract to an insured or owner who is
a resident of this State shall request the following information: </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The name of each beneficiary, or if a class of
beneficiaries is named, the name of each current beneficiary in the class; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The address of each beneficiary; and </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The relationship of each beneficiary to the
insured. [L 1983, c 37, pt of §2]</p>
