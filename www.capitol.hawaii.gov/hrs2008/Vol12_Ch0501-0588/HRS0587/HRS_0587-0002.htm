<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Department's rules implementing foster custody obligations of
section were contrary to statutory purpose; section does not relieve department
of duty to provide for needs of children taken into custody on basis of their
relationship to foster parents.  73 H. 15, 827 P.2d 1144.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Responsibility of department of human services discussed,
where family court erred in concluding that adoption agreement, which allowed
termination of foster board payments prior to completion of adoption process,
violated public policy.  74 H. 409, 849 P.2d 55.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although child's failure to exhaust administrative remedies
available under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
precluded family court from ordering health department to pay for child's
mental health services, child's status as &quot;ward of the state&quot; created
an independent state basis that obligated the State to pay, which the human
services department, as child's co-custodian, was ultimately accountable for. 
96 H. 272, 30 P.3d 878.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In light of this section and the permanent plan objective to
&quot;maintain the relationship between the children and their birth
family&quot;, parents correctly contended that family court should have granted
their leave to intervene, and family court abused its discretion by denying
parents the opportunity to present evidence to show that visitation was in the
best interests of the children.  109 H. 399, 126 P.3d 1086.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As foster guardian of a minor child, the State may remove
child from foster caretakers and place child with adoptive family without
necessity of family court approval and without regard to fitness or stability
of foster caretakers.  7 H. App. 547, 784 P.2d 873.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As permanent custodian's &quot;duties and rights of a legal
custodian and family member&quot; are subject to the ultimate control of the
family court, court did not abuse discretion when it ordered that children not
be removed from current foster family placements without prior court approval. 
103 H. 130 (App.), 80 P.3d 20.</p>
