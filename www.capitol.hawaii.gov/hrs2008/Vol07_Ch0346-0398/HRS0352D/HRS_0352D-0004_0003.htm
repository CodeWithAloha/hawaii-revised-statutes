of the contracted provider or subcontractor has been convicted of an offense
for which incarceration is a sentencing option; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The office finds that the criminal history record
of the employee, prospective employee, or volunteer of the contracted provider

receiving direct services by that employee, prospective employee, or volunteer.</p>
