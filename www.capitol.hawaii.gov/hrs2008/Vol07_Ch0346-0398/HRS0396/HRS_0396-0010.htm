Any employer who violates this chapter, or any occupational safety and health
standard promulgated hereunder or any rule or regulation issued under the
authority of this chapter, or who violates or fails to comply with any
citation, notice or order made under or by virtue of this chapter or under or
by virtue of any rule or regulation of the department, or who defaces,
displaces, destroys, damages, or removes without the authority of the
department any safety device, safeguards, notice or warning required by this
chapter or any rule or regulation of the department may be assessed a civil
penalty as specified in this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Any employer who has received an order or
citation for a serious violation of any standard or rule adopted pursuant to
this chapter shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $7,000 for each
violation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Any employer who has received an order or
citation for a violation of any standard or rule adopted pursuant to this
chapter, and the violation is specifically determined not to be of a serious
nature, may be assessed a civil penalty of up to $7,000 for each violation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Each day a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation except that during an abatement period only, no
additional penalty shall be levied against the employer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Any employer who violates any of the
posting requirements prescribed under this chapter shall be assessed a civil
penalty of up to $7,000 for each violation.</p>

or by both.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  The director shall have authority to

the employer, and the history of previous violations.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  Civil penalties imposed under this chapter
shall be paid to the department and may be recovered by civil action in the
name of the department and the State brought in the district or circuit court

employer has its principal office.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (l)  When an alleged violation of any provision
of this chapter or any standard, rule, or order made thereunder has occurred,
the department shall promptly issue a written citation, order, or notice
thereof to the employer who shall be required to post the citation, order, or
notice.  The citation, order, or notice thereof shall include the abatement
requirements and within a reasonable time the employer shall be advised of the
proposed sanctions, including proposed penalties.  Whenever reference is made
to posting of any citation, order, notice, petition, decision, or any other
type of document issued by the director under this chapter and rules adopted
pursuant to this chapter, the employer shall post copies of the document at the
work site involved or affected and at the place or places where notices to the
employees involved are normally posted.  Where posting starts the time for
notice of action to or for appeal by employees under this chapter and rules
adopted under this chapter, the document shall be posted by the employer upon
receipt or on the next business day following receipt.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (m)  Whoever knowingly makes any false

chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000,
or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (n)  Criminal offenses committed against any
employee of the State acting within the scope of the employee's office,
employment, or authority under this chapter shall be subject to the penalties
set forth in the Hawaii Penal Code; provided that:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (1)  Ten years shall be added to the maximum
term of imprisonment (unless life imprisonment is imposed) and $50,000 shall be
added to the maximum fine imposed for conviction of a class A felony;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Five years shall be added to the maximum
term of imprisonment and $25,000 shall be added to the maximum fine imposed for
conviction of a class B felony;</p>
