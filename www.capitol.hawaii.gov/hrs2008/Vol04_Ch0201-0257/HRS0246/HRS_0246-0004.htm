<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §246-4  Assessment of property; to whom in
general.</b>  Real property shall be assessed in its entirety to the owner
thereof; provided that where improved residential land has been leased for a
term of fifteen years or more, the real property shall be assessed in its
entirety to the lessee or the lessee's successor in interest holding the land
for such term under such lease and the lessee or successor in interest shall be
deemed the owner of the real property in its entirety for the purposes of this
chapter; provided, however, that the lease and any extension, renewal,
assignment, or agreement to assign the lease (1) shall have been duly entered
into and recorded in the bureau of conveyances or filed in the office of the
assistant registrar of the land court prior to January 1 preceding the tax year
for which the assessment is made, and (2) shall provide that the lessee shall
pay all taxes levied on the property during the term of the lease.</p>

government lease shall be considered as owners during the time any real
property is held or controlled by them as such, as more fully provided in
section 246-36; and further, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
this chapter, any tenant occupying government land, whether such occupancy be
on a permit, license, month to month tenancy, or otherwise, shall be considered
as owner where such occupancy has continued for a period of one year or more,
as more fully provided in section 246-36.  Persons holding any real property
under an agreement to purchase the same, shall be considered as owners during
the time the real property is held or controlled by them as such; provided the

recorded in the bureau of conveyances or filed in the office of the assistant
registrar of the land court prior to January&nbsp;1 preceding the tax year for
which the assessment is made, and (2) shall provide that the lessee shall pay
all taxes levied on the property during the term of the lease. [L 1932 2d, c
