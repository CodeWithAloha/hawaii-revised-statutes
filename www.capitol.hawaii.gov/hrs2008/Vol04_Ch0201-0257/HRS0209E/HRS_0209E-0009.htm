<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §209E-9  Eligibility; qualified business;
sale of property or services.</b>  (a)  Any business firm may be eligible to be
designated a qualified business for purposes of this chapter if the business:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Begins the operation of a trade or business
within an enterprise zone;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  During each taxable year has at least fifty per
cent of its enterprise zone establishment's gross receipts attributable to the
active conduct of trade or business within the enterprise zone; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph style='margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-1.5in'>     (3)  (A)  Increases
its average annual number of full-time employees by at least ten per cent by
the end of its first tax year of participation, and during each subsequent
taxable year at least maintains that higher level of employment; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Increases its gross sales of agricultural
crops produced, or agricultural products processed within the enterprise zone
by two per cent annually.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>For business firms engaged in producing or
processing agricultural products, receipts from value-added products made from
crops grown within an enterprise zone and sold at retail pursuant to the limits
of subsection (e) shall count toward the gross receipts requirement under
paragraph (2).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A business firm may also be eligible to be
designated a qualified business for purposes of this chapter if the business:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Is actively engaged in the conduct of a trade or
business in an area immediately prior to an area being designated an enterprise
zone;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Meets the requirements of subsection (a)(2); and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph style='margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-1.5in'>     (3)  (A)  Increases
its average annual number of full-time employees employed at the business'
establishment or establishments located within the enterprise zone by at least
ten per cent by the end of the first year of operation, and by at least fifteen
per cent by the end of each of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh years of
operation; provided that the percentage increase shall be based upon the
employee count at the beginning of the initial year of operation within the
enterprise zone; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Increases its gross sales of agricultural
crops produced, or agricultural products processed within the enterprise zone
by two per cent annually.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  After designation as an enterprise zone,
each qualified business firm in the zone shall submit annually to the
department an approved form supplied by the department that provides the
information necessary for the department to determine if the business firm
qualifies as a qualified business.  The approved form shall be submitted by
each business to the governing body of the county in which the enterprise zone
is located, then forwarded to the department by the governing body of the
county.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The form referred to in subsection (c)
shall be prima facie evidence of the eligibility of a business for the purposes
of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Tangible personal property shall be sold
at an establishment of a qualified business within an enterprise zone and the
transfer of title to the buyer of the tangible personal property shall take
place in the same enterprise zone in which the tangible personal property is
sold.  Services shall be sold at an establishment of a qualified business
engaged in a service business within an enterprise zone and the services shall
be delivered in the same enterprise zone in which sold.  Any services rendered
outside an enterprise zone shall not be deemed to be the services of a
qualified business.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  For any fiscal year that includes
September 11, 2001, a business may use its average annual number of full-time
employees as of August 31, 2001--rather than its average annual number at the
end of its fiscal year including September 11, 2001--if necessary to meet the
requirements of subsection (a)(3) and (4) or (b)(3).  A business may also use
its average annual number of full-time employees at the end of its fiscal year
that includes September 11, 2001, as its base number of full-time employees if
necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (a)(3) and (4) or (b)(3) in
future fiscal years. [L 1986, c 78, pt of §1; am L 1989, c 390, §4; am L 1995,
