<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §238-6  Collection of tax by seller;
penalty.</b>  (a)  For purposes of the taxes due under sections 238-2 and
238-2.3, every seller having in the State, regularly or intermittently, any
property, tangible or intangible, any place of business, or any representation
as hereinabove defined, (and irrespective of the seller's having or not having
qualified to do business in the State) shall, if the seller makes sales of
property, services, or contracting for use in the State (whether or not the
sales are made in the State), collect from the purchaser the taxes imposed by
sections 238-2 and 238-2.3, on the use of the property, services, or
contracting so sold by the seller, if the seller is not subject to the use tax
under this chapter on the importation of the property into the State.  The
collection shall be made within twenty days after the accrual of the tax or
within such other period as shall be fixed by the director of taxation upon the
application of the seller, and the seller shall give to the purchaser a receipt
therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the director; provided that this
subsection shall not apply to vehicles registered under section 286-50.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The director, in the director's
discretion, upon application therefor and under terms and conditions prescribed
by the director, may relieve any seller of the duty of collecting and paying
over the tax imposed by subsection (a) above, if the director is satisfied that
the tax can be effectively collected by other means.  Exemption from the duty of
collecting the tax may be canceled at any time when the director finds that the
tax cannot be effectively collected by other means.  The director likewise may
terminate the duty and authority of any seller to collect and pay over the tax
imposed by subsection (a) above if the director finds, as to such seller, that
the tax cannot be effectively collected by such means.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The director, in the director's
discretion, upon application therefor and under terms and conditions prescribed
by the director, may authorize the collection of the tax imposed by this
chapter by a seller not otherwise required to collect the tax.  The seller,
when so authorized, shall have the duty of collecting and paying over the tax
in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as set out in
subsection (a).  The authority may be canceled at any time when, in the
judgment of the director, the tax can more effectively be collected by other
means.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  In case any seller required or authorized
to collect the tax under this chapter fails to collect the same, or having
collected the tax fails to pay over the same as provided by this chapter, the
seller shall nevertheless be personally liable to the State for the amount of
the tax, but it shall be a defense to such liability that the indebtedness for
the price is a worthless account actually charged off for income tax purposes,
if and to the extent that the collections of the price do not equal the tax.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Every seller required or authorized to
collect the tax shall make returns and payments of the tax at the same time and
in the same manner as is provided with respect to taxpayer by section 238-5. 
All provisions of this chapter with respect to returns, reports, records,
payments, penalties, and interest, appeals, investigations, and audits,
assessments, tax collections procedure, criminal offenses, and the general
administrative powers and duties of the director, shall apply to such sellers
the same as to taxpayers.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The tax collected pursuant to this section
shall be held in trust for the State and for payment to the proper collecting
officer in the manner and at the time required by this chapter.  Any person
collecting such tax who appropriates or converts the same to the person's own
use or to any use other than the payment of the tax as herein provided, and who
fails to pay over the amount of tax so collected at the time required by this
chapter, shall be deemed guilty of an embezzlement of property of the State and
shall be fined more than five times the amount of money so embezzled or
imprisoned at hard labor not more than ten years, and any failure by the person
so collecting the tax to pay the same over within the time provided by this
chapter, after demand therefor, shall be taken and held to be prima facie
evidence of the embezzlement. [L 1965, c 155, pt of §2; Supp, §119-6; HRS
