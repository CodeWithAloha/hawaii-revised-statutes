insurance producers.</b>  (a)  In recommending to a consumer the purchase of an
annuity or the exchange of an annuity that results in another insurance
transaction or series of insurance transactions, the insurance producer, or the
insurer where no producer is involved, shall have reasonable grounds for
believing that the recommendation is suitable for the consumer on the basis of
the facts disclosed by the consumer about the consumer's investments, other
insurance products, financial situation, and needs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Prior to the execution of a purchase or
exchange of an annuity resulting from a recommendation, an insurance producer,
or an insurer where no producer is involved, shall make reasonable efforts to
obtain information concerning:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The consumer's financial status;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The consumer's tax status;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The consumer's investment objectives; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Such other information used or considered to be
reasonable by the insurance producer, or the insurer where no producer is
involved, in making recommendations to the consumer.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>  (c)(1)  Except as provided under paragraph (2), neither
an insurance producer, nor an insurer where no producer is involved, shall have
any obligation to a consumer related to any recommendation if a consumer:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Refuses to provide relevant information
requested by the insurer or insurance producer;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Decides to enter into an insurance

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  An insurer shall make reasonable inquiry
to ensure that the third party contracting under subsection (f) is performing
the functions required under subsection (d) and shall take such action as is
reasonable under the circumstances to enforce the contractual obligation to
perform the functions.  An insurer may comply with its obligation to make
reasonable inquiry by:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Annually obtaining a certification from a third
party senior manager who has responsibility for the delegated functions that
the manager has a reasonable basis to represent, and does represent, that the
third party is performing the required functions; provided that no person may
provide a certification unless:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The person has a reasonable basis for

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  An insurer that contracts with a third
party pursuant to subsection (f) and that complies with the requirements to
supervise in subsection (g) shall have fulfilled its responsibilities under
subsection (d).</p>

independent agency is not required by subsections (d) and (e) to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Review, or provide for review of, all insurance
producer-solicited transactions; or</p>

agency who contracts with an insurer under subsection (f) shall promptly, when
requested by the insurer under subsection (g), give a certification as
described in subsection (g) or give a clear statement that it is unable to
satisfy the certification criteria.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  Compliance with the National Association
of Securities Dealers Conduct Rules pertaining to suitability shall satisfy the
requirements under this section for recommending variable annuities.  Nothing
in this subsection shall limit the insurance commissioner's ability to enforce
