<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§431:10C-307.7  Insurance fraud; penalties. 
</b>(a)  A person commits the offense of insurance fraud if the person acts or
omits to act with intent to obtain benefits or recovery or compensation for
services provided, or provides legal assistance or counsel with intent to
obtain benefits or recovery, through the following means:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Knowingly presenting, or causing or permitting to
be presented, any false information on a claim;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Knowingly presenting, or causing or permitting to
be presented, any false claim for the payment of a loss;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Knowingly presenting, or causing or permitting to
be presented, multiple claims for the same loss or injury, including presenting
multiple claims to more than one insurer, except when these multiple claims are
appropriate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Knowingly making, or causing or permitting to be
made, any false claim for payment of a health care benefit;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Knowingly submitting, or causing or permitting to
be submitted, a claim for a health care benefit that was not used by, or
provided on behalf of, the claimant;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Knowingly presenting, or causing or permitting to
be presented, multiple claims for payment of the same health care benefit
except when these multiple claims are appropriate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Knowingly presenting, or causing or permitting to
be presented, for payment any undercharges for benefits on behalf of a specific
claimant unless any known overcharges for benefits under this article for that
claimant are presented for reconciliation at the same time;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Aiding, or agreeing or attempting to aid,
soliciting, or conspiring with any person who engages in an unlawful act as
defined under this section; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  Knowingly making, or causing or permitting to be

during an official proceeding as defined by section 710-1000.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Violation of subsection (a) is a criminal
offense and shall constitute a:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Class B felony if the value of the benefits,
recovery, or compensation obtained or attempted to be obtained is more than
$20,000;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Class C felony if the value of the benefits,
recovery, or compensation obtained or attempted to be obtained is more than
$300; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Misdemeanor if the value of the benefits,
recovery, or compensation obtained or attempted to be obtained is $300 or less.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Where the ability to make restitution can
be demonstrated, any person convicted under this section shall be ordered by a
court to make restitution to an insurer or any other person for any financial
loss sustained by the insurer or other person caused by the act or acts for
which the person was convicted.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A person, if acting without malice, shall
not be subject to civil liability for providing information, including filing a
report, furnishing oral or written evidence, or giving testimony concerning
suspected, anticipated, or completed insurance fraud to a court, the
commissioner, the insurance fraud investigations unit, the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners, any federal, state, or county law enforcement or
regulatory agency, or another insurer if the information is provided only for
the purpose of preventing, investigating, or prosecuting insurance fraud,
except if the person commits perjury.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  This section shall not supersede any other
law relating to theft, fraud, or deception. Insurance fraud may be prosecuted
under this section, or any other applicable section, and may be enjoined by a
court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  An insurer shall have a civil cause of
action to recover payments or benefits from any person who has intentionally
obtained payments or benefits in violation of this section; provided that no
recovery shall be allowed if the person has made restitution under subsection
(c).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  All applications for insurance under this
article and all claim forms provided and required by an insurer, regardless of
the means of transmission, shall contain, or have attached to them, the
following or a substantially similar statement, in a prominent location and
typeface as determined by the insurer:  &quot;For your protection, Hawaii law
requires you to be informed that presenting a fraudulent claim for payment of a
loss or benefit is a crime punishable by fines or imprisonment, or both.&quot; 
The absence of such a warning in any application or claim form shall not
constitute a defense to a charge of insurance fraud under this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  An insurer, or the insurer's employee or
agent, having determined that there is reason to believe that a claim is being
made in violation of this section, shall provide to the insurance fraud
investigations unit within sixty days of that determination, information,
including documents and other evidence, regarding the claim in the form and
manner prescribed by the unit.  Information provided pursuant to this
subsection shall be protected from public disclosure to the extent authorized
by chapter 92F and section 431:2-209; provided that the unit may release the
information in an administrative or judicial proceeding to enforce this
section, to a federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory authority,
to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or to an insurer
aggrieved by the claim reasonably believed to violate this section. [L 1997, c
251, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 155, §2; am L 2000, c 182, §11]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the requisite state of mind for the value element of the
insurance fraud offense is not specifically mentioned in subsection (b)(2),
pursuant to §702-204, the state of mind for the value element of insurance
fraud is &quot;intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly&quot;.  117 H. 26
(App.), 175 P.3d 136.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under §702-206, the term &quot;intentional&quot;, as applied
to the value-attendant-circumstance element of the insurance fraud offense
under this section, means &quot;believes&quot;; also, §708-801(4) indicates
that either a defendant's &quot;belief&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot; is
sufficient to establish an intentional or knowing state of mind as to the value
element; thus, pursuant to §702-204, as a &quot;reckless&quot; state of mind
was applicable to the value element of the insurance fraud offense, defendant
was not exposed to a conviction based on a state of mind lower than what was
required.  117 H. 26 (App.), 175 P.3d 136.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where insurance fraud charge was based on a single incident
of culpable conduct - the submission of a false claim to the insurer for
insurance benefits - and not on two separate claims for benefits to repair,
respectively, the alleged self-inflicted scratches and pre-existing damages to
car, and evidence also disclosed that defendant had only one intention, one
general impulse, and one plan - to defraud insurer, insurance fraud offense was
a continuing offense and trial court did not err in denying defendant's request
to give jury a specific unanimity instruction.  117 H. 26 (App.), 175 P.3d 136.</p>
