same health care provider as a result of any accidental harm which is subject
to benefits under this article, and a health care provider may not establish a
pattern of consistently referring patients to the same attorney or law firm as
a result of any accidental harm which is subject to benefits under this
article.  Any attorney, or any attorney from the law firm of which the attorney
is a member or by which the attorney is employed, and that health care provider
engaged in such pattern shall be presumed to be in violation of this section.</p>

years.  The health care provider shall include in the disclosure a statement
indicating that the patient is free to choose a different health care provider.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The regulated industries complaints
