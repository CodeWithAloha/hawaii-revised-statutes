<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Professional society&quot; or
&quot;society&quot; means any association or other organization of persons engaged
in the same profession or occupation, or a specialty within a profession or
occupation, a primary purpose of which is to maintain the professional
standards of the persons engaged in its profession or occupation or specialty

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Quality assurance committee&quot; means
an interdisciplinary committee established by the board of trustees or
administrative staff of a licensed hospital, clinic, health maintenance
organization, preferred provider organization, or preferred provider network,
whose function is to monitor and evaluate patient care, and to identify, study,
and correct deficiencies and seek improvements in the patient care delivery
process.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  There shall be no civil liability for any
member of a peer review committee, ethics committee, or quality assurance
committee, or for any person who files a complaint with or appears as a witness
before those committees, for any acts done in the furtherance of the purpose
for which the peer review committee, ethics committee, or quality assurance committee

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  There shall be no civil liability for any

was established, unless such information is false and the person providing it
knew such information was false.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  This section shall not be construed to
confer immunity from liability upon any professional society, hospital, clinic,
health maintenance organization, preferred provider organization, or preferred
provider network, nor shall it affect the immunity of any shareholder or

liability for any professional society, hospital, clinic, health maintenance

committee means that body whose actions are final with respect to a particular

nationally or internationally, the final peer review committee for the purposes
of this subsection shall be the final committee in this State.  The quality
assurance committee shall report in writing to the department of commerce and
consumer affairs any information which identifies patient care by any person
engaged in a profession or occupation which does not meet hospital, clinic,
health maintenance organization, preferred provider organization, or preferred
provider network standards and which results in disciplinary action unless such
information is immediately transmitted to an established peer review
committee.  The report shall be filed within thirty business days following an
adverse decision.  The report shall contain information on the nature of the
action, its date, the reasons for, and the circumstances surrounding the
action; provided that specific patient identifiers shall be expunged.  If a
potential adverse decision was superseded by resignation or other voluntary
action that was requested or bargained for in lieu of medical disciplinary
action, the report shall so state.  The department shall prescribe forms for
the submission of reports required by this section.  Failure to comply with
this subsection shall be a violation punishable by a fine of not less than $100
for each member of the committee.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  In any civil action arising under this
section where a party seeks money damages or injunctive relief, or both, against
another party, and the case is subsequently decided, the court may, as it deems
just, assess against either party, and enter as part of its order, for which
execution may issue, a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees, in an amount to be
determined by the court upon a specific finding that the party's claim or
defense was frivolous.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  In determining the award of attorneys'
fees and the amounts to be awarded under subsection (f), the court must find in
writing that all claims or defenses made by the party are frivolous and are not
reasonably supported by the facts and the law in the civil action. [L 1970, c
