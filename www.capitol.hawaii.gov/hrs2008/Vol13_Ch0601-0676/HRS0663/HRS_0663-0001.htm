<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs argued that State waived its Eleventh
Amendment immunity through the enactment of §353-14 and the State's Tort Claims
Act [sic], §662-2 and this section, no express consent or applicable waiver
provisions found.  940 F. Supp. 1523.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the proper inquiry in this jurisdiction for the
assignability of a claim for relief is whether the cause of action alleges a
personal injury or an injury to property, and the complaint asserted
non-personal injuries, the professional malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty,
and fraud claims were assignable.  113 H. 373, 153 P.3d 444.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Bad faith.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Hawaii supreme court, seeking to avoid inequitable or absurd
result, would allow plaintiff's bad faith claim, where plaintiff submitted
claims to defendant insurer for losses suffered as a third-party beneficiary of
insurance contract.  947 F. Supp. 429.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Independent cause of action for breach of covenant of good
faith and fair dealing would not lie, where there was no coverage liability on
underlying insurance policy.  955 F. Supp. 1218.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant contended that claim for breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of
limitations governing damage to persons and property (§657-7), since there is
no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to
suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a &quot;personal
injury&quot;, and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is
found in the catchall provision of §657-1 (§657-1(4)).  986 F. Supp. 1334.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Limitations period applicable to cause of action for bad
faith, discussed; where complaint was not filed until almost one year after the
limitations period had lapsed, to the extent that complaint alleged a claim for
the tort of bad faith denial of benefits, summary judgment granted in favor of
defendant as to plaintiff's claim for tort of bad faith.  11 F. Supp. 2d 1204. 
</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violations of the unfair settlement provision,
§431:13-103(a), may be used as evidence to indicate bad faith in accordance
with the guidelines of Best Place, Inc. v. Penn America Ins. Co.  27 F. Supp.
2d 1211.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedies
provided to plaintiff by chapter 386; prior to filing a separate suit for bad
faith denial of benefits or payments, plaintiff must first exhaust all
available administrative remedies before the department of labor and industrial
relations, disability compensation division.  28 F. Supp. 2d 588.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insurer's motion granted to extent it sought summary judgment
as to claims against defendant, where uncontradicted evidence was that
defendant was the claims handler for subject insurance policy;  defendant did
not have a contract with plaintiffs; defendant could not be liable to
plaintiffs for bad faith.  74 F. Supp. 2d 975.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insurer's motion for summary judgment granted on defendant's
counterclaim alleging that insurer acted in tortious breach of implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing by, among other things, its failure to pay
underinsured motorist policy benefits, improper use of &quot;excuse&quot; that
defendant violated consent-to-settle clause, and wrongful pursuit of its offset
theory.  176 F. Supp. 2d 1005.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Hawaii's Best Place bad faith tort is law that impacts
insurance, but does not solely regulate it; therefore, plaintiff's claim as
stated arising under Best Place bad faith tort did not fit within Employee
Retirement Income Security Act's (ERISA) saving clause.  Controlling precedent
mandated that plaintiff's claim was related to the processing of a claim and
was preempted by ERISA because ERISA's civil remedy was plaintiff's sole avenue
of relief.  242 F. Supp. 2d 752.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where insured alleged that insurer breached covenant of good
faith and fair dealing by initiating action for declaratory judgment, insured
would be unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that insurer's
filing of lawsuit was based on an interpretation of disability insurance policy
that was unreasonable; among other things, a reasonable jury could decide issue
of fraud in insurer's favor based upon insured's failure to include 1990
surgery on insured's application for the policy.  248 F. Supp. 2d 974.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insurance company did not breach the duty of good faith and
fair dealing when it decided not to defend the operator of a concrete recycling
plant or indemnify the owner where, inter alia, it appeared that plaintiffs did
not disagree with insurance company's assertion that at a minimum, there was a
genuine dispute as to whether coverage existed under the insurance policy.  307
F. Supp. 2d 1170.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insurer's refusal to indemnify was not bad faith, where
insurer denied coverage based on an unsettled question of law and, based on the
court's ruling, was not ultimately obligated to indemnify insured; it was
premature to ascertain whether insurer's refusal to defend was bad faith.  504
F. Supp. 2d 998.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Controlling date for the purpose of calculating the statute
of limitations for plaintiff's claims of tortious breach of contract and bad
faith denial of insurance benefits was two years after the last payment of
motor vehicle insurance benefits; the date of plaintiff's receipt of payment,
within three days of the date on which the payment was mailed, was the date on
which the statute of limitations began to run.  520 F. Supp. 2d 1212.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff's claim for bad faith denial of insurance benefits,
which arose out of defendants' decision to seek arbitration, failed as a matter
of law; any delay that was caused was reasonable in light of plaintiff's
actions and did not amount to bad faith conduct.  520 F. Supp. 2d 1212.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Bad faith cause of action may be brought by first-party
insured for insurer misconduct.  82 H. 120, 920 P.2d 334.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Breach of implied contractual duties owed by workers'
compensation insurer to employee, including duty to handle and pay claims in
good faith, gives rise to independent tort cause of action by employee, the
intended third-party beneficiary.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where insured presented evidence that raised genuine issue of
material fact as to insurer's liability for bad faith if insurer's law firm's
conduct of defense breached law firm's duties towards insured and breach was
causally induced by insurer's actions, summary judgment erroneously entered in
favor of insurer on insured's bad faith claim.  90 H. 39, 975 P.2d 1159.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Any formal recognition of a claim for relief in favor of an
injured claimant against a third-party tortfeasor's insurance company for bad
faith settlement practices would require the assignment of the insured
tortfeasor's rights arising from an underlying insurance contract to the
injured plaintiff; the tort of bad faith settlement practices arises only from
a contract of insurance.  105 H. 112, 94 P.3d 667.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was no underlying insurance contract from which
the duty of good faith settlement practices could arise, injured third-party
claimant had no right to sue self-insured car rental company for bad faith. 
105 H. 112, 94 P.3d 667.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where insurer's denial of plaintiff's claim for no-fault
benefits was based upon an open question of law--whether &quot;the reasons&quot;
as used in §431:10C-304(3)(B) means &quot;all reasons&quot;--there was no bad
faith on the part of insurer for not having stated all the reasons for its
denial of plaintiff's claim.  109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff alleged that insurer handled the denial of
plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits in bad faith, plaintiff was not
precluded from bringing bad faith claim even where there was no coverage
liability on the underlying policy; thus, trial court erred in determining
that, because plaintiff's breach of contract claim failed, plaintiff's bad
faith claim must fail.  109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the question of whether the underinsured motorist
benefits settlement from non-party insurer would trigger the two-year statute
of limitations under §431:10C-315(a) (1993) for plaintiff's claim against
defendant insurer was an open question of law until this case, there was no bad
faith on the part of defendant insurer for having denied plaintiff's claim for
no-fault benefits on the basis of the statute of limitations.  109 H. 537, 128
P.3d 850.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As action for bad faith against insurer is an independent
tort, the proper limitation provision for bringing an action should not be that
provided in the insurance policy, but rather that provided in §657-7, which
limits causes of action for torts to two years.  88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d
639.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where insured's bad faith claim was not &quot;any issue
referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing&quot; under §658-5, and
action for bad faith in the first-party insurance context is independent of the
policy, an ongoing appraisal process did not bar insured from bringing a
lawsuit alleging bad faith handling of insured's claim.  88 H. 442 (App.), 967
P.2d 639.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where claimant failed to make a counteroffer or attempt to
engage in meaningful settlement discussions with workers' compensation insurer
regarding insurer's offer before suing insurer for bad faith refusal to settle,
failure was fatal to claimant's bad faith claim as it left claimant with
nothing more than speculation to support claimant's allegations.  112 H. 195
(App.), 145 P.3d 738.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where workers' compensation insurer's settlement offer simply
stated that the amount offered &quot;would be for closure of your entire
workers' compensation claim&quot;, offer could not reasonably be interpreted as
requiring workers' compensation claimant to release insurer from tort liability. 
112 H. 195 (App.), 145 P.3d 738.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In the context of the Hawaii workers' compensation scheme, a
physician is an incidental beneficiary rather than an intended third-party
beneficiary of the employer's workers' compensation insurance policy; thus, as
physician was not an intended third-party beneficiary of insurer's insurance
policy, physician did not have a cause of action in tort for bad faith against
insurer.  114 H. 122 (App.), 157 P.3d 561.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When read as a whole, or when considering both jury

inconsistent, or misleading.  78 H. 230, 891 P.2d 1022.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where department of education's (DOE) negligent acts
contributed to the conditions that facilitated the teacher's molestation of the
girl students, the DOE's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the
plaintiff parents' injuries; thus, trial court did not err in finding that the
DOE's negligence legally caused the plaintiff parents' various psychological
injuries.  100 H. 34, 58 P.3d 545.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Based upon the fact that the perpetrator of minor's injuries
had not been determined, department of human services social worker's
willingness and rush to entrust the care of minor to mother, complete disregard
of the medical evidence, and lenient verbal service agreement, and that minor
suffered injuries while in mother's care and custody, the trial court properly
concluded that department's conduct legally caused minor to sustain the
injuries.  117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant insurance company's motion for summary judgment
granted as to plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, where plaintiff alleged
that defendant's conduct was wanton and oppressive; there was not sufficient
evidence to reach clear and convincing standard, and thus the question of
punitives could not be put to a jury.  999 F. Supp. 1369.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  If plaintiff succeeded on bad faith claim, and plaintiff

<p class=XNotes>  Tort recovery, including recovery of punitive damages, is not
allowed under Hawaii law for breach of contract in the absence of conduct that

<p class=XNotes>  The collateral source rule prohibits reducing a plaintiff's
award of medical special damages to reflect the discounted amount paid by medicare/medicaid;

101 P.3d 1149.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As question of whether defendant's fraudulent
misrepresentation caused damage to plaintiffs by preventing them from receiving
the &quot;fair compromise value&quot; of their claims was one upon which the
trier of fact must be guided by expert legal testimony, trial court did not err
in concluding that &quot;expert lawyer testimony directed to the numerous

was required.  116 H. 277, 172 P.3d 1021.</p>

seek rescission of their settlement agreements in their complaint, but based on
the allegations of their complaint, &quot;unequivocally and knowledgeably&quot;
elected to affirm their settlement agreements and pursue an action for fraud,
trial court did not err in concluding that the measure of damages for the
plaintiffs' fraud action was &quot;the fair compromise value of the claim at
the time of the settlement&quot;.  116 H. 277, 172 P.3d 1021.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where unsubstantiated conclusions of plaintiffs' experts were
insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact that would preclude
summary judgment, trial court properly concluded that plaintiffs were &quot;unable

<p class=XNotes><b>Defamation.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' statements implying attorney's poor client
representation constitutionally protected speech and not defamatory where
general and specific contexts in which statements were made did not imply
assertion of an objective fact and statements were incapable of being proved
true or false.  56 F.3d 1147.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Totality of the circumstances revealed that statements by
president of labor organization were a call to arms, not assertions of
objective fact; the statements were not defamatory, and therefore were fully
protected by federal labor law.  302 F.3d 998.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  False statement that attorney had been a prosecutor in South Africa was libelous per se; no recovery for defamation based on a truthful statement
of fact.  825 F. Supp. 906.</p>

plaintiff in false light were privileged expressions of opinion.  825 F. Supp.

defamation claim.  833 F. Supp. 802.</p>

Supp. 1403.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where alleged defamatory statements occurred during a
conversation between an employee of defendant and representatives of defendant's
temporary disability insurer, there was a qualified privilege as defendant and
its insurer shared a common interest, their business relationship; an employer
who communicates information to its insurance carrier is acting, at the very
least, to promote the private interest of the companies; questions remained
regarding potential abuse of the privilege.  26 F. Supp. 2d 1241.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant magazine's motion for judgment on the pleadings, or
in the alternative, for summary judgment granted, where, inter alia, plaintiff

310, 876 P.2d 1278.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's statement not false or defamatory where statement
was rhetorical hyperbole--figurative or hyperbolic language that would negate

F.2d 375.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant contended that claim for breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of
limitations governing damage to persons and property (§657-7), since there is
no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to
suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a &quot;personal
injury&quot;, and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is
found in the catchall provision of §657-1 (§657-1(4)).  986 F. Supp. 1334.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  It could not be disputed that by the time the underinsured
motorist benefits were paid, plaintiff either knew or should have known that

plaintiff injury; any claims for emotional distress were time-barred.  11 F.
Supp. 2d 1204.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Limitations period applicable to cause of action for bad
faith, discussed; where complaint was not filed until almost one year after the

defendant as to plaintiff's claim for tort of bad faith.  11 F. Supp. 2d 1204. 
</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' claims against certain defendants were
time-barred, where those defendants were first named as parties in first

did not relate back to the date the original complaint was filed.  289 F. Supp.
2d 1197.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' negligence claims were dismissed with prejudice;
there was no basis for allowing derivative litigation over claims that an

330 F. Supp. 2d 1101.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant automobile manufacturer may assert a defense of

<p class=XNotes>  Interspousal tort immunity upheld.  63 H. 653, 634 P.2d 586.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In implied warranty and strict products liability tort
actions, express assumption of risk is available as separate defense that may
bar recovery; implied assumption of risk is defense only when plaintiff's assumption
of risk is a form of contributory negligence.  74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Assumption of risk defense generally applied to tort claims
for relief.  74 H. 85, 839 P.2d 10.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Union shop steward's claim for defamation was not preempted

<p class=XNotes>  By plaintiff's participation in the sport of golfing,
plaintiff assumed all of the ordinary dangers incident to the game, i.e., the
inherent risks, including the inherent risk that golf participants will be hit
by errant shots; as a co-participant, defendant's errant shot was neither
intentional nor reckless, and defendant had no duty to warn plaintiff of the
errant ball; thus, the doctrine of primary implied assumption of risk applied
to bar plaintiff's claim against defendant.  110 H. 367, 133 P.3d 796.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In complaints alleging intentional interference with
contractual relations and prospective economic advantage, tortious inducement
of breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference with contractual

a desire to harm which is independent of the desire to protect their clients&quot;,
and the complaints were devoid of any allegations that the lawyers &quot;acted
for personal gain or with ill-will towards&quot; plaintiffs, lawyers'
management of the inspection and review process of plaintiff's books and

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant did not make a promise to the effect that

<p class=XNotes>  Section 281-78(a)(2)(A) (1989) imposes a duty to innocent

assembly where neither manufacturer contributed to the alleged defect, had no
control over it, and did not produce it.  92 H. 1, 986 P.2d 288.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where no evidence that road grader owner knew or had reason
to know of dangerous condition of tire rim assembly and that condition created
a foreseeable risk of harm to tire repairman, plaintiff failed to establish
genuine issue of material fact as to whether owner was negligent for failure to
discharge its duty of ordinary care or had either actual or constructive notice
of possible danger of lock ring exploding.  92 H. 1, 986 P.2d 288.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because a commercial establishment should be aware of the
potentially hazardous conditions that arise from its mode of operation, an

which medication to prescribe, and the dosage prescribed.  98 H. 296, 47 P.3d
1209.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A physician owes a duty to non-patient third parties injured
in an automobile accident caused by an adverse reaction to a medication

<p class=XNotes>  Department of education breached the duty it owed to molested
students' parents by (1) reinstating teacher without conducting a reasonable
investigation to ascertain another student's allegation; (2) failing to
supervise or restrict teacher's contact with children after principal became
aware or should have become aware that teacher resumed molestation conduct; and
(3) principal's interviewing and inducing students to disclose molestation and
failing to notify students' parents of that disclosure.  100 H. 34, 58 P.3d

<p class=XNotes>  The duty of care that the department of education (DOE) owes
to students and their parents is, on a general level, a duty to take whatever
precautions are necessary reasonably to ensure the safety and welfare of the

anticipates, or reasonably should anticipate; this duty arises from the &quot;special
relationship&quot; that the DOE shares with its students and their parents.

<p class=XNotes>  Appellate court erred in concluding as a matter of law that
because privately owned road had been impliedly dedicated to the public, the
public had an easement over the road, which would have subjected the owner of
the easement to the duty to keep it in repair and to liability for injuries
caused by such failure; whether an implied easement exists depends on the parties'
intent and was a question of fact for the jury.  103 H. 385, 83 P.3d 100.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  While the fact that the privately owned road was platted on a
subdivision map, that §265A-1 authorized counties to repair and maintain
private streets, and §46-16 authorized counties to regulate traffic on private
streets, and each of these factors was significant in determining which party
or parties had control of the private roadway, appellate court erred in
concluding as a matter of law that defendant property owners did not control
roadway and thus had no duty to maintain, repair, or warn of a dangerous
condition; the issue of control of the roadway was a question of fact for the
jury.  103 H. 385, 83 P.3d 100.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under Act 190, L 1996, the State is required to warn of &quot;extremely
dangerous&quot; ocean conditions (1) that occur at &quot;public beach parks&quot;,
(2) if these conditions are typical for the specific beach, and (3) if they
present a risk of serious injury or death; as the Ke'anae Landing area was not
a public beach park, the State, as the owner and occupier of Ke'anae Landing
and its surrounding ocean water, did not have a duty to warn of any &quot;extremely
dangerous&quot; ocean conditions at Ke'anae Landing.  109 H. 198, 124 P.3d 943.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where Act 190, L 1996, imposed no duty upon the State to warn
of dangerous natural ocean conditions at &quot;beach accesses, coastal
accesses, or in areas that are not public beach parks&quot;, trial court
correctly concluded that Act 190 relieved the State of any duty to warn
plaintiffs of any dangerous ocean conditions at the Ke'anae Landing area.  109
H. 198, 124 P.3d 943.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  County did not have a duty to warn plaintiff of any dangers
associated with diving in Queen's Bath, an ocean tide pool, and did not
voluntarily assume a duty to warn by virtue of its signs pertaining to
hazardous ocean and trail conditions; any duty that county may have had towards
plaintiff because of the signs did not give rise to liability to plaintiff. 
110 H. 189, 130 P.3d 1054.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Even if Queen's Bath is deemed a &quot;de facto&quot; beach
park, no liability on the part of the State or county arose because (1) the
dangers found in Queen's Bath are natural conditions, which do not trigger a
duty to warn on the part of the State and county, and (2) the provision of L
1996, Act 190, expressly exempt the State and county from liability for failing
to warn of dangerous natural conditions.  110 H. 189, 130 P.3d 1054.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Inasmuch as the issue of foreseeability in the context of
duty was a question of law for the court to resolve, the court, not the trier of
fact, had to determine the existence and scope of duty, if any, owed by
defendant to plaintiffs.  112 H. 3, 143 P.3d 1205.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where evidence clearly established that the risk or hazard of
the buried cement bag being propelled in the air during a future excavation was
not what made the failure to remove the cement bag and to comply with the
contract specifications by defendant unreasonably dangerous, defendant's
general duty to use reasonable care did not include within its scope the
protection of plaintiff from the particular risk that plaintiff encountered;
thus, trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendant.  112
H. 3, 143 P.3d 1205.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where, after construction of the highway was completed, there
were complaints of water creating a potentially dangerous condition, the State
then had a duty to maintain the highway in a reasonably safe condition, which
included the duty to mitigate and warn of known hazards; the State breached
this duty and trial court erred in finding that the State's breach of duty was
not a substantial factor in causing plaintiff's death.  113 H. 332, 152 P.3d
504.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff's attorney did not owe defendants an
actionable duty, trial court did not err in dismissing defendants' third-party
claim against attorney alleging negligent handling of a settlement between
attorney's client and defendants resulting in damage to defendants.  114 H.
202, 159 P.3d 814.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Based upon statutory and regulatory mandates, the legislature
created a duty flowing to children specifically identified to the department of
human services as being the subject of suspected abuse; thus, the department
had a duty to protect the minor under the circumstances of the case.  117 H.
262, 178 P.3d 538.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In child abuse case, based upon the credible testimony of
child protective services expert, and undisputed findings of fact relating to
department of human services social worker's failure to properly and timely
complete investigation into minor's injury, trial court correctly concluded
that the department--through its social worker--breached the duty to use the
same degree of care, skill, and ability as an ordinarily careful professional
in the social worker's field would have exercised under similar circumstances. 
117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs did not assert any constitutional
violations, their claims were grounded in common law principles of negligence,
and the case did not involve involuntary commitment or custodial care, trial
court erred to the extent that it believed that the Youngberg professional
judgment standard applied to case involving the department of human services'
improper investigation and failure to protect abuse victim from future harm. 
117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because of the obvious danger to young children, it was
unreasonable to require that swimming pool manufacturer furnish labels with its
pools warning of that danger; swimming pool manufacturer's duty to put a safe

marketing the pool as will reasonably protect against injury to young children
arising from their use of the pool.  10 H. App. 547, 879 P.2d 572.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Chapter 520, the Hawaii recreational use statute, was not
intended to have created a universal defense available to a commercial
establishment such as landowner hotel, which has opened its land to the public
for commercial gain, against any and all liability for personal injury merely
because there is a &quot;recreational&quot; component to the establishment's
operation.  93 H. 477, 6 P.3d 349.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs, by averring in their affidavits that they were on
landowner's land for a commercial purpose at the time plaintiff was injured,
generated a genuine issue of material fact whether they were on the land for a
commercial purpose, in which case this chapter would not immunize the landowner
from liability, or whether they were present for an exclusively recreational
purpose, in which case this chapter would be available to landowner as a

<p class=XNotes>  In actions for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment,
district court conviction conclusively establishes probable cause even if
conviction is reversed.  56 H. 383, 538 P.2d 320.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellants' state tort claims for false arrest, false
imprisonment, and malicious prosecution failed as a matter of law because
appellants did not contest the preliminary hearing determination of probable
cause and their commitment to circuit court for trial.  Appellants failed to
cite to any persuasive or relevant authority in support of their contention
that where actions or inactions of the prosecutor subsequent to a preliminary
hearing &quot;erodes&quot; probable cause, an action for false arrest, false
imprisonment, or malicious prosecution arises.  76 H. 219, 873 P.2d 98.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Union shop steward's claim for malicious prosecution was

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's comments, while certainly distasteful, did not
rise to level of outrageousness necessary to maintain intentional infliction of
emotional distress claim.  866 F. Supp. 1285.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because plaintiffs did not allege physical injury, there
could be no recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress claim;
allegations about defendants' acts fell within meaning of outrageous conduct
regarding intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.  895 F. Supp.

<p class=XNotes>  Genuine issues of material fact existed as to every element
of plaintiff's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress; among
other things, a reasonable juror could find that defendant's (which tested
plaintiff's urine sample) failure to provide information about plaintiff's
urine test to plaintiff in a timely manner, which resulted in plaintiff losing
plaintiff's job for two years and allegedly caused plaintiff's depression, was
outrageous conduct.  303 F. Supp. 2d 1121.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff failed to allege facts sufficient to maintain
intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, where the claim apparently
stemmed from an alleged communication between plaintiff's union and one of

union president that plaintiff was not welcome to return to defendant's
premises.  353 F. Supp. 2d 1107.</p>

uncommon, experience of losing a job.  353 F. Supp. 2d 1107.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress

defendant engaged in outrageous conduct or that defendant's conduct caused
plaintiff extreme emotional distress.  396 F. Supp. 2d 1138.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress
(IIED) claim against a defendant was not preempted by Section 301 of the Labor
Management Relations Act; plaintiff stated sufficient facts to support an IIED
claim with respect to that defendant.  454 F. Supp. 2d 1056.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff neglected to file the intentional infliction of
emotional distress claim against defendants within the two-year tort statute of
limitations; among other things, the charge plaintiff filed with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission and the Hawaii civil rights commission charge
did not toll the statute of limitations for the claim.  468 F. Supp. 2d 1210.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that defendants falsely
told police that plaintiff violated a temporary restraining order for the

1113.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court did not err in awarding damages for emotional
distress to parents, where appellants claimed parents not entitled to recover

71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Jury instruction concerning negligent infliction of emotional
distress should contain the requirement of physical injury to a person, if
plaintiff was able to demonstrate such injury.  76 H. 310, 876 P.2d 1278.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence that
defendant acted unreasonably in the course of discharging plaintiff, plaintiff's
claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was properly dismissed
on summary judgment; circuit court properly entered summary judgment in favor
of defendant on plaintiff's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim,
where plaintiff presented no evidence of any physical injury to plaintiff or
anyone else. 76 H. 454, 879 P.2d 1037.  </p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant father's statement to sister of childhood sexual
abuse victim defendant allegedly abused was not so unreasonable or outrageous
as to give rise to cause of action by victim for intentional infliction of

<p class=XNotes>  Negligent infliction of emotional distress claim denied where
plaintiffs failed to furnish evidence of greater mental stress than transient &quot;concern&quot;,

<p class=XNotes>  Claim for negligent and/or intentional infliction of
emotional distress against Hawaii civil rights commission not barred under
§662-15(1), as acts of investigating complaint, instituting suit based on
finding of reasonable cause, and sending demand letter were part of routine
operations of commission and did not involve broad policy considerations
encompassed within the discretionary function exception.  88 H. 85, 962 P.2d

<p class=XNotes>  Where appellant's counterclaim lacked any allegation of
physical injury to appellant or another as a result of the conduct of the Hawaii civil rights commission, action for negligent infliction of emotional distress could
not be maintained.  88 H. 85, 962 P.2d 344.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Emotional distress damages resulting from breach of contract
recoverable only where parties specifically provide for them in the contract or
where the nature of the contract clearly indicates that such damages are within
the parties' contemplation or expectation in the event of a breach.  89 H. 234,
971 P.2d 707.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress for
which relief may be granted is stated, inter alia, where the negligent behavior
of a defendant subjects an individual to an actual, direct, imminent, and
potentially life-endangering threat to his or her physical safety by virtue of
exposure to HIV.  91 H. 470, 985 P.2d 661.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A plaintiff states a claim of negligent infliction of
emotional distress for which relief may be granted where he or she alleges,
inter alia, actual exposure to HIV-positive blood, whether or not there is a
predicate physical harm; assuming that the other elements of negligent
infliction of emotional distress are proved, a plaintiff is entitled to a
recovery if such actual exposure is proved as well.  91 H. 470, 985 P.2d 661.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of
emotional distress are (1) that the act allegedly causing the harm was
intentional or reckless, (2) that the act was outrageous, and (3) that the act
caused (4) extreme emotional distress to another.  102 H. 92, 73 P.3d 46.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Union shop steward's claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act where
employer's alleged conduct designed to threaten steward's liberty and
reputation went beyond mere &quot;threat, or actuality, of employment
discrimination&quot; stemming from a union-related dispute; to the extent that
steward could show that those acts were done in a particularly abusive manner,
they were outside the purview of preemption.   109 H. 520, 128 P.3d 833.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where manner in which insurer denied plaintiff's claim for
no-fault benefits was not in bad faith and insurer's conduct was thus
reasonable, and there was nothing in the record to indicate that plaintiff
suffered any extreme emotional distress as a result of insurer's conduct,
plaintiff failed to show that a genuine issue of material fact existed with
respect to plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and
trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of insurer.  109
H. 537, 128 P.3d 850.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court correctly determined that the department of human
services, which had a duty to protect minor and breached that duty, was liable
to father and grandfather for negligent infliction of emotional distress where

several broken bones, bruising to her body and was in serious condition, later
being told that there was a chance of minor &quot;expiring&quot;, after flying
to Oahu hospital where minor was transferred after surgery, again being

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant did not make a promise to the effect that

<p class=XNotes><b>Other torts.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' statements implying attorney's poor client
representation did not place attorney in false light where general and specific
contexts in which statements were made did not imply assertion of an objective
fact and statements were incapable of being proved true or false.  56 F.3d
1147.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  District court did not err in rejecting appellants' trademark
claim, since appellants could offer no evidence that trademark holder
voluntarily licensed its trademark to manufacturer or that trademark holder had
significant involvement in design, manufacture, or distribution of manufacturer's
implant.  82 F.3d 894.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Regardless of whether chapter 387 can form the basis of a
Parnar action, Hawaii law indicated that appellants (ramp supervisor and ramp
agent who contended that they were terminated by airline in connection with
ramp supervisor's wage and hour complaint, in violation of public policy)  had
not produced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on such a claim,
even if it did exist.  281 F.3d 1054.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' argument that since manufacturer improperly used
defendant's trademark, and defendant failed to prevent this improper use,
defendant was liable for alleged defective nature of implant, rejected.  844 F.
Supp. 590.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff could not prevail on false imprisonment claim,
where defendant police officer and defendant resident manager had probable
cause to arrest plaintiff for harassment.  855 F. Supp. 1167.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's motion to dismiss count regarding tortious
interference with contract denied, where defendant alleged that a director or
officer may not be liable for tortiously interfering with corporation's
contract unless the director or officer acted solely for personal benefit;
plaintiffs stated a claim for tortious interference with contract.  895 F.
Supp. 1365.</p>

claims for assault and battery preempted by Airlines Deregulation Act.  905 F.

interference with contract had any factual basis.  920 F. Supp. 1080.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff's claim for tortious interference with contractual
relations and business (containing separate torts of tortious interference with
contractual relations and tortious interference with a prospective business
advantage) failed as a matter of law.  190 F. Supp. 2d 1192.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff's claim for damages resulting from defendants'
allegedly tortious interference with plaintiff's contractual relations with its
customers was preempted, where any determination of the applicability of state
tort law would require consideration of the scope of various provisions of the
collective bargaining agreement between plaintiff and defendant union; even if
the claim were not preempted, it would still be dismissed.  250 F. Supp. 2d
1244.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Preemption by Fair Credit Reporting Act of plaintiff's
defamation and negligence claims against furnishers of credit information and
consumer reporting agencies, discussed.  293 F. Supp. 2d 1167.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff asserted viable claims against defendants
under 42 U.S.C. §1981, Title VII, and chapter 378, and each of the statutes
provided a sufficient remedy such that the court did not need to fashion any
further remedy under the public policy exception, defendants' motion for
partial summary judgment granted on plaintiff's claim for violation of public
policy.  322 F. Supp. 2d 1101.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Count of plaintiff's complaint sounding in common law
wrongful termination in violation of public policy failed to state a claim;
there could be no statutorily-based Parnar common law claims where, as with the
federal Pregnancy Discrimination and Family and Medical Leave Acts, the
statutes themselves provided comprehensive remedial schemes to vindicate their
public policies.  324 F. Supp. 2d 1144.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' spoliation claims failed as a matter of law,
where plaintiffs based their spoliation claims on the destruction of plants
from the alleged Costa Rica field test; destruction of the plants did not
result in plaintiffs' inability to prove the underlying cases.  330 F. Supp. 2d
1101.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant, an outside auditor hired by pension plan trustees,
was entitled to summary judgment as to plaintiff's negligence and negligent
misrepresentation claims, where plaintiff was, at most, an incidental
beneficiary of defendant's audit and plaintiff's reliance, if any, was not
justified.  433 F. Supp. 2d 1181.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Summary judgment denied, where there was a genuine issue of
material fact as to each of the factors of intentional interference and proper
justification of the tortious interference with prospective contractual

state a claim of fraud by omission.  488 F. Supp. 2d 1071.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under Restatement of Tort, Agency, or Restitution,
counterclaim defendant may be liable for substantially or intentionally
assisting or colluding with other counterclaim defendant (OCD) to breach OCD's
fiduciary duty to counterclaimants that arose from OCD's role as their agent. 
488 F. Supp. 2d 1071.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' motion for summary judgment granted as to
plaintiff's common law claim for retaliation in violation of state public
policy, where, inter alia, the public policy exception under Parnar was not
applicable to plaintiff, who was not an at-will employee.  490 F. Supp. 2d
1062.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Assault aboard ship.  2 H. 255; 29 H. 564.  Wilful
negligence.  30 H. 12.  Public contractor.  31 H. 296.  Landlord, tenant and

H. 68, 384 P.2d 308; 47 H. 329, 388 P.2d 214.  Operator of bathing pools, duty

<p class=XNotes>  Liability of one who voluntarily undertakes a course of
conduct intended to induce another to engage in an action.  58 H. 502, 573 P.2d
107.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellants' state tort claims for false arrest, false
imprisonment, and malicious prosecution failed as a matter of law because
appellants did not contest the preliminary hearing determination of probable
cause and their commitment to circuit court for trial.  Appellants failed to
cite to any persuasive or relevant authority in support of their contention
that where actions or inactions of the prosecutor subsequent to a preliminary
hearing &quot;erodes&quot; probable cause, an action for false arrest, false
imprisonment, or malicious prosecution arises.  76 H. 219, 873 P.2d 98.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendants-appellants brought interference with
contract claim against plaintiff-appellee, there was no evidence that
plaintiff-appellee intentionally induced [third party] to breach agreement with
defendants-appellants, and defendants-appellants failed to prove damages
resulting from the alleged breach.  78 H. 40, 890 P.2d 277.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Claimant not precluded by exclusivity provision of §386-5
from seeking common law tort remedies against employer's insurer where injuries
allegedly caused by insurer's denial of medical benefits and disability
payments not &quot;work injuries&quot; within scope of chapter 386.  83 H. 457,
927 P.2d 858.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In the context of construction litigation regarding the
alleged negligence of design professionals, a tort action for negligent
misrepresentation alleging damages based purely on economic loss is not
available to a party in privity of contract with a design professional;
recovery limited to contract remedies.  87 H. 466, 959 P.2d 836.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Hawaii law does not recognize tortious breach of contract
actions in the employment context.  89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Tort recovery, including recovery of punitive damages, is not
allowed under Hawaii law for breach of contract in the absence of conduct that
(1) violates a duty that is independently recognized by principles of tort law
and (2) transcends the breach of the contract.  89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff's claims did not arise under chapter 386, the
exclusive remedy and original jurisdiction provisions in the workers'
compensation statute did not apply, and where plaintiff's claims for relief of
tortious conduct on the part of workers' compensation insurer were not within
the original jurisdiction of the labor director, trial court erred in granting
summary judgment on that basis.  90 H. 407, 978 P.2d 845.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Conspiracy to commit tortious interference with prospective
business advantage between certain &quot;common purpose&quot; defendant
corporations and also officer/shareholder of those corporations; claim failed
for insufficient evidence.  91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Tortious interference with prospective business advantage
recognized; elements.  91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court's summary judgment in favor of accountant on
appellants' negligence claim for accountant malpractice proper where appellants
were incidental, not intended, beneficiaries of the relationship between
accountant and client.  95 H. 247, 21 P.3d 452.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court's summary judgment in favor of accountant on
appellants' third party beneficiary negligence claim for accountant malpractice
proper where appellants were incidental, not intended, beneficiaries of the
implied contract between accountant and client.  95 H. 247, 21 P.3d 452.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' claim of having spent three to five dollars on
gasoline in reliance upon car dealership's advertisement, which they alleged
was intended to induce them to visit dealership's lot for the purpose of
purchasing an automobile, was a showing of sufficient damages for purposes of
maintaining a negligent misrepresentation claim; court thus erred in granting
summary judgment in favor of dealership on the basis that plaintiffs' damages
were inadequate.  98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The three to five dollars plaintiffs claimed having spent on
gasoline responding to car dealership's advertisement, if proved, satisfied the
requirement of &quot;substantial pecuniary  loss&quot; necessary to support a
claim for relief grounded in fraud.  98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State employees' retirement system board has a fiduciary duty
to provide its members with clear, understandable information concerning retirement
benefits; where failure to do so in case may have resulted in retiree's
unilateral mistake with respect to retiree's chosen mode of retirement and,
additionally, constituted negligent misrepresentation, case remanded to board. 
108 H. 212, 118 P.3d 1155.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Union shop steward's claims for abuse of process were
preempted by the National Labor Relations Act where, given the circumstances of
the case, the State's interest in protecting its citizens from abusive use of
the courts and in policing its own court system were insufficient to override
the federal labor scheme.  109 H. 520, 128 P.3d 833.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Union shop steward's claim for false light invasion of
privacy was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act where the
National Labor Relations Board in an unfair labor practice proceeding would
focus on the effect of the alleged acts on steward's association with the labor
union while a state court would focus on infringement of the steward's right to
privacy, and the interests of an individual in securing his or her privacy is a
primary state concern.   109 H. 520, 128 P.3d 833.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  If plaintiff's claims that ranch tour guide failed to
reasonably supervise the equine activities that were the proximate cause of
plaintiff's injury were correct, the presumption of non-negligence set forth in
§663B-2 would not apply; thus it was error for trial court to apply §663B-2 to
the case.  111 H. 254, 141 P.3d 427.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where complaint asserted that an actual, ongoing prospective
economic relationship existed between the physician-plaintiff/members and their
patients; members expected a reasonable future economic benefit from that
relationship; by requiring members to enter into participating physician
agreements, defendant was aware or should have been reasonably aware of their
expectancy of a future economic benefit; defendant maliciously and
intentionally disrupted their relationships with their patients by delaying,
denying, and  reducing reimbursement; and such disruption imposed serious
financial hardships upon the members, thereby causing damage.  Plaintiffs
satisfied the rudimentary pleading requirement for their claims of tortious
interference with prospective economic advantage.  113 H. 77, 148 P.3d 1179.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In complaints alleging intentional interference with contractual
relations and prospective economic advantage, tortuous inducement of breach of
fiduciary duty and tortuous interference with contractual relations, where
there were no allegations that indicated that lawyers &quot;possessed a desire
to harm which is independent of the desire to protect their clients&quot;, and
the complaints were devoid of any allegations that the lawyers &quot;acted for
personal gain or with ill-will towards&quot; plaintiffs, lawyers' management of
the inspection and review process of plaintiff's books and records fell within
the purview of the litigation privilege.  113 H. 251, 151 P.3d 732.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant lawyers' conduct at issue occurred during a
quasi-judicial proceeding (arbitration), notwithstanding the fact that the
proceeding was temporarily stayed, litigation privilege was applicable to
appeal.  113 H. 251, 151 P.3d 732.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A homeowner may pursue a negligence claim against a builder
where it is alleged that the builder has violated an applicable building code,
despite the fact that the homeowner suffered only economic losses; thus,
association of apartment owners' negligence claims based on violations of the
uniform building code were not barred by the economic loss rule.  115 H. 232,
167 P.3d 225.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where law firm's actions as an employer and law firm were not
inconsistent and law firm's status as an employer and law firm involved a
single legal entity for purposes of the &quot;dual persona&quot; doctrine,
trial court did not err in granting law firm's motion to dismiss terminated
attorney's negligent investigation claim.  117 H. 92, 176 P.3d 91.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where §386-5 unambiguously provides that claims for
infliction of emotional distress or invasion of privacy are not subject to the
exclusivity provision when such claims arise from claims for sexual harassment
or sexual assault, in which case a civil action may be brought, and plaintiff
alleged a claim for emotional distress (negligent investigation) that did not
arise out of sexual harassment or sexual assault, such claim was, pursuant to
§386-5, barred.  117 H. 92, 176 P.3d 91.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where loan broker did not present evidence showing that bank
pursued an improper objective of harming broker or used wrongful means that
caused injury in fact, trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in
favor of bank on broker's tortious interference with prospective business
advantage claim.  109 H. 35 (App.), 122 P.3d 1133.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Without evidence of an act of intentional inducement, loan
broker had no basis for its claim that bank tortiously interfered with broker's
contractual relationship with borrower; evidence merely of a breached contract
was insufficient to sustain a tortious interference with contractual relations
claim; thus, trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of
bank on broker's tortious interference with contractual relations claim.  109
H. 35 (App.), 122 P.3d 1133.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sale by real estate broker of client's property to a party in
which broker had pecuniary interest without disclosure to client was
constructive fraud.  2 H. App. 188, 628 P.2d 214.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  False imprisonment.  2 H. App. 655, 638 P.2d 383.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sellers' brokers not entitled as a matter of law to a
judgment that they were not liable to buyer for tort of negligent
misrepresentation.  6 H. App. 188, 716 P.2d 163.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where public policy against terminating employee solely
because employee suffered a compensable work injury is evidenced in §378-32 and
remedy is available under §378-35, judicially created claim of wrongful
discharge in violation of public policy could not be maintained.  87 H. 57
(App.), 951 P.2d 507.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A plaintiff alleging the tort of interference with
prospective contractual relations must plead and prove six elements.  87 H. 394
(App.), 957 P.2d 1076.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under circumstances of case, defendant's communication of
information to prospective employer's manager was privileged because it was
truthful; thus, defendant could not be held liable as a matter of law for any
alleged intentional interference with plaintiff's prospective employment
contract with prospective employer.  87 H. 394 (App.), 957 P.2d 1076.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Allowance of intrafamily tort suits in Hawaii does not
constitute a public policy which may be used to invalidate household exclusion
clauses in a homeowner's policy.  87 H. 430 (App.), 958 P.2d 552.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In a tort case, the payment of the prevailing defendant's
costs by the prevailing defendant's insurer pursuant to the insurance policy is
not a valid reason for the trial court to decide not to order the losing
plaintiff to pay the costs reasonably incurred by the prevailing defendant. 
102 H. 119 (App.), 73 P.3d 73.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As Hawaii generally does not apply the theory of an implied
warranty of habitability to commercial leases, and plaintiff's sublease was a
commercial sublease without any special clause, plaintiff's claim on this basis
was correctly adjudicated.  104 H. 500 (App.), 92 P.3d 1010.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Miscellaneous.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  In class action brought against major cigarette
manufacturers, tobacco trade associations, and the industry's public relations
firm, first amended complaint asserted violations of federal RICO statutes;
Hawaii's RICO statute, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>'</span>842-2;
federal antitrust statutes; Hawaii's antitrust act, chapter 480; various state
common-law torts; and false advertising under <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>'</span>708-871;
defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim granted, where
injuries alleged by plaintiffs trust funds in first amended complaint were not
direct; even if remoteness doctrine did not bar claims, claims failed for other

sue in assumpsit.  11 H. 270.</p>
