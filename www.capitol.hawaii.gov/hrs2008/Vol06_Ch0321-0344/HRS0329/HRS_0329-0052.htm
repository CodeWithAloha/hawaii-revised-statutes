<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §329-52  Administrative inspections and
warrants.</b>  (a)  Issuance and execution of administrative inspection
warrants shall be as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A judge of the circuit court, or any district
judge within the judge’s jurisdiction, and upon proper oath or affirmation
showing probable cause, may issue warrants for the purpose of conducting
administrative inspections authorized by this chapter or rules hereunder, and
seizures of the property appropriate to the inspections.  For purposes of the
issuance of administrative inspection warrants, probable cause exists upon
showing a valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this chapter or
rules hereunder, sufficient to justify administrative inspection of the area,
premises, building or conveyance in the circumstances specified in the
application for the warrant;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A warrant shall issue only upon an affidavit of a
designated officer or employee having knowledge of the facts alleged, sworn to
before the judge and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant.  If the
judge is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is
probable cause to believe they exist, the judge shall issue a warrant
identifying the area, premises, building, or conveyance to be inspected, the
purpose of the inspection, and, if appropriate, the type of property to be
inspected, if any.  The warrant shall:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  State the grounds for its issuance and the
name of each person whose affidavit has been taken in support thereof;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Be directed to a person authorized by
section 329-51 to execute it;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Command the person to whom it is directed
to inspect the area, premises, building, or conveyance identified for the
purpose specified and, if appropriate, direct the seizure of the property
specified;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  Identify the item or types of property to
be seized, if any;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  Direct that it be served during normal
business hours and designate the judge to whom it shall be returned;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A warrant issued pursuant to this section must be
executed and returned within ten days of its date unless, upon a showing of a
need for additional time, the court orders otherwise.  If property is seized
pursuant to a warrant, a copy shall be given to the person from whom or from
whose premises the property is taken, together with a receipt for the property
taken.  The return of the warrant shall be made promptly, accompanied by a
written inventory of any property taken.  The inventory shall be made in the
presence of the person executing the warrant and of the person from whose
possession or premises the property was taken, if present, or in the presence
of at least one credible person other than the person executing the warrant.  A
copy of the inventory shall be delivered to the person from whom or from whose
premises the property was taken and to the applicant for the warrant;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The judge who has issued a warrant shall attach
thereto a copy of the return and all papers returnable in connection therewith
and file them with the chief clerk of the judicial circuit in which the
inspection was made.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The department of public safety may make
administrative inspections of controlled premises in accordance with the
following provisions:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  For purposes of this section only, “controlled
premises” means:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Places where persons registered or
exempted from registration requirements under this chapter are required to keep
records; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Places including factories, warehouses,
establishments, and conveyances in which persons registered or exempted from
registration requirements under this chapter are permitted to hold,
manufacture, compound, process, sell, deliver, or otherwise dispose of any
controlled substance.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  When authorized by an administrative inspection
warrant issued pursuant to subsection (a) an officer or employee designated by
the department of public safety, upon presenting the warrant and appropriate
credentials to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, may enter controlled
premises for the purpose of conducting an administrative inspection.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  When authorized by an administrative inspection
warrant, an officer or employee designated by the department of public safety
may:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Inspect and copy records required by this
chapter to be kept;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Inspect, within reasonable limits and in a
reasonable manner, controlled premises and all pertinent equipment, finished
and unfinished material, containers and labeling found therein, and, except as
provided in subsection (b)(5), all other things therein, including records,
files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities bearing on violation of this
chapter; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Inventory any stock of any controlled
substance therein and obtain samples thereof.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  This section does not prevent the inspection
without a warrant of books and records pursuant to an administrative subpoena
issued in accordance with law, nor does it prevent entries and administrative
inspections, including seizures of property, without a warrant:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  If the owner, operator, or agent in charge
of the controlled premises consents;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  In situations presenting imminent danger
to health or safety;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  In situations involving inspection of
conveyances if there is reasonable cause to believe that the mobility of the
conveyance makes it impracticable to obtain a warrant;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  In any other exceptional or emergency
circumstance where time or opportunity to apply for a warrant is lacking; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  In all other situations in which a warrant
is not constitutionally required.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  An inspection authorized by this section shall
not extend to financial data, sales data, other than shipment data, or pricing
data unless the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the controlled premises
consents in writing. [L 1972, c 10, pt of §1; gen ch 1985; am L 1990, c 281,
