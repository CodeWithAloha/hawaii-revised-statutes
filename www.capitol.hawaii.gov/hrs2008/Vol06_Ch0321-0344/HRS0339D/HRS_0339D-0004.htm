<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§339D-4]  Manufacturer responsibility.</b> 
(a)  Beginning October 1, 2009, each manufacturer shall label all new covered
electronic devices to be offered for sale for delivery in this State with a
brand, which label shall be permanently affixed and readily visible.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (b)  (1)  By January 1, 2009, each manufacturer of new
covered electronic devices offered for sale for delivery in this State shall
register with the department and pay to the department a registration fee of
$5,000.  Thereafter, if a manufacturer has not previously registered, the
manufacturer shall register with the department prior to any offer for sale for
delivery in this State of the manufacturer's new covered electronic devices.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Each manufacturer who is registered shall submit
an annual renewal of its registration with the payment of a registration fee of
$5,000, by January 1 of each program year.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The registration and each renewal shall include a
list of all of the manufacturer's brands of covered electronic devices and
shall be effective on the second day of the succeeding month after receipt by
the department of the registration or renewal.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  By June 1, 2009, and annually thereafter,
each manufacturer shall submit a plan to the department to establish, conduct,
and manage a program for the collection, transportation, and recycling of its
covered electronic devices sold in the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  By March 31, 2011, and annually
thereafter, each manufacturer shall submit to the department the total weight
of all covered electronic devices recycled in the previous year, which may
include both a manufacturer's own covered electronic devices and those of other
manufacturers.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  By July 1, 2011, and annually thereafter,
the department shall publish a ranking of all manufacturers selling covered
electronic devices in the State, based upon the annual total weight of covered
electronic devices recycled by each manufacturer in the previous year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The State may adopt regulations allowing a
procurement preference based upon a manufacturer's ranking.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The department shall review each
manufacturer's plan and, within sixty days of receipt of the plan, shall
determine whether the plan complies with this chapter.  If the plan is
approved, the department shall notify the manufacturer or group of
manufacturers.  If the plan is rejected, the department shall notify the
manufacturer or group of manufacturers and provide the reasons for the plan's
rejection.  Within thirty days after receipt of the department's rejection, the
manufacturer or group of manufacturers may revise and resubmit the plan to the
department for approval.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The obligations under this chapter for a
manufacturer who manufactures or manufactured covered electronic devices, or
who sells or sold covered electronic devices manufactured by others, under a
brand that was previously used by a different person in the manufacture of
covered electronic devices, shall extend to all covered electronic devices
bearing that brand.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  Nothing in this chapter is intended to
exempt any person from liability that the person would otherwise have under
applicable law. [L Sp 2008, c 13, pt of §2]</p>
