<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  L 2004, c 241, §13 provides:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;SECTION 13.  Unless modified hereafter pursuant to
chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the following definition shall supersede
the current definition of &quot;recycling drop-off facility&quot; as it appears
in title 11, chapter 58.1, Hawaii Administrative Rules:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Recycling drop-off facility&quot; means a structure or
site designated for collection and small scale (low technology) segregation of
recyclable materials.  The staffed or unstaffed site will receive and
temporarily store &quot;dropped-off&quot; recyclable materials.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sixty-eight-fluid-ounce deposit beverage containers.  L 2007,
c 285, §§11 and 12 provide:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;SECTION 11.  The department of health shall phase-in
all requirements affecting the redemption of sixty-eight-fluid-ounce
containers, beginning December 1, 2007, as follows; provided that the phase-in
shall be completed by March 1, 2008:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-45.0pt'>  (1) From
December 1, 2007, distributors of deposit beverage containers may begin marking
sixty-eight-fluid-ounce deposit beverage containers as required under section
[342G-112(a)], Hawaii Revised Statutes;</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-45.0pt'>  (2) From
December 1, 2007, until March 1, 2008, a sixty-eight-fluid-ounce deposit
beverage container may be redeemed under the deposit beverage container
program, without regard to whether the container bears the refund value of the
container and the word &quot;Hawaii&quot; or the letters &quot;HI&quot;,
required by section 342G&#8209;112(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes;</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-45.0pt'>  (3) Beginning
March 1, 2008, every deposit beverage container holding up to sixty-eight fluid
ounces and sold in the State shall be marked as required under section
342G-112(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes; and</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-45.0pt'>  (4) Beginning
March 1, 2008, only deposit beverage containers meeting the requirements of section
342G&#8209;112(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall be eligible for redemption.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  SECTION 12.  (a)  The legislature finds that the public
interest in protecting the environment takes precedence over the delay in
implementation of redemption of sixty-eight-fluid-ounce beverage containers
under this Act.  The legislature finds that the redemption rate is below the
balance of the deposit beverage container deposit special fund.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  (b)  The department of health shall reimburse a redemption
center, from the deposit beverage container deposit special fund, the refund
values paid to a redeemer, as defined in section 342G-101, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, for sixty-eight-fluid-ounce containers redeemed between December 1,
2007, and March 1, 2008, pursuant to section 11 of this Act; provided that a
redemption center shall provide collection reports under section 342G-119,
Hawaii Revised Statutes, for the sixty-eight-fluid-ounce beverage
containers.&quot;</p>
