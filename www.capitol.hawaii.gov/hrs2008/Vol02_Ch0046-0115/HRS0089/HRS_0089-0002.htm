<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Revision Note</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Numeric designations deleted and definitions rearranged.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Cost items are those that require new or additional
appropriation for implementation.  Att. Gen. Op. 72-10.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Dates upon which plaintiffs were paid not a &quot;cost
item&quot; as that term is defined in this section.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Impasse&quot; means failure after good-faith
negotiations.  56 H. 85, 528 P.2d 809.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Though designated as an &quot;incumbent&quot; employee,
plaintiff was &quot;essential employee&quot; where plaintiff:  (1) received
notice by same means as essential employee; (2) was prohibited from striking;
and (3) was subject to discipline for not working if scheduled to work during a
strike.  87 H. 191, 953 P.2d 569.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that bargaining over
pay dates was one of the core subjects of collective bargaining that triggers a
violation of article XIII, §2 of the Hawaii constitution, and failed to provide
the supreme court with their collective bargaining agreement to support their contention
that pay dates are bargainable, and these pay dates were not specifically
incorporated into their contract, the Act 355, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997
amendment to §78-13 to unilaterally alter the &quot;traditional practice&quot;
of being paid on the fifteenth day and last day of the month did not violate
their right to collectively bargain pay periods.  111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.</p>
