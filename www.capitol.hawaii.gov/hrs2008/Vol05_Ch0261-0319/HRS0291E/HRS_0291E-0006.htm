<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§291E-6  Ignition interlock devices; certification.]</b> 
<i>[Section effective July 1, 2010.] </i> (a)  The director of transportation
shall establish and administer a statewide program relating to certification
and monitoring of ignition interlock devices installed pursuant to chapter 291E
or 804 and the vendors who install and maintain them.  </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The program shall include standards and
procedures for the certification of ignition interlock devices installed
pursuant to chapter 291E or 804.  At a minimum, the standards shall require
that the devices:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Be certified by a nationally recognized
certification organization to meet or exceed all standards and specifications
provided as guidelines by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
&quot;Nationally recognized certification organization&quot; means a testing
laboratory or analytical chemist not affiliated with a manufacturer of ignition
interlock devices that is qualified to test ignition interlock devices or
reference samples and is approved by the United States Department of
Transportation.  The nationally recognized certification organization must be
able to administer performance tests of an ignition interlock device or a
sample provided by the vendor;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Operate using an alcohol-specific sensor technology;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Employ a digital camera by which a photograph of
the person using the device can be incorporated into the electronic record
generated by each use of the device;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Require a rolling retest by which the driver
must, within a specified period of time or distance driven after starting the
vehicle, be retested and found to have an alcohol concentration of less than
.02, with a margin of error of .01; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Generate a record of vehicle usage, including
dates, times, and distances driven.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The program shall include standards and
procedures for the certification for vendors who install and maintain ignition
interlock devices pursuant to chapter 291E or 804.  At a minimum, the standards
shall require that vendors:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Install only an ignition interlock device that is
certified pursuant to this section;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Offer or contract for ignition interlock device
installation and maintenance statewide;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Train drivers who are required to install an
ignition interlock device, pursuant to chapter 291E or 804, in how to use the
device;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Schedule the driver for all necessary readings
and maintenance of the device; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Provide periodic reports regarding the use of
each ignition interlock device installed pursuant to chapter 291E or 804,
including incidents of test failure, attempts to circumvent the device, and
dates, times, and distances the vehicle was driven.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Each vendor who sells or installs an
ignition interlock device pursuant to chapter 291E or 804 shall be certified
annually by the director of transportation pursuant to this section and the
rules adopted thereunder.  The vendor shall pay a certification fee to the
director of transportation who shall deposit the fee into the ignition
interlock special fund established pursuant to section 291E-5.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The director of transportation shall adopt
rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary for the purposes of this section. [L
2008, c 171, pt of §2]</p>
