appropriate treatment if the counselor's assessment establishes the offender's
substance abuse or dependence.  All costs for assessment and treatment shall be
borne by the offender.</p>

contrary, whenever a court revokes a person's driver's license pursuant to this
section, the examiner of drivers shall not grant to the person a new driver's
license until the expiration of the period of revocation determined by the
court.  After the period of revocation is completed, the person may apply for

conducted pursuant to section 291E-11.  The court shall order the person to
make restitution in a lump sum, or in a series of prorated installments, to the
police department or other agency incurring the expense of the blood or urine

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The requirement to provide proof of
financial responsibility pursuant to section 287-20 shall not be based upon a
sentence imposed under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  As used in this section, the term
&quot;examiner of drivers&quot; has the same meaning as provided in section
286-2. [L 2000, c 189, pt of §23; am L 2001, c 157, §25; am L 2002, c 160, §11;

device if the defendant is gainfully employed in a position that requires
driving and the defendant will be discharged if prohibited from driving a
vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock device.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A request made pursuant to subsection (d)
shall be accompanied by:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A sworn statement from the defendant containing
facts establishing that the defendant currently is employed in a position that
requires driving and that the defendant will be discharged if prohibited from
driving a vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock device; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A sworn statement from the defendant's employer
establishing that the employer will, in fact, discharge the defendant if the
defendant is prohibited from driving a vehicle not equipped with an ignition
interlock device and identifying the specific vehicle and hours of the day, not
to exceed twelve hours per day, the defendant will drive for purposes of
employment.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  A permit issued pursuant to subsection (d)
shall include restrictions allowing the defendant to drive:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Only during specified hours of employment, not to
exceed twelve hours per day, and only for activities solely within the scope of
the employment;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>     (2)  Only the
vehicle specified; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Only if the permit is kept in the defendant's
possession while operating the employer's vehicle.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Notwithstanding any other law to the
contrary, any:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Conviction under this section, section 291E-4(a),
or section 291E-61.5;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Conviction in any other state or federal
jurisdiction for an offense that is comparable to operating or being in
physical control of a vehicle while having either an unlawful alcohol
concentration or an unlawful drug content in the blood or urine or while under
the influence of an intoxicant or habitually operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Adjudication of a minor for a law violation that,
if committed by an adult, would constitute a violation of this section or an
offense under section 291E-4(a), or section 291E-61.5;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>shall be considered a prior conviction for the
purposes of imposing sentence under this section.  Any judgment on a verdict or
a finding of guilty, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or an adjudication,
in the case of a minor, that at the time of the offense has not been expunged
by pardon, reversed, or set aside shall be deemed a prior conviction under this
section.  No license and privilege suspension or revocation shall be imposed
pursuant to this section if the person's license and privilege to operate a
vehicle has previously been administratively revoked pursuant to part III for the
same act; provided that, if the administrative suspension or revocation is
subsequently reversed, the person's license and privilege to operate a vehicle
shall be suspended or revoked as provided in this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Whenever a court sentences a person pursuant
to subsection (b), it also shall require that the offender be referred to the
driver's education program for an assessment, by a certified substance abuse
counselor, of the offender's substance abuse or dependence and the need for
appropriate treatment.  The counselor shall submit a report with
recommendations to the court.  The court shall require the offender to obtain
appropriate treatment if the counselor's assessment establishes the offender's
substance abuse or dependence.  All costs for assessment and treatment shall be
borne by the offender.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  Upon proof that the defendant has
installed an ignition interlock device in the defendant's vehicle pursuant to
subsection (b), the court shall issue an ignition interlock permit that will
allow the defendant to drive a vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock
device during the revocation period.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  Notwithstanding any other law to the
contrary, whenever a court revokes a person's driver's license pursuant to this
section, the examiner of drivers shall not grant to the person a new driver's
license until the expiration of the period of revocation determined by the
court.  After the period of revocation is completed, the person may apply for
and the examiner of drivers may grant to the person a new driver's license.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  Any person sentenced under this section
may be ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of any blood or urine tests
conducted pursuant to section 291E-11.  The court shall order the person to
make restitution in a lump sum, or in a series of prorated installments, to the
police department or other agency incurring the expense of the blood or urine
test.  Except as provided in section 291E-5, installation and maintenance of
the ignition interlock device required by subsection (b) shall be at the
defendant's own expense.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (l)  The requirement to provide proof of
financial responsibility pursuant to section 287-20 shall not be based upon a
sentence imposed under subsection (b)(1).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (m)  As used in this section, the term
&quot;examiner of drivers&quot; has the same meaning as provided in section
286-2. [L 2000, c 189, pt of §23; am L 2001, c 157, §25; am L 2002, c 160, §11;
am L 2003, c 71, §3; am L 2004, c 90, §12; am L 2005, c 33, §1 and c 194, §1;
am L 2006, c 201, §7; am L 2007, c 198, §4; am L 2008, c 171, §§8, 16 and c
231, §17]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As to the description of the offense, this section, which
relates to operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant,
substantially reenacted §291-4.4, which pertained to the offense of habitually
driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.  106 H. 480, 107
P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where indictment charged defendant under §291-4.4, the
statute that was in effect at the time of defendant's arrest, there was no ex
post facto problem.  106 H. 480, 107 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the five-year time period omitted from the oral charge
was a critical part of the subsection (b)(2) attendant circumstance, especially
in light of defendant's several prior DUI convictions, the oral charge was
defective and defendant's oral motion to dismiss should have been granted.  112
H. 269 (App.), 145 P.3d 812.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because a prior conviction, as described in subsection (b)(2)
(2003), is an elemental attendant circumstance, intrinsic to the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, it was necessary that
defendant's prior conviction be alleged in the charging instrument and proven
at trial  as preconditions to defendant's present conviction of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant for the second time within five
years, in violation of subsections (a) and (b)(2) (2003).  114 H. 227, 160 P.3d
703.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Considerations of due process continue to require that the
aggravating factors set forth in subsection (b)  all of which remain &quot;attendant
circumstances that are intrinsic to and 'enmeshed' in the hierarchy of offenses
that this section as a whole describes&quot;  be alleged in the charging
instrument and proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.  114 H. 227, 160 P.3d
703.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The 2003 amendment to this section transformed subsection
(b)(1) to (3) into status offenses.  114 H. 227, 160 P.3d 703.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where complaint charging defendant with a violation of this
section was silent with respect to the attendant circumstance of any prior
conviction, complaint was insufficient as a matter of law in charging a
violation of subsections (a) and (b)(2) (2003).  114 H. 227, 160 P.3d 703.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although prosecution's oral charge failed to adequately set
forth the essential elements of the offense described by subsections (a) and
(b)(2) (2004), absent the phrase &quot;for your second offense&quot;, the
prosecution's oral charge set forth the essential elements of the included
offense described by subsections (a) and (b)(1) (2004); thus, as record
contained sufficient evidence that defendant committed the offense of operating
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant under subsections (a) and (b)(1)
(2004), case remanded for entry of judgment and resentencing under subsections
(a) and (b)(1) (2004).  114 H. 411, 163 P.3d 1148.</p>
