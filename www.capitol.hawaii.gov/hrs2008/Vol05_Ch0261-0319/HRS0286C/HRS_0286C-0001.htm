The Driver License Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all
other jurisdictions legally joining herein in the form substantially as
follows:</p>

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (a)  The party states find that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The safety of their streets and highways is
materially affected by the degree of compliance with state laws and local
ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence
that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of
persons and property.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The continuance in force of a license to drive is
predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation
of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  It is the policy of each of the party
states to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances and
administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles
by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive
motor vehicles.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to
drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the
overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules
and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any
license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a
motor vehicle in any of the party states.</p>

Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted; describe the violation
specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated; identify the
court in which action was taken; indicate whether a plea of guilty [or not
guilty was entered, or the conviction was a result] of the forfeiture of bail,

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (a)  The licensing authority in the home state,
for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to
operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported,
pursuant to Article III of this compact, as it would if such conduct had
occurred in the home state, in the case of convictions for:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from
the operation of a motor vehicle;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence

drug to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor
vehicle;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any felony in the commission of which a motor
vehicle is used;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Failure to stop and render aid in the event of a
motor vehicle accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  As to other convictions, reported pursuant
to Article III, the licensing authority in the home state shall give such
effect to the conduct as is provided by the laws of the home state.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the laws of a party state do not
provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the
words employed in subdivision (a) of this Article, such party state shall
construe the denominations and descriptions appearing in subdivision (a) hereof
as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a
substantially similar nature, and the laws of such party state shall contain
such provision as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is
given to this Article.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

APPLICATIONS FOR NEW LICENSES</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Upon application for a license to drive, the
licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether applicant has ever
held, or is the holder of a license to drive issued by any other party state. 
The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue
a license to drive to the applicant if:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The applicant has held such a license, but the
same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if
such suspension period has not terminated.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The applicant has held such a license, but the
same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if
such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of one
year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application
for a new license if permitted by law.  The licensing authority may refuse to
issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing
authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the
privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The applicant is the holder of a license to drive
issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders
such license.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'>ARTICLE VI. 
APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Except as expressly required by provisions of
this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right
of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to the licenses to
drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver
license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a
nonparty state.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (a)  The head of the licensing authority of
each party state shall be the administrator of this compact for his state.  The
administrators, acting jointly, shall have the power to formulate all necessary
and proper procedures for the exchange of information under this compact.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The administrator of each party state

VIII.  ENTRY INTO FORCE AND WITHDRAWAL</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

become effective as to any state when it has enacted the same into law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Any party state may withdraw from this
compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall
take effect until six months after the executive head of the withdrawing state
has given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party
states.  No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by the
licensing authorities of states remaining party to the compact of any report of
conviction occurring prior to the withdrawal.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'>ARTICLE IX. 
CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     This compact shall be liberally construed so as
to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this compact shall be
severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is
declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United
States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance
is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall
not be affected thereby.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the
constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force
and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the
state affected as to all severable matters. [L 1971, c 127, §4]</p>
