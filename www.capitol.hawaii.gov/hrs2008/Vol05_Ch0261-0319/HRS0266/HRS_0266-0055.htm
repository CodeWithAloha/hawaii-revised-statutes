<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §266</b>-<b>55  Special facility revenue
bonds.</b>  All special facility revenue bonds, including special facility
revenue refunding bonds, authorized to be issued shall be issued pursuant to
part III of chapter 39, except as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  No such revenue bonds shall be issued unless at
the time of issuance the department shall have entered into a special facility
lease with respect to the special facility for which such revenue bonds are to
be issued.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Such revenue bonds shall be issued in the name of
the department, and not in the name of the State.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  No further authorization of the legislature shall
be required for the issuance of the special facility revenue bonds, but the
approval of the governor shall be required for such issuance.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from
and secured solely by the revenues derived by the department from the special
facility for which they are issued, as defined in section 266-51(1).</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The final maturity date of such revenue bonds
shall not be later than either the estimated life of the special facility for
which they are issued or the initial term of the special facility lease.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  If deemed necessary or advisable by the
department, or to permit the obligations of the other person to the special
facility lease to be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933,
the department with the approval of the state director of finance may appoint a
national or state bank within or without the State to serve as trustee for the
holders of the revenue bonds and may enter into a trust indenture or trust
agreement with such trustee.  The trustee may be authorized by the department
to collect, hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility
for which the revenue bonds are issued and to apply such revenues to the
payment of the principal and interest on such revenue bonds.  In the event that
any such trustee shall be appointed, any trust indenture or agreement entered
into by the department with the trustee may contain the covenants and provisions
authorized by part III of chapter 39 to be inserted in a resolution adopted or
certificate issued, as though the words &quot;resolution&quot; or
&quot;certificate&quot; as used in that part read &quot;trust indenture or
agreement&quot;.  Such covenants and provisions shall not be required to be
included in the resolution or certificate authorizing the issuance of the
revenue bonds if included in the trust indenture or agreement.  Any resolution
or certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement adopted, issued, or entered
into by the department pursuant to this part may also contain any provisions
required for the qualification thereof under the United States Trust Indenture
Act of 1939.  The department may pledge and assign to the trustee the special
facility lease and the rights of the department including the revenues
thereunder.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  If the department with the approval of the state
director of finance shall have appointed or shall appoint a trustee for the
holders of the revenue bonds, then notwithstanding the second sentence of
section 39-68 the director of finance may elect not to serve as fiscal agent
for the payment of the principal and interest, and for the purchase,
registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, of the revenue bonds, or may
elect to limit the functions the director shall perform as such fiscal agent. 
The department with the approval of the director of finance may appoint the
trustee to serve as such fiscal agent, and may authorize and empower the
trustee to perform such functions with respect to such payment, purchase,
registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, as the department may deem
necessary, advisable, or expedient, including, without limitation, the holding
of the revenue bonds and coupons which have been paid, and the supervision and
destruction thereof in accordance with sections 40-10 and 40-11.  Nothing in
this paragraph shall be a limitation upon or be construed as a limitation upon
the powers granted in the preceding paragraph to the department with the
approval of the director of finance to appoint the trustee, or granted in
sections 36-3 and 39-13 and the third sentence of section 39-68 to the director
of finance to appoint the trustee or others, as fiscal agents, paying agents,
and registrars for the revenue bonds or to authorize and empower such fiscal
agents, paying agents, and registrars to perform the functions referred to in
such paragraph and sections, it being the intent of this paragraph to confirm
that the director of finance as aforesaid may elect not to serve as fiscal agent
for the revenue bonds or may elect to limit the functions the director shall
perform as such fiscal agent, as the director of finance may deem necessary,
advisable, or expedient.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  The department may sell such revenue bonds either
at public or private sale.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  If no trustee shall be appointed to collect,
hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility for which
such revenue bonds are issued, such revenues shall be held in a separate
account in the treasury of the State, separate and apart from the harbor
special fund, to be applied solely to the carrying out of the resolution,
certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement authorizing or securing such
revenue bonds.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  If the resolution, certificate, trust indenture,
or trust agreement shall provide that no revenue bonds issued thereunder shall
be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless certified or authenticated by the
trustee for the holders of such revenue bonds, signatures of the officers of
the State upon such bonds and the coupons thereof as required by section 39-56
may be evidenced by their facsimile signatures.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  The proceeds of such revenue bonds may be used
and applied by the department to reimburse the other person to the special
facility lease for all preliminary costs and expenses, including architectural
and legal costs.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (12)  If the special facility lease shall require the
other person to operate, maintain, and repair the special facility which is the
subject of such lease, at the other person's expense, such requirement shall
constitute compliance by the department with section 39-61(a)(2), and none of
the revenues derived by the department from such special facility shall be
required to be applied to the purposes of section 39-62(2).  Sections 39-62(4),
39-62(5), and 39-62(6) shall not be applicable to the revenues derived from a
special facility lease. [L 1980, c 126, pt of §2; am L 1993, c 2, §3 and c 212,
§3]</p>
