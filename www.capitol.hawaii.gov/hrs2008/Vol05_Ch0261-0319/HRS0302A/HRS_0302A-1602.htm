cost to construct a school, including without limitation planning, design,
engineering, grading, permits, construction, and construction and project
management, but not including the cost to acquire land.  The intent of the school
impact fee calculation is that new developments should not be charged for a
higher level of service than is being provided to existing developments.  A
reasonable measure of the level of service is the percentage of classrooms that
are in permanent structures, as opposed to portable buildings.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Cost per student&quot; means the
construction cost for a school per student (actual school construction cost
divided by enrollment capacity).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Cost/unit&quot; means the impact fee for
school construction (land and construction).</p>

new residential projects involving rezoned properties or parcels, current zoned

built by the developer), and include condominiums, additional dwelling units as
defined by each county, and subdivisions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Owner&quot; means the owner of record of
real property or the owner's agent.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Proportionate share&quot; means the pro rata

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Recent school construction averages&quot;
means the department's historical average acres required and enrollment
capacity for elementary (K-5), middle (6-8), and high (9-12) schools.  Based on

acres</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Revenue credit&quot; means the state
general tax revenues under chapter 237 that will be generated by the new
residential unit and used to fund school capital facilities and pay for
outstanding debt on existing facilities.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;School facilities&quot; means the
facilities owned or operated by the department, or the facilities included in
the department of education capital budget or capital facilities plan.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;School impact district&quot; means a
geographic area designated by the board where anticipated growth will create
the need for one or more new schools or the expansion of one or more existing

new housing units within the area.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;School impact fee: construction cost

rate from the project.</p>

dwelling unit not connected to any other dwelling unit, or a detached building
containing two dwelling units.</p>

residential development has matured and enrollment no longer fluctuates, or
achieves a steady state. [L 2007, c 245, pt of §2]</p>
