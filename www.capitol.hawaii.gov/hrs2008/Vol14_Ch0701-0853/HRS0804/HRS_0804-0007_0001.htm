subsection (b) and except as provided in subsection (d), when the defendant is
charged with an offense under section 291E-61, except an offense for which the
defendant would be sentenced pursuant to section 291E-61(b)(1), the court shall
order as a condition of <span style='color:black'>release on</span> bail,
recognizance, or supervised release that, within fifteen days, the defendant
install an ignition interlock device, as defined in section 291E-1, on any

a vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device during the period of the
defendant's release on bail, recognizance, or supervised release.</p>

contrary, the court shall not issue an ignition interlock permit to:</p>

installation and maintenance of the ignition interlock device required by
subsection (c) shall be at the defendant's own expense. [L 1978, c 217, pt of

<p class=XNotes>  Where restrictions imposed by the trial court were a
condition of defendant's bail, defendant's argument that prohibition was
overbroad, vague, ambiguous and therefore unconstitutional, was unpersuasive
and restrictions imposed were well within the discretion of the trial court.
