<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §712-1216</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 712-1216(1) provides that engagement in the act of
promoting pornography, generally or for minors, is prima facie evidence that
the actor did so with knowledge of the character and content of the material
disseminated or performance produced, presented, directed, participated in,
exhibited, or to be exhibited.  The subsection addresses itself to a special
prosecutorial problem.  Since §§712-1214 and 1215 require knowledge on the
promoter's part of the character and content of the pornography which the
promoter promotes, the prosecution is required to prove, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that the defendant knew of the character and content of the pornographic
material or performance.  However in such cases there is often little evidence
of the actor's knowledge of such facts.  A recent work in this area has
underlined this difficulty quite well:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>       How does one
prove (beyond a reasonable doubt) what moves in the recesses of another's
mind?  How does one show that a bookseller knows the items in his stock, that a
theater owner is familiar with the movies he exhibits, or that a newsdealer is
aware of the general character of the magazines he displays?  Aside from those
dubious dialogues in which a dealer says how &quot;hot&quot; is his merchandise--
conversations most unlikely to take place when the purchaser is a
fifteen-year-old--scienter, realistically viewed is rarely susceptible of sure
proof.  But common sense may assist.  No corner hardware merchant would long
prosper, lacking general familiarity with the items he had for sale...
similarly, honest book and magazine dealers have some general knowledge of the
character of the wares they order, put on their shelves, sometimes display and
ultimately hope to sell.  The draft statute would transmute this common sense
into law....[1]</p>

<p class=XNotes>With this reasoning in mind, subsection (1) allows the
prosecution to get its case to the jury on the issue of the actor's knowledge
of character and content of the material, film, or performance on proof of the
specified conduct only.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Much the same evidentiary problem, difficulty in proving mens
rea, is presented when the age of another person is made an element of the
offense, as is the case in §712-1215.  Section 712-1216(2) provides the same
prima facie rule with respect to age that subsection (1) provides with respect
to the nature of the material or performance.  Again, the evidentiary rule
merely permits the prosecution to get the case to the trier of fact on that
issue:  the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt remains on the
prosecution.  In such situations, the defendant would be free to introduce, but
would not be obligated to do so, any evidence tending to negate the inference
that the defendant knew the minor's age.  In this vein, the minor's appearance,
the minor's representations, and apparently official identification records
(e.g., a birth certificate, driver's license, or draft card) would all be
relevant factors.</p>
