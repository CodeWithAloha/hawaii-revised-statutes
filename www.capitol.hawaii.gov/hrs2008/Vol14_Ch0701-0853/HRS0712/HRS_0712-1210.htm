<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §712-1210</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 106, Session Laws 1981, added the definition of
&quot;community standards,&quot; to mean a statewide standard.  It also amended
the definitions of &quot;pornographic&quot; and &quot;pornographic to
minors.&quot;  The conference committee stated in its report (Senate Conference
Committee Report No. 14 and House Conference Committee Report No. 12) that the
amendments were merely to conform the definitions to the holdings of the United
States Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) and the Hawaii
Supreme Court in State v. Manzo, 58 Haw. 440 (1978).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 240, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by adding
definitions to comport with sexual exploitation of a minor offenses created by
the Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 10, Session Laws 2005, amended this section by repealing
the superfluous definition of &quot;sexual conduct&quot; added by Act 240,
Session Laws 2002.  This section already provided a sufficient definition of
&quot;sexual conduct&quot;.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1281.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Grand jury was presented with sufficient information to
determine the existence of probable cause that material distributed to minor by
defendant was pornographic for minors under paragraph (7)(a).  82 H. 474, 923
P.2d 891.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Based on the plain language and legislative history of
§707-700 and construing the definition of &quot;sexual contact&quot; with
reference to other definitions relating to sexual relations in §707-700 and
this section, contact with the interior of the mouth constitutes &quot;touching
of intimate parts&quot; under the definition of &quot;sexual contact&quot; in
§707-700.  108 H. 279, 118 P.3d 1222.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Pornographic.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Construed; provision not unconstitutional for overbreadth or
void for vagueness.  58 H. 440, 573 P.2d 945.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Material held to be &quot;utterly without redeeming social
value.&quot;  63 H. 418, 629 P.2d 1130.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Cited:  413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607.</p>
