<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§88-122  Determination of employer normal
cost and accrued liability contributions.</b>  (a)  Based on regular interest
and such mortality and other tables as are adopted by the board of trustees,
the actuary engaged by the board, on the basis of successive annual actuarial
valuations, shall determine the employer's normal cost and accrued liability
contributions for each fiscal year beginning July 1 separately for the
following two groups of employees:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Police officers, firefighters, and corrections
officers; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  All other employees.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The actuarial valuations made for years
after June 30, 1999, shall be based on an eight per cent investment yield rate,
assumed salary increases of four per cent, and tables, contribution rates, and
factors adopted by the board or legislature for actuarial valuations of the
system, subject to recommendations made by the actuary appointed under section
88-29.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  With respect to each of the two groups of
employees in subsection (a), the normal cost for each year after June 30, 1994,
shall be the percentage of the aggregate annual compensation of employees as of
March 31 of the valuation year as determined by the actuary using the entry age
normal cost funding method.  On each June 30 the board shall determine the allocation
of the assets of the pension accumulation fund between the two groups of
employees in subsection (a); provided that the assets of the pension
accumulation fund as of June 30, 1976, shall be allocated between the two
groups in the same proportion as the aggregate annual compensation of each
group as of March 31, 1976.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Commencing with fiscal year 1994-1995 and
each subsequent fiscal year, the actuary shall determine the total unfunded
accrued liability using the entry age normal cost funding method separately for
each of the two groups of employees in subsection (a).  The accrued liability
contribution for each of the two groups of employees shall be the annual
payment required to liquidate the unfunded accrued liability over a period of
twenty-nine years beginning July 1, 2000.  Any increase or decrease in the
total unfunded accrued liability resulting from legislative changes in the
benefit provisions of the employees' retirement system shall be liquidated over
a period of time to be determined by the actuary.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Commencing with fiscal year 2005-2006 and
each subsequent fiscal year, the employer contributions for normal cost and
accrued liability for each of the two groups of employees in subsection (a)
shall be based on fifteen and three-fourths per cent of the member's
compensation for police officers, firefighters, and corrections officers and
thirteen and three-fourths per cent of the member's compensation for all other
employees.  The contribution rates shall amortize the total unfunded accrued
liability of the entire plan over a period not to exceed thirty years.  The
contribution rates shall be subject to adjustment:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  If the actual period required to amortize the
unfunded accrued liability exceeds thirty years;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  If the actual period required to amortize the
unfunded accrued liability falls below the established benchmark funding period
of twenty-five years; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Based on the actuarial investigation conducted in
accordance with section 88-105. [L 1925, c 55, pt of §8; am imp L 1927, c 251,

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;SECTION 8.  Act 212, Session Laws of Hawaii 1994, as
amended by Act 216, Session Laws of Hawaii 2000, is amended by amending section
4 to read as follows:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;SECTION 4.  The board of trustees of the employees'
retirement system shall make payments with respect to all eligible employees
who retire pursuant to this Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The board shall determine:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-45.0pt'>  (1) The amount
equal to the actuarial present value of the difference between the allowances
members receive after the receipt of service credit under this Act and the
allowances members would have received without the two years of additional
service credit; and</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-45.0pt'>  (2) The
portion of the additional actuarial present value of benefits to be charged to
the State and to each county, based on retirements during the early retirement
incentive bonus period.</p>

<p class=XNotes>The State and counties shall make separate additional payments
to the employees' retirement system in the amounts required to liquidate the
additional actuarial present value of benefits over a period of five years
beginning July 1, 1997; provided that the State's and counties' separate
payments under this Act shall be recalculated so as to liquidate the
outstanding balance of each employer's additional actuarial present value of
benefits as of June 30, 1997, over the period of time specified in section
88-122(d), Hawaii Revised Statutes; provided further that the State's and
counties' payments under this Act remaining as of June 30, 2005, shall be
included in employer contributions for normal cost and accrued liability as
specified in section 88-122(e), Hawaii Revised Statutes.&quot;</p>
