<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The allowance to which the member was entitled
under the retirement allowance option selected when the member previously retired
and which was suspended; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  For the period of service during the member's
reemployment, the allowance to which the member is entitled for that service
based on the retirement allowance option initially selected and computed for
the member's age, average final compensation, and other factors in accordance
with the benefit formula of a class H member in existence at the time of the
member's final retirement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Any retirant who retired under part VIII
and returns to service requiring membership in the system as a class A or class

allowance shall be the sum of:</p>

under the retirement allowance option selected when the member previously
retired and which was suspended; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  For the period of service during the member's
reemployment, the allowance to which the member is entitled for that service
based on the retirement allowance option initially selected and computed for
the member's age, average final compensation, and other factors in accordance
with the benefit formula of a class A or class B member in existence at the
time of the member's final retirement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Any retirant who received the special

suspended;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Forfeit the special retirement incentive benefit
and any related benefit provided by chapter 88; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Be subject to the age and service requirements
under section 88&#8209;331 when the member again retires.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If a retirant's designation of beneficiary
was irrevocable upon the retirant's initial retirement, the retirant may not
change the retirant's designated beneficiary when the retirant returns to
service or when the former retirant again retires.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The board shall adopt any rules as may be
