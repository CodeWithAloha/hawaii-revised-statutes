<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§88-121.5]  Power to enter into security
loan agreements.</b>  Anything in this part to the contrary notwithstanding,
the board of trustees may enter into an agreement or agreements with a
financially responsible stock or bond brokerage firm, bank, or similar
financial institution (&quot;borrower&quot;) authorized to do business under
the laws of any state or the United States, for the purpose of lending to the
borrower securities held by the system, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The securities shall be loaned to the borrower
for a period not to exceed one year;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  At the termination of the loan period, the
borrower shall deliver to the board of trustees certificates for identical
securities which are of the same class and issue as the loaned securities;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  For the protection of the system, the borrower
shall deliver to the board of trustees or its agent, collateral in the form of
cash, letters of credit, bonds, or other interest-bearing notes and obligations
of the United States or federal instrumentalities which are eligible for
investment by the board of trustees, in an amount not less than one hundred two
per cent of the market value of the loaned securities, as determined by the
board of trustees.  The system shall have a security interest in the collateral
to secure borrower's obligations under the agreement.  The board of trustees
shall not be obligated to return the collateral or any part thereof to the
borrower, except upon borrower's delivery to the board or its agent of
securities identical to the loaned securities, as provided in paragraph (2). 
The board of trustees or its designated agent shall monitor the market value of
the loaned securities daily, and if, on any business day, the amount of the
collateral deposited by the borrower is less than one hundred two per cent of
the market value of the loaned securities on that day, the borrower shall
immediately deposit with the board or its agent additional collateral in the
form of cash, letters of credit, bonds, or other interest-bearing notes and
obligations of the United States or federal instrumentalities which are
eligible for investment by the board of trustees.  Such additional collateral,
together with the collateral previously on deposit, shall be in an amount not
less than one hundred two per cent of the market value of the loaned securities
at the time of such deposit;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The board of trustees, at its election, may use
or invest any collateral delivered by a borrower to the board or its agent
pursuant to the agreement, and any income and profits earned on the collateral
shall be retained for the benefit of the system.  Any investment of the
collateral shall be subject to section 88-119;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Until the termination of the loan, the borrower
may exercise all the incidents of ownership of loaned securities, including the
right to transfer the loaned securities to others and vote or otherwise consent
as a holder of such securities; provided that the borrower shall be obligated
to the board of trustees for all dividends and distributions made with respect
to the loaned securities during the period of the agreement, including, without
limitation, cash, stock or property dividends or distributions, interest
payments, and subscription rights;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  In the event that the borrower, at the
termination of the loan period, fails to deliver to the board of trustees
certificates for identical securities which are of the same class and issue as
the loaned securities, the borrowers shall forfeit to the system the collateral
deposited. [L 1981, c 212, §1]</p>
