169, §43.]</i>  Any member, except for a member described in subsection (c),
who is in service on June 30, 2006, or who returns to service after June 30,
2006, and has vested benefit status in accordance with section 88-96(b), may
elect to become a class H member effective July 1, 2006, or upon return to
service, by filing an election form with the system in accordance with this
section.  The election shall be made prior to April 1, 2006, by members in
service on February 28, 2006; provided that any member in service on February
28, 2006, who is absent from the State on that date while in the military
service of the United States, shall have thirty days after the member returns
to the member's regular employment with the State or a county to make the
election.  The election shall be made by members entering or returning to
service from March 1, 2006, through June 30, 2006, within sixty days of
entering or returning to service.  The election shall be made by members
entering or returning to service after June 30, 2006, within thirty days of
entering or returning to service.  The election shall be irrevocable.</p>

class A or class B member who received a refund of contributions picked up and
paid by the member's employer pursuant to section 88-46(b), the member may not

and who does not return to service as a class A or class B member, shall become
a class H member upon return to service and the member's credited service as a
class A or B member shall be converted to class C credited service.  The system
shall return to the member the member's accumulated contributions if the member's
accumulated contributions are $1,000 or less at the time of distribution.  If
the member's accumulated contributions for the class A or B credited service
that was converted to class C credited service are greater than $1,000 and the
member does not make written application, contemporaneously with the member's
return to service, for return of such contributions, the member, except as
provided by section 88-341, may not withdraw the member's accumulated
contributions for the class A or B credited service that was converted to class
C credited service until the member retires or attains age sixty-two.</p>
