<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §46-15.2  Housing; additional county powers.</b> 
In addition and supplemental to the powers granted to counties by section
46-15.1, any county shall have and may exercise any of the following powers:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To provide assistance and aid to persons of low
and moderate income in acquiring housing by providing loans secured by a
mortgage, including by acquiring such loans from private lenders for which such
county has made advance commitment to acquire such loans, and to make and
execute contracts with private lenders or a public agency for the origination
and servicing of such loans and pay the reasonable value of such services;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  In connection with the exercise of any powers
granted under this section or section 46-15.1, to establish one or more loan
programs and to issue bonds under chapter 47 or 49 to provide moneys to carry
out the purposes of this section or section 46-15.1; provided that:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  If bonds are issued pursuant to chapter 47
to finance one or more loan programs, the county may establish such qualifications
as it deems appropriate;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  If bonds are issued pursuant to chapter 49
to finance one or more loan programs, such loan program or programs shall
comply with the provisions of part III.B of chapter 201G;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  If bonds are issued pursuant to section
47-4 or chapter 49, any loan program established pursuant to this section or
any county-owned dwelling units constructed under section 46-15.1 shall be and
constitute an &quot;undertaking&quot; under section 49-1 and the provisions of
chapter 49 shall apply to such loan program or county-owned dwelling units to
the extent applicable;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  In connection with the establishment of
any loan program pursuant to this section, a county may employ financial
consultants, attorneys, real estate counselors, appraisers, and such other
consultants as may be required in the judgment of the county and fix and pay
their compensation from funds available to the county therefor;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  Notwithstanding any limitation otherwise
established by law, with respect to the rate of interest on any loan made under
any loan program established pursuant to this section, such loan may bear such
rate or rates of interest per year as the county shall determine; provided no
loan made from the proceeds of any bonds of the county shall be under terms or
conditions which would cause the interest on such bonds to be deemed subject to
income taxation by the United States of America;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (F)  Notwithstanding any limitation otherwise
established by law, with respect to the amount of compensation permitted to be
paid for the servicing of loans made under any loan program established
pursuant to this section, a county may fix such reasonable compensation as the
county may determine;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (G)  Notwithstanding the requirement of any
other law, a county may establish such separate funds and accounts with respect
to bonds issued pursuant to chapter 47 or 49 to provide moneys to carry out the
purposes of this section or section 46-15.1 as such county may deem
appropriate;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (H)  Notwithstanding any provision of chapter
47 or 49 or of any other law, but subject to the limitations of the State
Constitution, bonds issued to provide moneys to carry out the purposes of this
section or section 46-15.1 may be sold at public or private sale at such price,
may bear interest at such rate or rates per year, may be payable at such time
or times, may mature at such time or times, may be made redeemable before
maturity at the option of the county, the holder, or both, at such price or
prices and upon such terms and conditions, and may be issued in coupon or
registered form, or both, all as the county may determine;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (I)  If deemed necessary or advisable, the
county may designate a national or state bank or trust company within or
without the State to serve as trustee for the holders of bonds issued to
provide moneys to carry out the purposes of this section or section 46-15.1 and
enter into a trust indenture, trust agreement, or indenture of mortgage with
such trustee whereby such trustee may be authorized to receive and receipt for,
hold, and administer the proceeds of such bonds and to apply the proceeds to
the purposes for which such bonds are issued, or to receive and receipt for,
hold, and administer the revenues and other receipts derived by the county from
the application of the proceeds of such bonds and to apply such revenues and
receipts to the payment of the principal of, or interest on such bonds, or
both.  Any such trust indenture, trust agreement, or indenture of mortgage
entered into with the trustee may contain any covenants and provisions as may
be deemed necessary, convenient, or desirable by the county in order to secure
such bonds.  The county may pledge and assign to the trustee any agreements
related to the application of the proceeds of such bonds and the rights of the
county thereunder, including the rights to revenues and receipts derived
thereunder.  Upon appointment of the trustee, the director of finance may elect
not to serve as fiscal agent for the payment of the principal and interest, and
for the purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, of such
bonds, or may elect to limit the functions the director of finance performs as
such fiscal agent, and may appoint the trustee to serve as the fiscal agent,
and may authorize and empower the trustee to perform such functions with
respect to such payment, purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and
redemption, as the director of finance deems necessary, advisable, or
expedient, including, without limitation, the holding of such bonds and coupons
which have been paid and the supervision and conduction or the destruction
thereof in accordance with law;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (J)  If a trustee is not appointed to collect,
hold, and administer the proceeds of bonds issued to provide moneys to carry
out the purposes of this section or section 46-15.1, or the revenues and
receipts derived by the county from the application of the proceeds of such
bonds, all as provided in subparagraph (I), the director of finance of such
county may hold such proceeds or revenues and receipts, as the case may be, in
a separate account in the treasury of the county, to be applied solely to the
carrying out of the ordinance, trust indenture, trust agreement, or indenture
of mortgage, if any, authorizing or securing such bonds; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (K)  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding
the investment of funds held in reserves and sinking funds related to bonds
issued to provide moneys to carry out the purposes of this section or section
46-15.1 shall comply with the provisions of section 201G-167; provided that any
investment which requires approval by the county council pursuant to section
46-48 or 46-50 must first be approved by the county council.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  To acquire such policies of insurance and enter
into such banking arrangements as such county may deem necessary in order to
better secure bonds issued to provide money to carry out the purposes of this
section or section 46-15.1 including, without limitation, contracting for a
support facility or facilities as may be necessary with respect to bonds issued
with a right of the holders to put such bonds and contracting for interest rate
swaps; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  To do any and all other things necessary or
appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers granted in
section 46-15.1 and this section. [L 1982, c 284, §1; am L 1983, c 156, §1; am
L 1987, c 80, §2; am L 1990, c 34, §4; am L 1997, c 350, §7]</p>
