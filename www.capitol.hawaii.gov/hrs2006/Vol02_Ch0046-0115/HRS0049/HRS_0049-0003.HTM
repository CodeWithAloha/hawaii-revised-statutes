<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §49-3  Additional powers of counties.</b> 
In addition to the powers which it may now have, any county under this chapter
may:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Construct, acquire by gift, purchase, or the
exercise of the right of eminent domain, reconstruct, improve, better, or
extend any undertaking, within or without the county, or partially within or
partially without the county, and acquire by gift, purchase, or the exercise of
the right of eminent domain, lands or rights in land or water rights in
connection therewith or undertake the establishment and administration of a
loan program as authorized by the law;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Operate and maintain any undertaking and maintain
a loan program as authorized by law and furnish the services, facilities, and
commodities thereof for its own use and for the use of public and private
consumers within or without the territorial boundaries of the county;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Issue its revenue bonds to finance in whole or in
part the cost of the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction,
improvement, betterment or extension of any undertaking or the establishment
and administration of any loan program as authorized by law;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Impose, prescribe, and collect rates, rentals,
fees and charges for the use and services of, and the facilities and
commodities furnished by, the undertaking or the use and services of the loan
program as authorized by law, as provided in section 49-10; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Pledge to the punctual payment of the revenue
bonds and interest thereon or covenant to pay into any special funds from which
any revenue bonds may be payable, all or any portion of the revenue of the
undertaking or loan program or of any part thereof, or the user taxes derived
therefrom, or any combination of both (including improvements, betterments, or
extensions thereto thereafter constructed or acquired) sufficient, among other
things, to pay the revenue bonds and interest thereon as the same shall become
due and create and maintain reasonable reserves therefor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The governing body of the county in determining
the cost may include all costs and estimated costs of the issuance of the
revenue bonds, all architectural, engineering, inspection, financial and legal
expenses, all costs of establishing or administering a loan program authorized
by law, the cost of causing the payment of the principal or interest or both of
the revenue bonds to be insured or guaranteed, the initial cost of any support
facility obtained as permitted by section 49-8, and interest which it is
estimated will accrue on the bonds during the construction or origination
period and for six months thereafter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Subject to the approval of the governing body,
a board may exercise all or any part of the powers vested in the county
pursuant to this chapter but only with respect to an undertaking or loan
program under the jurisdiction of such board.  In the event a board shall
exercise any of the powers vested in the county pursuant to this chapter, the
term governing body as used in this chapter shall be deemed to mean the board,
and the term director of finance shall be deemed to mean the chief financial
officer of the board. [L 1989, c 80, pt of §3]</p>
