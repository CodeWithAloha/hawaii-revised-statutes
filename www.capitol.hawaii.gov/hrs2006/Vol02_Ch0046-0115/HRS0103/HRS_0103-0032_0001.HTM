that if progress is not satisfactory, the contracting officer may continue to
withhold as retainage, sums not exceeding five per cent of the amount due the
contractor; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The retainage shall not include sums deducted as
liquidated damages from moneys due or that may become due the contractor under
the contract.</p>

authorized to do business in this State;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any other form of collateral acceptable to the

until June 30, 2007, see above.] </i> (a)  Any retainage provided for in this
section or requested to be withheld by the contractor shall be held by the

who subcontract work to other subcontractors.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  This section shall not be construed to
impair the right of a contractor or a subcontractor at any tier to negotiate,
and to include in their subcontract, provisions that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Permit the contractor or subcontractor to retain,
without cause, a specified percentage of no more than ten per cent of each
progress payment otherwise due to a subcontractor for satisfactory performance
under the subcontract, without incurring any obligation to pay a late payment
interest penalty, in accordance with terms and conditions agreed to by the
parties to the subcontract, giving such recognition as the parties deem
appropriate to the ability of a subcontractor to furnish a performance bond and
a payment bond, subject however, to the limitations of subsection (d); and </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Permit the contractor or subcontractor to make a
determination that part or all of the subcontractor's payment request may be

specifying the following:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The amount to be withheld;</p>

to the procurement officer that the subcontractor is entitled to the payment of
such amount.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The provisions of this section shall not
be construed to require payment to subcontractors of retainage released to a
contractor pursuant to an agreement entered into with the procurement officer
meeting the requirements of section 10332.2. [L 1976, c 167, pt of §1; am L
1999, c 149, §7; am L 2000, c 222, §2; am L 2006, c 291, §3]</p>
