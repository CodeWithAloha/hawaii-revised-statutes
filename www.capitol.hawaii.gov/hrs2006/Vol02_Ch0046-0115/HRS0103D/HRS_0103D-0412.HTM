<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §103D-412  Energy-efficient vehicles.</b> 
(a)  The procurement policy for all agencies purchasing or leasing motor
vehicles shall be to obtain energy-efficient vehicles.  All covered fleets are
directed to procure increasing percentages of energy-efficient vehicles as part
of their annual vehicle acquisition plans, which shall be as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  In the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2006, at
least twenty per cent of newly purchased light-duty vehicles acquired by each
covered fleet shall be energy-efficient vehicles;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  In the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, at
least thirty per cent of newly purchased light-duty vehicles acquired by each
covered fleet shall be energy-efficient vehicles;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  In the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008, at
least forty per cent of newly purchased light-duty vehicles acquired by each
covered fleet shall be energy-efficient vehicles; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  For each subsequent fiscal year, the percentage
of energy-efficient vehicles newly purchased shall be five percentage points
higher than the previous year, until at least seventy-five per cent of each
covered fleet's newly purchased, light-duty vehicles are energy-efficient
vehicles.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  For the purposes of this section:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Agency&quot; means a state agency,
office, or department.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Alternative fuel&quot; has the same
meaning as contained in 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 490.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Covered fleet&quot; has the same meaning
as contained in 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 490 Subpart C.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Energy-efficient vehicle&quot; means a
vehicle that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Is capable of using an alternative fuel;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Is powered primarily through the use of an
electric battery or battery pack that stores energy produced by an electric
motor through regenerative braking to assist in vehicle operation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Is propelled by power derived from one or more
cells converting chemical energy directly into electricity by combining oxygen
with hydrogen fuel that is stored on board the vehicle in any form;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Draws propulsion energy from onboard sources of
stored energy generated from an internal combustion or heat engine using
combustible fuel and a rechargeable energy storage system; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Is on the list of &quot;Most Energy Efficient
Vehicles&quot; in its class or is in the top one-fifth of the most
energy-efficient vehicles in its class available in Hawaii as shown by vehicle
fuel efficiency lists, rankings, or reports maintained by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Excluded vehicles&quot; has the same
meaning as provided in 10 Code of Federal Regulations Section 490.3.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Light-duty vehicle&quot; has the same
meaning as contained in 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 490.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Agencies may offset energy-efficient
vehicle purchase requirements by successfully demonstrating percentage
improvements in overall light-duty vehicle fleet mileage economy.  The offsets
shall be measured against the fleet average miles per gallon of petroleum-based
gasoline and diesel fuel, using the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2006, as a
baseline, on a percentage-by-percentage basis.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Agencies that use biodiesel fuel may
offset the vehicle purchase requirements of this section at the rate of one
vehicle for each four hundred fifty gallons of neat biodiesel fuel used.  Neat
biodiesel fuel is one hundred per cent biodiesel (B100) by volume.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Agencies may apply to the chief
procurement officer for exemptions from the requirements of this section to the
extent that the vehicles required by this section are not available or do not
meet the specific needs of the agency.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Vehicles acquired from another state agency
and excluded vehicles are exempt from the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Nothing in this section is intended to
interfere with an agency's ability to comply with federally-imposed vehicle
purchase mandates such as those required by 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part
490 Subpart C. [L 2005, c 216, §2; am L 2006, c 96, §28]</p>
