provision is made for the issuance of income debenture certificates, interest
shall be paid by the redevelopment corporation on income debenture certificates

of dividends if there were no income debentures.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  A provision that, so long as the provisions of
this part regulating redevelopment corporations remain applicable to any

expenses, taxes, and assessments, there shall be paid annually out of the
earnings of the redevelopment corporation, after providing for all expenses,
taxes, assessments, and depreciation on improvements, or, in the case of a
lease, for amortization, a sum equal to but not exceeding eight per cent of the
total actual final cost of the projects as defined by [paragraph] (2) of

cumulative, and any deficiency in interest, amortization, depreciation, and

corporation, be paid into the redevelopment fund of the agency.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (14)  A declaration that, upon the dissolution of the
corporation pursuant to subsection (a) of section 53-36, the property may be
