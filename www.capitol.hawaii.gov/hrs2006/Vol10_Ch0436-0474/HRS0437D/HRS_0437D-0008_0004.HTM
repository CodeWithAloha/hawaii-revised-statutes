<i>[Repeal and reenactment on December 31, 2022.  L 2005, c 247, §9(3).]</i> 
(a)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a lessor may visibly pass on to a
lessee:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The general excise tax attributable to the transaction;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The vehicle license and registration fee and
weight taxes, prorated at 1/365th of the annual vehicle license and
registration fee and weight taxes actually paid on the particular vehicle being
rented for each full or partial twenty-four hour rental day that the vehicle is
rented; provided the total of all vehicle license and registration fees charged
to all lessees shall not exceed the annual vehicle license and registration fee
actually paid for the particular vehicle rented;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The rental motor vehicle surcharge tax as
provided in section 251-2 attributable to the transaction;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The county surcharge on state tax under section
46&#8209;16.8; provided that the lessor itemizes the tax for the lessee; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The rents or fees paid to the department of
transportation under concession contracts, negotiated pursuant to chapter 102,
or service permits, granted pursuant to title 19, Hawaii Administrative Rules,

contract or service permit;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  The lessor submits to the department of

verified by a certified public accountant as correct, that reports the amounts
of the rents or fees paid to the department of transportation pursuant to the
applicable concession contract or service permit:</p>

charged to lessees:</p>

<p class=iClause>              (i)  For all airport locations;</p>

<p class=iClause>             (ii)  For each airport location; and</p>

<p class=1ParagraphContd>          The respective departments, in their sole
discretion, may extend the time to submit the statement required in this

examiner for evaluating, investigating, and verifying compliance with this
subsection, as well as additional amounts for travel, per diem, mileage, and
other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the examination, which
shall relate solely to the requirements of this subsection, and which shall be
billed by the departments as soon as feasible after the close of the
examination.  The cost per hour shall be $40 or as may be established by rules
adopted by the director.  The lessor shall pay the amounts billed within thirty
days following the billing.  All moneys collected by the director shall be

mandatory or that it is a government assessment upon the consumer shall be a
per se violation of section 480-2. [L 1997, c 140, §1; am L 1999, c 223, §3; am
L 2005, c 247, §6]</p>
