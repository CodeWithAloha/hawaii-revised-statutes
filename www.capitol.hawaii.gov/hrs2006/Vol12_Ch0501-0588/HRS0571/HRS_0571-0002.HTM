<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant, a non-custodial parent, was acting within the
defendant's court-prescribed unsupervised visitation time, defendant retained,
as a &quot;residual parental right&quot;, within the meaning of this section,
the authority to discipline defendant's child with respect to that child's
conduct during the visitation period; thus, defendant was a &quot;parent&quot;
for purposes of §703-309(1).  90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The &quot;physical harm&quot; encompassed in the definition
of family violence in this section would not preclude a parent's right to use
force to discipline a child as permitted by §703-309(1), and duty to discipline
a child under §577-7(a).  88 H. 200 (App.), 965 P.2d 133.</p>
