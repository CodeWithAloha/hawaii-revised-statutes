<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§571-46  Criteria and procedure in awarding
custody and visitation.</b>  In the actions for divorce, separation, annulment,
separate maintenance, or any other proceeding where there is at issue a dispute
as to the custody of a minor child, the court, during the pendency of the
action, at the final hearing, or any time during the minority of the child, may
make an order for the custody of the minor child as may seem necessary or
proper.  In awarding the custody, the court shall be guided by the following
standards, considerations, and procedures:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Custody should be awarded to either parent or to
both parents according to the best interests of the child, and the court may
also consider frequent, continuing, and meaningful contact of each parent with
the child unless the court finds that a parent is unable to act in the best
interest of the child; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Custody may be awarded to persons other than the
father or mother whenever the award serves the best interest of the child.  Any
person who has had de facto custody of the child in a stable and wholesome home
and is a fit and proper person shall be entitled prima facie to an award of
custody;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  If a child is of sufficient age and capacity to
reason, so as to form an intelligent preference, the child's wishes as to
custody shall be considered and be given due weight by the court;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Whenever good cause appears therefor, the court
may require an investigation and report concerning the care, welfare, and
custody of any minor child of the parties.  When so directed by the court,
investigators or professional personnel attached to or assisting the court
shall make investigations and reports which shall be made available to all
interested parties and counsel before hearing, and the reports may be received
in evidence if no objection is made and, if objection is made, may be received
in evidence; provided the person or persons responsible for the report are
available for cross-examination as to any matter that has been investigated;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The court may hear the testimony of any person or
expert, produced by any party or upon the court's own motion, whose skill,
insight, knowledge, or experience is such that the person's or expert's
testimony is relevant to a just and reasonable determination of what is for the
best physical, mental, moral, and spiritual well-being of the child whose
custody is at issue;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Any custody award shall be subject to
modification or change whenever the best interests of the child require or
justify the modification or change and, wherever practicable, the same person
who made the original order shall hear the motion or petition for modification
of the prior award;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Reasonable visitation rights shall be awarded to
parents, grandparents, siblings, and any person interested in the welfare of the
child in the discretion of the court, unless it is shown that rights of
visitation are detrimental to the best interests of the child;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to
represent the interests of the child and may assess the reasonable fees and
expenses of the guardian ad litem as costs of the action, payable in whole or
in part by either or both parties as the circumstances may justify;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  In every proceeding where there is at issue a
dispute as to the custody of a child, a determination by the court that family
violence has been committed by a parent raises a rebuttable presumption that it
is detrimental to the child and not in the best interest of the child to be
placed in sole custody, joint legal custody, or joint physical custody with the
perpetrator of family violence.  In addition to other factors that a court must
consider in a proceeding in which the custody of a child or visitation by a
parent is at issue, and in which the court has made a finding of family
violence by a parent:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  The court shall consider as the primary
factor the safety and well-being of the child and of the parent who is the
victim of family violence;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The court shall consider the perpetrator's
history of causing physical harm, bodily injury, or assault or causing
reasonable fear of physical harm, bodily injury, or assault to another person;
and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  If a parent is absent or relocates because
of an act of family violence by the other parent, the absence or relocation
shall not be a factor that weighs against the parent in determining custody or
visitation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  A court may award visitation to a parent who
committed family violence only if the court finds that adequate provision can
be made for the physical safety and psychological well-being of the child and
for the safety of the parent who is a victim of family violence;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  In a visitation order, a court may:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Order an exchange of a child to occur in a
protected setting;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Order visitation supervised by another
person or agency;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Order the perpetrator of family violence
to attend and complete, to the satisfaction of the court, a program of
intervention for perpetrators or other designated counseling as a condition of
the visitation;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  Order the perpetrator of family violence
to abstain from possession or consumption of alcohol or controlled substances
during the visitation and for twenty-four hours preceding the visitation;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  Order the perpetrator of family violence
to pay a fee to defray the costs of supervised visitation;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (F)  Prohibit overnight visitation;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (G)  Require a bond from the perpetrator of
family violence for the return and safety of the child.  In determining the
amount of the bond, the court shall consider the financial circumstances of the
perpetrator of family violence;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (H)  Impose any other condition that is deemed
necessary to provide for the safety of the child, the victim of family
violence, or other family or household member; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (I)  Order the address of the child and the
victim to be kept confidential;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (12)  The court may refer but shall not order an adult
who is a victim of family violence to attend, either individually or with the
perpetrator of the family violence, counseling relating to the victim's status
or behavior as a victim as a condition of receiving custody of a child or as a
condition of visitation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (13)  If a court allows a family or household member to
supervise visitation, the court shall establish conditions to be followed
during visitation; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (14)  A supervised visitation center must provide:  a
secure setting and specialized procedures for supervised visitation and the
transfer of children for visitation and supervision by a person trained in
security and the avoidance of family violence. [L 1965, c 83, §1; Supp,

<p class=XNotes>  It is within family court's discretion to order custodial
parent to pay all or part of interstate transportation expenses incurred by
children when visiting noncustodial parent if order can be complied with
without decreasing funds reasonably necessary to support children and custodial
parent at relevant standard of living.  87 H. 369 (App.), 956 P.2d 1301.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In paragraph (7), the term &quot;shall&quot;, when used with
the phrase &quot;in the discretion of the court&quot;, signifies that
reasonable visitation rights are to be granted subject to the court's properly
exercised discretion.  88 H. 68 (App.), 961 P.2d 1162.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Paragraph (7) does not limit a family court's discretion to
deny rights of visitation only in the instance where a detriment to the best
interests of the child has been demonstrated.  88 H. 68 (App.), 961 P.2d 1162.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under paragraph (7), it is within family court's discretion
to evaluate the effect of awarding visitation rights to grandparents on the
visitation rights of a non-custodial parent.  88 H. 68 (App.), 961 P.2d 1162.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Paragraph (9) presumption that it would be detrimental to the
child and not in the best interest of the child to be placed in custody with
the perpetrator of family violence may be rebutted by the introduction of any
evidence which would support a finding of the presumption's nonexistence.  88
H. 200 (App.), 965 P.2d 133.  </p>

<p class=XNotes>  The term &quot;family violence&quot; in paragraph (9) (1993)
does not extend to the type of physical discipline of a child by his or her
parent that is expressly permitted in §703-309(1); the limits on the use of
physical force as a disciplinary measure in §703-309(1) adequately served to
guide the family court's application of paragraph (9) (1993) in determining the
best interests of the child when awarding custody or visitation.  88 H. 200
(App.), 965 P.2d 133.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In a proceeding brought by a parent to remove a non-parent as
a guardian of the parent's minor child, the family court must consider the
preference granted to parents in paragraph (1) in determining whether under
§560:5-212, it is in the best interest of the child to terminate the
guardianship.  93 H. 374 (App.), 4 P.3d 508.</p>
