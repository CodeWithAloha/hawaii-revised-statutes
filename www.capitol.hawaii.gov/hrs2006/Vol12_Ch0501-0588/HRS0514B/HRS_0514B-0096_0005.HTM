<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     [§514B-96.5]  Unit selection; requirements. 
</b>(a)  When the chronological system is used, the developer or the
developer's real estate broker, as the case may be, shall offer the residential
units that have been designated pursuant to section 514B&#8209;96 as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  For thirty days from the date of the first
published announcement or advertisement required under section 514B&#8209;95.5,
the developer or developer's real estate broker shall offer the residential
units that have been designated pursuant to section 514B&#8209;96 to
prospective purchasers chronologically in the order in which they submit to the
developer or the developer's real estate broker, a completed owner-occupant
affidavit, an executed sales contract or reservation, and an earnest money
deposit in a reasonable amount designated by the developer.  The developer or
the developer's real estate broker shall maintain at all times a sufficient
number of sales contracts and affidavits for prospective owner-occupants to
execute and shall make them first available to prospective owner-occupants on
the day immediately following the date of the first publication of the
announcement or advertisement for the duration of the time period as specified
in this paragraph.  Prospective purchasers who do not have the opportunity to
select a residential unit during the thirty-day period shall be placed on a
back-up reservation list in the order in which they submit a completed
owner-occupant affidavit and earnest money deposit in a reasonable amount
designated by the developer;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  If two or more prospective owner-occupants intend
to reside jointly in the same residential unit, only one residential unit
designated pursuant to section 514B&#8209;96 shall be offered to them, or only
one of them shall be placed on the backup reservation list;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  No developer, employee or agent of the developer,
or any real estate licensee, either directly or through any other person, shall
release any information or inform any prospective owner-occupant about the
publication announcement or advertisement referred to in section 514B&#8209;95.5,
including the date it is to appear and when the chronological system will be
initiated, until after the announcement or advertisement is published; <span
style='color:black'>provided that a developer, as part of any preregistration
solicitation permitted under section </span>514B<span style='color:black'>&#8209;85,
may disclose whether units will be offered to owner-occupants pursuant to this
subpart and whether a chronological or lottery system will be used; and</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span style='color:black'>     </span>(4)  The developer
shall compile and maintain a list of all prospective purchasers that submit a
completed owner-occupant affidavit, an executed sales contract or reservation,
and an earnest money deposit, and maintain a back-up reservation list, if any. 
Upon the request of the commission, the developer shall provide a copy of the
list of all prospective purchasers and the back-up reservation list.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  When the public lottery system is used,
the developer or the developer's broker, as the case may be, shall offer the
residential units that have been designated pursuant to section 514B&#8209;96
as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  From the date of the first published announcement
or advertisement required under section 514B&#8209;95.5 until five calendar
days after the last published announcement or advertisement, the developer or
developer's real estate broker shall compile and maintain a list of all
prospective owner-occupants who have submitted to the developer or the
developer's real estate broker a duly executed owner-occupant affidavit.  All
prospective owner-occupants on this list shall be included in the public
lottery described in paragraph (2).  The developer and the developer's real
estate broker shall maintain at all times sufficient copies of affidavits for
prospective owner-occupants to execute and shall make them first available to
prospective owner-occupants on the day immediately following the date of the
first publication of the announcement or advertisement for the duration of the
time period as specified in this subsection.  Upon the request of the
commission, the developer shall provide a copy of the lottery list of
prospective owner-occupants;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The developer or developer's real estate broker
shall conduct a public lottery on the date, time, and location as set forth in
the published announcement, or advertisement.  The lottery shall be held no
later than the thirtieth day following the date of the first published
announcement or advertisement.  Any person, including all prospective
owner-occupants eligible for the lottery, shall be allowed to attend the
lottery;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The public lottery shall be conducted so that no
prospective owner-occupant shall have an unfair advantage and, as to all
owner-occupants whose affidavits were submitted to the developer or the
developer's real estate broker within the time period specified in paragraph (1),
shall be conducted without regard to the order in which the affidavits were
submitted.  If two or more prospective owner-occupants intend to reside jointly
in the same residential unit, only one of them shall be entitled to enter the
public lottery; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  After the public lottery, each prospective
owner-occupant purchaser, in the order in which they are selected in the
lottery, shall be given the opportunity to select one of the residential units
that have been designated pursuant to section 514B&#8209;96, execute a sales
contract, and submit an earnest money deposit in a reasonable amount designated
by the developer.  The developer shall maintain a list, in the order of
selection, of all prospective purchasers selected in the lottery, and maintain
a list of all prospective purchasers who selected one of the residential units
designated pursuant to section 514B&#8209;96.  Prospective purchasers selected
in the lottery who did not have the opportunity to select one of the
residential units designated pursuant to section 514B&#8209;96, but who
submitted an earnest money deposit in a reasonable amount designated by the
developer, shall be placed on a back-up reservation list in the order in which
they were selected in the public lottery.  Upon request of the commission, copies
of the lists shall be submitted. [L 2005, c 93, pt of §4]</p>
