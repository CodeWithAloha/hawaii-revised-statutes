<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§523A-25  Claim of another state to recover
property; procedure.</b>  (a)  At any time after property has been paid or
delivered to the director under this part another state may recover the
property if:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The property was subject to custody by this State
because the records of the holder did not reflect the last known address of the
apparent owner when the property was presumed abandoned under this part, and
the other state establishes that the last known address of the apparent owner
or other person entitled to the property was in that state and under the laws
of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of
abandonment by that state;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The last known address of the apparent owner or
other person entitled to the property, as reflected by the records of the
holder, is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property has
escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The records of the holder were erroneous in that
they did not accurately reflect the actual owner of the property and the last
known address of the actual owner is in the other state and under the laws of
that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment
by that state;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The property was subjected to custody by this
State under section 523A-3(6) and under the laws of the state of domicile of
the holder the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of
abandonment by that state; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The property is the sum payable on a travelers
check, money order, or other similar instrument that was subjected to custody
by this State under section 523A-4, and the instrument was purchased in the
other state, and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or
became subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The claim of another state to recover
escheated or abandoned property shall be presented in a form prescribed by the
director, who shall decide the claim within one hundred twenty days after it is
presented.  The director shall allow the claim if the director determines that
the other state is entitled to the abandoned property under subsection (a).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The director shall require a state, before
recovering property under this section, to agree to indemnify this State and
its officers and employees against any liability on a claim for the property.
