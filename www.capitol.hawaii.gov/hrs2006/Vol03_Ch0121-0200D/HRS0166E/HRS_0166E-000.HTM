<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     [§166E-1]  Legislative findings.</b>  The
legislature finds that article XI, section 10, of the State Constitution
establishes that &quot;the public lands shall be used for the development of
farm and homeownership on as widespread a basis as possible, in accordance with
procedures and limitations prescribed by law.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Therefore, the legislature finds that certain
public lands classified for agricultural use by the department of land and
natural resources should be transferred to the department of agriculture, with
the approval of the board of land and natural resources and the board of
agriculture, for purposes and in a manner consistent with article XI, section
10, of the State Constitution.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The purpose of this chapter is to ensure the
long-term productive use of public lands leased or available to be leased by
the department of land and natural resources for agricultural purposes by
allowing these lands to be transferred to and managed by the department of
agriculture. [L 2003, c 90, pt of §1]</p>

impair any contract existing as of the effective date of this Act [May 28,
2003] in a manner violative of either the Constitution of the State of Hawaii
or Article I, Section 10, of the United States Constitution.&quot;</p>

to manage the transferred non-agricultural park lands under rules adopted by
the board pursuant to chapter 91.  The program and its rules shall be separate
and distinct from the agricultural park program and its rules. 
Non-agricultural park lands are not the same as, and shall not be selected or
managed as are lands under agricultural park leases.  Notwithstanding any other
law to the contrary, the program shall include the following conditions
pertaining to encumbered non-agricultural park lands:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The lessee or permittee shall perform in full
compliance with the existing lease or permit;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>The transfer of non-agricultural park lands shall be
done in a manner to be determined by the board of agriculture [and] may include
more than one parcel; provided that these parcels are geographically adjacent
to one another.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  For any encumbered or unencumbered
non-agricultural park lands transferred to the department that are not being
utilized or required for the public purpose stated, the order setting aside the
lands shall be withdrawn and the lands shall be returned to the department of
land and natural resources. [L 2003, c 90, pt of §1]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§166E-4]  Conversion of qualified and
encumbered other agricultural lands.</b>  The department shall establish
