<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Instream use&quot; means beneficial uses
of stream water for significant purposes which are located in the stream and
which are achieved by leaving the water in the stream.  Instream uses include,
but are not limited to:</p>

slough, or natural watercourse in which water usually flows in a defined bed or
channel.  It is not essential that the flowing be uniform or uninterrupted.

does not prevent the watercourse from being a stream.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Stream channel&quot; means a natural or
artificial watercourse with a definite bed and banks which periodically or
continuously contains flowing water.  The channel referred to is that which

surface water--that is, water upon the surface of the earth in bounds created
naturally or artificially including, but not limited to, streams, other
watercourses, lakes, reservoirs, and coastal waters subject to state
jurisdiction--and diffused surface water--that is, water occurring upon the
surface of the ground other than in contained water bodies.  Water from natural
springs is surface water when it exits from the spring onto the earth's
surface.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Sustainable yield&quot; means the maximum
rate at which water may be withdrawn from a water source without impairing the
utility or quality of the water source as determined by the commission.</p>

means, in view of the nature, manner, and purposes of a reasonable and
beneficial use of water, the most accurate method of describing the time when
the water is withdrawn or diverted, including description in terms of hours, days,
weeks, months, or physical, operational, or other conditions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Water&quot; or &quot;waters of the
State&quot; means any and all water on or beneath the surface of the ground,
including natural or artificial watercourses, lakes, ponds, or diffused surface
water and water percolating, standing, or flowing beneath the surface of the
ground.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Watercourse&quot; means a stream and any
canal, ditch, or other artificial watercourse in which water usually flows in a
defined bed or channel.  It is not essential that the flowing be uniform or
uninterrupted.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Water management area&quot; means a
geographic area which has been designated pursuant to section 174C-41 as
requiring management of the ground or surface water resource, or both.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Water source&quot; means a place within
or from which water is or may be developed, including but not limited to:  (1)
generally, an area such as a watershed defined by topographic boundaries, or a
definitive ground water body; and (2) specifically, a particular stream, other
surface water body, spring, tunnel, or well or related combination thereof.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Well&quot; means an artificial excavation
or opening into the ground, or an artificial enlargement of a natural opening
by which ground water is drawn or is or may be used or can be made to be usable
to supply reasonable and beneficial uses within the State. [L 1987, c 45, pt of
§2; am L 1998, c 101, §2]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Commission did not err in excluding golf course irrigation
from the category of &quot;agricultural use&quot;.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The &quot;reasonable-beneficial use&quot; standard and the
related criterion of &quot;consistent with the public interest&quot; demand
examination of the proposed use not only standing alone, but also in relation
to other public and private uses and the particular water source in question;
thus, permit applicants requesting water diverted from streams must duly take
into account the public interest in instream flows.   94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>
