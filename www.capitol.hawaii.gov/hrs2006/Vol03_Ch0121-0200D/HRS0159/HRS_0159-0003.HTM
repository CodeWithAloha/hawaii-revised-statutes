for which a standard of fill of container has been prescribed by the board
under this chapter, and it falls below the standard of fill of container
applicable thereto, unless its label bears, in the manner and form as the board
prescribes, a statement that it falls below the standard.</p>

special dietary uses, unless its label bears the information concerning its
vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties as the board, after consultation
