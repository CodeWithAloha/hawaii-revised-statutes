containing a business plan, which is consistent with the business and
agricultural development plan, including a description of the enterprise and

corporation by the enterprise for adequate reporting of financial data to the
corporation, which shall include a requirement for an annual or other periodic
audit of the books of the enterprise, and for control by the corporation that
it considers prudent over the management of the enterprise, in order to protect
the investment of the corporation, including membership on the board of
directors of the enterprise, ownership of voting stock, input in management

securities of any one enterprise, except that more than a total of $500,000 may
