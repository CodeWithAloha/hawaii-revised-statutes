notwithstanding, to regulate or prohibit, by means of licensing, rationing, or

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Furtherance of federal programs.  To further and

by transferring to the federal government at its request the state employment
service with its personnel, records, facilities, equipment, and supplies, and
making similar requested transfers of other services when the governor finds
