<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§161-22]  Post-mortem inspection;
reinspection.</b>  A post-mortem examination and inspection of the carcasses
and parts thereof of all poultry capable of use as human food, to be processed
at any slaughtering, poultry-canning, packing, or similar establishment in this
State in which such poultry or poultry products are prepared solely for
intrastate commerce; and the carcasses and parts thereof of all such poultry or
poultry products found to be not adulterated shall be marked, stamped, tagged,
or labeled, as &quot;Hawaii Inspected and Passed&quot;; and said inspectors
shall label, mark, stamp, or tag as &quot;Hawaii Inspected and Condemned&quot;,
all carcasses and parts thereof of poultry or poultry products found to be
adulterated; and all carcasses and parts thereof thus inspected and condemned
shall be destroyed for food purposes by the establishment in the presence of an
inspector, and the board may remove inspectors from any such establishment
which fails to so destroy any condemned carcass or part thereof, and the inspectors,
after the first inspection shall, when they deem it necessary, reinspect the
carcasses or parts thereof to determine whether since the first inspection the
same have become adulterated and if any carcass or any part thereof shall, upon
examination and inspection subsequent to the first examination and inspection,
be found to be adulterated, it shall be destroyed for food purposes by the
establishment in the presence of an inspector, and the board may withdraw
inspection from any establishment which fails to so destroy any condemned
carcass or part thereof.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The foregoing provisions, including those in
section 161-21, shall apply to all poultry and carcasses or parts of carcasses
of poultry or poultry products thereof, capable of use as human food, which may
be brought into any poultry slaughtering, poultry-canning, packing, or similar
establishment, where inspection under this part is maintained, and such
examination and inspection shall be made before the carcasses or parts thereof
shall be allowed to enter into any establishment wherein the same are to be
treated and prepared for poultry products; and the foregoing provisions shall
also apply to all such products which, after having been issued from any
poultry slaughtering, poultry-canning, packing, or similar establishment, shall
be returned to the same or to any similar establishment where such inspection
is maintained.  The board may limit the entry of poultry or poultry products,
and other materials into any establishment at which inspection under this part
is maintained, under such conditions it may prescribe to assure that allowing
the entry of such poultry or poultry products into such inspected
establishments will be consistent with the purpose of this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The board shall cause to be made by
veterinarians and poultry inspectors appointed for that purpose an examination
and inspection of all poultry or poultry products processed in any poultry
slaughtering, poultry-canning, packing, or similar establishment, where such
poultry or poultry products are prepared solely for intrastate commerce and for
the purposes of any examination and inspection the inspectors shall have access
at all times, by day or night, whether the establishment is operating or not,
to every part of said establishment; and the inspectors shall mark, stamp, tag
or label as &quot;Hawaii Inspected and Passed&quot; all such poultry or poultry
products found to be not adulterated; and said inspectors shall label, mark,
stamp, or tag as &quot;Hawaii Inspected and Condemned&quot; all such poultry or
poultry products found adulterated, and all condemned poultry or poultry
products shall be destroyed for food purposes and the board may withdraw
inspection from any establishment which fails to so destroy such condemned
poultry or poultry products. [L 1969, c 212, §14]</p>
