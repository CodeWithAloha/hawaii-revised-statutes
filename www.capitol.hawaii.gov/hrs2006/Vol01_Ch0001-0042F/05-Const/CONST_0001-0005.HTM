<p class=XNotes><b>Civil rights.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Employer's policy of denying any extended leave during
employee's first year of employment violated Hawaii administrative rule §12&#8209;46&#8209;108,
which was adopted to enforce the legislative mandate of §378&#8209;2(1)(A) and
Hawaii's constitutional prohibition against sex discrimination in the exercise
of a person's civil rights in employment.  89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104.</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Due process.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where landowners argued that ordinance creating mechanism
through which condominium owners could convert their leasehold interests into
fee simple interests was arbitrary and irrational, landowners could not meet

<p class=XNotes>  Applicable only to state action not private action.  698 F.
Supp. 1496.</p>

rational exercise of legislative power.  832 F. Supp. 1404.</p>

too vague to satisfy requirement of due process.  50 H. 384, 441 P.2d 333.</p>

480 P.2d 148.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  HRS §709&#8209;33, together with other sections of Part II,

reasonable doubt.  53 H. 40, 487 P.2d 283.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  HRS §621&#8209;22, allowing introduction of prior convictions
to impeach credibility of defendant in criminal case was unconstitutional.  53
H. 254, 492 P.2d 657.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  HRS §712&#8209;1214(1)(a), with definitions in §712&#8209;1210(5),

right not to be tried while incompetent.  60 H. 17, 586 P.2d 1028.</p>

63 H. 430, 629 P.2d 1116.</p>

to examine witnesses where claim was impermissibly suggestive identification.

<p class=XNotes>  Right to fair trial denied where sum of prosecutor's conduct
was prejudicial.  72 H. 278, 815 P.2d 428.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Police tactics designed to detect drug-related offenses, including
officer posing as drug dealer and supplying and selling drugs in &quot;reverse
buy&quot; operation, were not so outrageous as to deprive defendant of right to
due process.  73 H. 179, 830 P.2d 492.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Claim for relief against state officials based on alleged illegality
of exchange of ceded lands was barred by State's sovereign immunity.  73 H.
578, 837 P.2d 1247.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not violated by defendant's absence from conference
settling jury instructions as conference does not involve jury's presence or
witness testimony.  74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Requires unbiased administrative adjudicators; no violation
where §88&#8209;77 trustees not shown to have pecuniary or institutional
disqualifying interest in adjudication.  74 H. 181, 840 P.2d 367.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Written notice of specific charges not required for §710&#8209;1077(1)(a)
direct summary criminal contempt case; contemnor's misconduct and judge's
response did not require contempt trial before different judge.  74 H. 267, 842
P.2d 255.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Use at sentencing of statements previously obtained in
violation of a defendant's privilege against self-incrimination violates that
defendant's privilege against self-incrimination and right to due process.  74
H. 424, 848 P.2d 376.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Third-party agreements homestead lessees entered into with
third party non-Hawaiian farmers could not be considered property interests. 
76 H. 128, 870 P.2d 1272.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellant had a right under the due process clause, to be
given reasonable notice of the circuit court's intention to apply §706&#8209;660.1(a)
(1985) in sentencing appellant in connection with kidnapping conviction and to
be afforded the opportunity to be heard with respect thereto.  76 H. 517, 880
P.2d  192.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Coercive conduct of a private person may be sufficient to
render a confession inadmissible based on this section and article I, §10 of
Hawai'i constitution.  77 H. 51, 881 P.2d 538.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because appellants had been afforded an adequate opportunity
to challenge the fine assessed by department of land utilization on appeal--at
both administrative and judicial levels--before they incurred any obligation to
pay it, the application of the procedural mechanism set forth in section of
land use ordinance had not violated their right to due process of law.  77 H.
168, 883 P.2d 629.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Supreme court declined to hold that State must tape record a
custodial interrogation in order to establish a valid waiver of a criminal
defendant's constitutional rights.  77 H. 403, 886 P.2d 740.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Presumption of nonconsent imposed on appellant a burden of
persuasion of the nonexistence of an essential element of the crime with which
appellant was charged; so construed, the presumption would violate due process
clauses of Fourteenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution and this section by virtue
of improperly shifting burden of proof to appellant.  78 H. 262, 892 P.2d 455.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  To protect the right to testify under Hawai'i constitution,
trial courts must advise criminal defendants of their right to testify and must
obtain on-the-record waiver of that right in every case in which the defendant
does not testify.  79 H. 226, 900 P.2d 1293. </p>

<p class=XNotes>  Reversible error where jury may have reached verdict by
improperly shifting burden of proof from prosecution to defense by concluding
that defendant had not established defendant's claim of extreme mental or
emotional distress before considering whether prosecution had disproved that
defense beyond a reasonable doubt. 80 H. 172, 907 P.2d 758.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant received adequate notice that consecutive sentences
may be imposed by sentencing court where court had that discretion by statute,
and plain language of §706&#8209;668.5 informed defendant that defendant may be
sentenced to consecutive sentences.  81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The right of an accused to a unanimous verdict in a criminal
prosecution, tried before a jury in a court of this State, is guaranteed by
this section and §14 of this article of the Hawaii constitution.  84 H. 1, 928
P.2d 843.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When separate and distinct culpable acts are subsumed within
a single count charging a sexual assault, the trial court must either (1)
require the prosecution to elect the specific act upon which the prosecution is
relying to establish the &quot;conduct&quot; element of the charged offense, or
(2) give the jury a specific unanimity instruction.  84 H. 1, 928 P.2d 843.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 704&#8209;415 does not violate due process
principles; at release hearing, insanity acquittee bears burden of proving by
preponderance of evidence freedom from mental illness and dangerous
propensities.  84 H. 269, 933 P.2d 606.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where violation of misdemeanor offense under §712&#8209;1248(1)(d)
also constituted violation of felony offense under §712&#8209;1247(1)(h),
conviction of felony offense would have constituted violation of defendant's
due process and equal protection rights.  86 H. 48, 947 P.2d 360.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In products liability action, cumulative effect of three
alleged errors by trial court did not deny defendants right to fair trial where
overwhelming and substantial evidence supported jury's verdict.  86 H. 214, 948
P.2d 1055.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although appellant was not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine
witnesses who had testified at a public hearing but not before the zoning board
of appeals, error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  87 H. 217, 953 P.2d
1315.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Director's exposure to materials outside the record
constitutionally harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as director expressly
declined to consider material in rendering decision.  87 H. 217, 953 P.2d 1315.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A trial court must pass on a defendant's attempted withdrawal
of the prior waiver of his or her right to testify, tendered before the
commencement of closing arguments, pursuant to the &quot;liberal
approach&quot;, whereas such an attempted withdrawal tendered thereafter is
subject to the &quot;manifest injustice&quot; standard.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d
239.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant did not meet burden of establishing plausible
and legitimate reasons for withdrawal of defendant's prior waiver of
defendant's right to testify, defendant failed to present &quot;fair and just
reasons&quot; for defendant's request to exercise defendant's right to testify
in defendant's own behalf; thus trial court did not abuse discretion by ruling
that it would not reopen case.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court's denial of defendant's post-verdict motion
for a new trial--based on defendant's claim that defendant's attempt to withdraw
defendant's waiver of right to testify in defendant's own behalf should have
been allowed--was not &quot;manifestly unjust&quot;, no abuse of discretion. 
88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court failed to correct prosecution's erroneous
interpretation of &quot;remains unlawfully&quot; under §708&#8209;810,
defendant's constitutional rights to due process and a unanimous jury verdict
violated.  89 H. 284, 972 P.2d 287.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A vessel and its accompanying mooring and live-aboard permits
are constitutionally protected &quot;property&quot;, of which an individual may
not be deprived without notice and an opportunity to be heard.  91 H. 1, 979
P.2d 586.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Procedural due process violated where State informed boat
owner by letter of impoundment and possible disposal of vessel, but made no
mention of any procedures available for challenging that action, administrative
or otherwise, and boat owner was never provided with an opportunity to be heard
on matter of vessel's impoundment.  91 H. 1, 979 P.2d 586.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Findings under §706&#8209;662(5) regarding (a) the age or
handicapped status of the victim and (b) whether &quot;such disability is known
or reasonably should be known to the defendant&quot; entail
&quot;intrinsic&quot; facts; Hawaii constitution requires these findings to be
made by the trier of fact, not the sentencing court.  91 H. 261, 982 P.2d 890.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  For purposes of this section, due process requires that an
order for the nonemergency involuntary administration of antipsychotic
medications to a criminal defendant must be based upon facts found by clear and
convincing evidence.  91 H. 319, 984 P.2d 78.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Three separate findings required by trial court before 
criminal defendant may constitutionally be involuntarily medicated with
antipsychotic drugs, where it is alleged that the medication is necessary
because the defendant poses a danger to himself or herself or others.  91 H.
319, 984 P.2d 78.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Out-of-state attorneys, who were granted pro hac vice status,
not denied procedural due process prior to revocation of status and imposition
of sanctions where three separate oral notices were given to one attorney and
to local counsel.  91 H. 372, 984 P.2d 1198.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's constitutional right to unanimous verdict not
violated as §707&#8209;715 defines a single criminal offense; subsections (1)
and (2) constitute alternative means of establishing the mens rea of the
offense of terroristic threatening--either one giving rise to the same criminal
culpability.  92 H. 577, 994 P.2d 509.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where evidence concerned only a single incident of culpable
conduct, trial court was not required to read the jury a specific unanimity
instruction; right to unanimous verdict thus not violated.  93 H. 199, 998 P.2d
479.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In sex assault case, jury instruction as to ineffective
consent prejudicially affected defendant's rights because (1) the jury was
instructed that it could convict defendant based on the absence of consent
under §702&#8209;233 or any of the four grounds of ineffective consent under
§702&#8209;235, (2) there was a reasonable possibility that the verdict was
based upon at least one of the four grounds of ineffective consent, and (3)
there was legally insufficient evidence to support any of the four grounds of
ineffective consent.  96 H. 161, 29 P.3d 351.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Unanimity is not required where alternative means of
establishing an element of an offense are submitted to the jury, provided that
there is no reasonable possibility that the jury's verdict was based on an
alternative unsupported by sufficient evidence.  96 H. 161, 29 P.3d 351.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Juror questioning of witnesses did not deprive defendant of
fair and impartial trial where questions posed by jurors were carefully
reviewed by the trial court and questions tending to elicit improper or
inadmissible evidence were excluded.  97 H. 206, 35 P.3d 233.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As §846E&#8209;3 operated to deprive defendant of a protected
liberty interest and provided defendant with neither notice nor an opportunity
to be heard prior to notifying the public of defendant's status as a convicted
sex offender, §846E&#8209;3 denied defendant due process under this section;
§846E&#8209;3 thus void and unenforceable.  97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not
interfere with any of a sex offender's protected liberty interests, the
protections of procedural due process are not triggered.  97 H. 285, 36 P.3d
1255.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict not violated by
trial court's refusal to give a specific unanimity instruction as defendant's
actual and constructive possession of the methamphetamine comprised a
continuing course of conduct.  99 H. 198, 53 P.3d 806.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As an aspect of procedural due process, individuals must, as
needed, be provided an interpreter at family court proceedings where their
parental rights are substantially affected.  99 H. 522, 57 P.3d 447.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Parents have a substantive liberty interest in the care,
custody, and control of their children protected by the due process clause of
this section.  99 H. 522, 57 P.3d 447.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where negativing of defendant's mitigating extreme mental or
emotional distress defense by prosecution was a material element of the offense
of first degree murder such that jury unanimity was a prerequisite to returning
any verdict, and trial court's special instruction expressly directed the jury
to convict defendant of manslaughter if a single juror believed that the prosecution
had failed to negative the mitigating defense, right to unanimous jury verdict
violated.  99 H. 542, 57 P.3d 467.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where family court conducted an in camera review of the
complainant's child protection services records and produced the relevant portions
to defense counsel, defendant's due process rights not violated; and family
court's order to seal the remaining portions of the child protection services
file for appellate review did not constitute an abuse of discretion.  101 H.
172, 65 P.3d 119.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The alternative states of mind potentially requisite to the
charged offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, as prescribed by the
definition of &quot;intent to defraud&quot; set forth in §708-800, does not
implicate a defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, as
guaranteed by article I, §14 and this section of the Hawaii constitution; a
proper elements instruction, which sets forth the alternative states of mind
prescribed by the &quot;intent to defraud&quot; component of second degree theft
by shoplifting, does not violate defendant's constitutional right.  101 H. 389,
69 P.3d 517.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Lost opportunities for concurrent sentencing, parole, and
loss of parental rights do not affect a defendant's ability to present an
effective defense, and thus do not constitute actual substantial prejudice to a
defendant's due process right to a fair trial.  102 H. 183, 74 P.3d 6.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was no evidence that the trial court either
reviewed the reasons for the preindictment delay prior to requiring a showing
of actual substantial prejudice to the defendant or required a showing of
something less than actual substantial prejudice, the trial court did not
misapply the correct standard to be used to determine whether charges should be
dismissed for preindictment delay.  102 H. 183, 74 P.3d 6.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Vexatious litigant's due process right not impacted in
present or future cases where litigant was only restrained from bringing
unmeritorious litigation, which could be restricted in any event; as trial
court held a hearing to review litigant's objections to prefiling order, order
imposed on litigant under §634J-7 satisfied procedural due process because it
afforded litigant notice and an opportunity to be heard.  102 H. 289, 75 P.3d
1180.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 663-15.5 adequately protects a non-settling joint
tortfeasor's right to procedural due process; subsections (b) and (c) afford a
non-settling joint tortfeasor notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding
the determination whether a settlement has been given in good faith and, consequently,
bars cross-claims for contribution against the settling joint tortfeasor.  102
H. 399, 77 P.3d 83.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No prosecutorial misconduct by prosecutor's questions and
remarks regarding defendant's failure to &quot;explain away&quot; the DNA
evidence as questions and remarks were more analogous to legitimate
prosecutorial comment on the state of the evidence and not the improper
shifting of the burden of proof onto the defendant.  103 H. 38, 79 P.3d 131.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant's statements were not the product of
&quot;interrogation&quot;, but, rather, were &quot;volunteered confessions or
admissions, obtained independent of express police questioning or its
functional equivalent&quot;, defendant's constitutional rights against
self-incrimination and due process of law not violated.  104 H. 224, 87 P.3d
893.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The lifetime registration component of the Hawaii sex
offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under
this section and requires that minimum requirements of due process--notice and
opportunity to be heard--be afforded to convicted sex offenders; such a
proceeding may be instituted by a sex offender in a special proceeding.  105 H.
222, 96 P.3d 242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>   Under this section, due process requires that a convicted
sex offender under §846E-1 be afforded the right to a judicial hearing at which
evidence may be offered to demonstrate that continuance of all or part of the
lifetime registration requirements are not necessary in a particular case to
fulfill the public need to which the sex offender act responded.  105 H. 222,
96 P.3d 242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Applying the covered loss deductible under §431:10C-301.5 to
plaintiff's recovery of underinsured motorist benefits did not violate
plaintiff's right to substantive due process as the legislature's policy
determination to enact this section to reduce one of the costs of the motor
vehicle insurance system was expressly within the constitutional purview of the
legislature.  106 H. 511, 107 P.3d 440.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Assuming that possession of leased premises and rent to be
paid into the trust fund are property interests protected under the due process
clause, §666-21 does not offend due process as tenants are afforded an
opportunity to challenge summary possession and motions for the establishment
of a rent trust fund.  107 H. 73, 110 P.3d 397.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right not violated by administrative driver's license
revocation hearing procedure where defendant was afforded a hearing where
witnesses were called and defendant was represented by counsel, and hearing
office advised counsel of the procedure that hearing officer was going to
follow.  108 H. 31, 116 P.3d 673.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where mother was denied an opportunity to be heard at a
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner as to the termination of her
parental rights--that is, without a trial concerning her substantive liberty
interests in the care, custody, and control of her children--mother was
deprived of the custody of her children without a fair hearing.  108 H. 144,
118 P.3d 54.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Deprivation of property solely on basis of substituted
service in adverse possession action violates due process, where, with due
diligence, actual notice possible.  6 H. App. 241, 718 P.2d 1109.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Does not require agency hearing before tax director issues
notices of tax assessment.  6 H. App. 260, 718 P.2d 1122.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In paternity action, due process not violated by exclusion of
sexual access information and preclusion of cross-examination of mother
regarding her earlier pregnancy.  6 H. App. 629, 736 P.2d 448.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act of state witness leaving witness stand in presence of
security personnel was not so prejudicial as to deny defendant's right to fair
trial; jury is presumed to adhere to court's cautionary instruction to draw no
inference from event.  8 H. App. 624, 817 P.2d 130.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated where court imposed attorney sanctions pursuant to
its powers under §603&#8209;21.9 without adequate prior notice and reasonable
opportunity to be heard.  9 H. App. 249, 833 P.2d 85.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because the constitutional right of allocution is one
afforded &quot;pre-sentence&quot;, manifestly, the defendant must be given the
opportunity to be heard before the court imposes sentence; defendant had right
of allocution before being sentenced for misdemeanor offense of driving with
revoked license and for violation charge of illegal turn.  77 H. 241 (App.),
883 P.2d 663.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's constitutional and statutory right to testify in
defendant's own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow
defendant's attorney's advice and thus refrain from testifying, and the
violation was plain error; denial of the right to testify was prejudicial and
not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right to an impartial judge was violated where
nature and extent of the court's questioning of one of the complainants
demonstrated that the court assumed the role of a prosecutor, thus failing to
act impartially.  When the court assumes the role of a prosecutor, it violates
the fundamental due process requirement that the tribunal be impartial, and
such an error, by definition, is inherently prejudicial and not harmless.  78
H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Motions court's order denying defendant's pre-trial motion to
dismiss for pre-indictment delay affirmed, where, inter alia, motions court was
correct in concluding that defendant failed to establish that defendant's
claimed inability to recollect events prior to defendant's indictment, even
with the aid of others, amounted to substantial prejudice to defendant's right
to a fair trial.  79 H. 165 (App.), 880 P.2d 217.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated where trial court's exclusion of gun-like cigarette
lighter prejudiced defendant by precluding jury from properly evaluating
essential defense evidence.  79 H. 385 (App.), 903 P.2d 690.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated where petitioner whose driver's license was
administratively revoked denied right to cross-examine director's
representative regarding basis for continuance of administrative hearing.  80
H. 358 (App.), 910 P.2d 129.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant entitled to elicit evidence of complainant's past
sexual behavior, not to attack complainant's character, but to determine whether
complainant was mentally defective and whether defendant knew that complainant
was mentally defective.  81 H. 447 (App.), 918 P.2d 254.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where discussion that defendant was subject to mandatory
minimum terms of imprisonment pursuant to §706&#8209;660.1 was conducted at
bench outside of defendant's hearing, defendant was not given reasonable notice
of intended application of mandatory minimum term statute.  82 H. 158 (App.),
920 P.2d 372.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 291C&#8209;112, which prohibits the use of a vehicle
&quot;for purposes of human habitation&quot;, not unconstitutionally vague.  82
H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Reasonable grounds&quot; standard of §709&#8209;906(4)
not unconstitutionally vague where standard is an objective standard requiring
a trial court to independently assess facts and circumstances which responding
officers had before them in determining to issue warning citations.  82 H. 381
(App.), 922 P.2d 994.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 709&#8209;906(4) not overbroad as issuance of warning
citation must be based on objective facts and circumstances, other than merely
a complainant's claim, which would lead a reasonable police officer to believe
recent physical abuse was inflicted on family or household member.  82 H. 381
(App.), 922 P.2d 994.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated where claimant failed to serve employer and insurer
with motion and summons; circuit court thus did not acquire personal
jurisdiction over employer and insurer and judgment and garnishee summons
issued pursuant to §386&#8209;91 in absence of personal jurisdiction void.  82
H. 405 (App.), 922 P.2d 1018.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Procedural due process right not denied when guardian ad
litem not appointed for mother where mother was provided with court-appointed
attorney and, pursuant to §587&#8209;34(d), court determined mother was capable
of comprehending legal significance of issues.  85 H. 119 (App.), 938 P.2d 178.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Application of preponderance of the evidence standard as
appropriate judicial basis for issuance of protective order under §586&#8209;5.5
does not violate right.  85 H. 197 (App.), 940 P.2d 404.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where building addition was permitted structure under zoning
ordinance in existence at time subsequent land use ordinance was adopted,
requiring landowner to remove addition and pay daily fines until addition was
removed constituted interference with landowner's vested property rights under
this clause.  86 H. 343 (App.), 949 P.2d 183.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right violated where circuit court's instruction to jury
regarding the statutory presumption created by §708&#8209;801(4) failed to
further instruct jury pursuant to HRE rule 306(a) that the presumption is merely
a permissible inference of fact and that in order to apply the presumption, the
jury must find that the presumed fact exists beyond a reasonable doubt.  88 H.
216 (App.), 965 P.2d 149.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As no Hawaii statute governing parole requires a parolee's
parole to be automatically revoked upon the parolee's conviction and sentence
to imprisonment for a crime committed while on parole, and §353&#8209;62
appears to vest Hawaii paroling authority with discretion to revoke parole,
parolee's right violated when authority summarily revoked parole without giving
parolee a final revocation hearing.  88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 852&#8209;1 not void for vagueness as:  (1) a person
of ordinary intelligence would have a reasonable opportunity to know that it is
unlawful to refuse or wilfully fail to move as directed by an officer; (2)
person may then choose between the lawful and unlawful conduct; and (3) the
statute provides sufficiently explicit standards for those who apply it.  89 H.
27 (App.), 968 P.2d 194.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the due process clause of the Hawaii constitution,
entrapment by estoppel defense may be raised against the State in criminal
cases and clause would be violated if the facts established the defense.  89 H.
27 (App.), 968 P.2d 194.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 52D&#8209;8 provides officers with a constitutionally
protected property interest--the right to legal representation for acting
within the scope of their duty; due process thus entitles an officer to a
contested case hearing under chapter 91 before the officer can be deprived of this
interest.  89 H. 221 (App.), 971 P.2d 310.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right violated where jury instruction failed to correctly 
convey proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard to jury; instruction that jury
must be &quot;firmly convinced&quot; of defendant's guilt diminished this very high
standard by which jury must abide in order to convict.  90 H. 113 (App.), 976
P.2d 427.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right violated by trial court entering free-standing
restitution order where no notice was provided to defendant that defendant's
original sentence might be modified at the hearing on the probation officer's
motion to revoke restitution.  92 H. 36 (App.), 986 P.2d 987.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court did not apply clear and convincing standard
of proof on complainant as required by §604&#8209;10.5, applied a subjective
rather than objective reasonable person standard in evaluating whether
defendant's conduct caused complainant emotional distress, and violated
defendant's due process rights, court erred by denying defendant's motion for
reconsideration of injunction order.  92 H. 330 (App.), 991 P.2d 840.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was a distinct and reasonable possibility that
trial court's error in commenting upon the location of the incriminating items
contributed to the conviction of the defendants, error materially impinged upon
defendants' right to trial by jury, and error was not harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt.  92 H. 675 (App.), 994 P.2d 607.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The conditions for eligibility for parole under the Hawaii
sex offender treatment program, which includes admitting to committing a sexual
offense, implicate a protected liberty interest under this section; this
section of the Hawaii constitution provides an independent basis for the due
process right to a sex offender classification hearing before such requirements
may be imposed.  93 H. 298 (App.), 1 P.3d 768.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was no genuine possibility that the jurors were
not unanimous as to the conduct for which defendant was found culpable, trial
court's failure to give specific unanimity instruction as to the
methamphetamine manufacturing offense did not violate defendant's substantial
due process right to a unanimous jury verdict.  95 H. 365 (App.), 22 P.3d 1012.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 711&#8209;1102 not unconstitutionally vague under
this section as its language is specific and clear, it is narrowly tailored to a
person's failure to disperse pursuant to a law enforcement order to leave the
immediate vicinity of disorderly conduct, and citizens of this State should
thus have no difficulty in understanding §711&#8209;1102.  101 H. 153 (App.),
64 P.3d 282.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right violated where, based on the specific facts
of the case, trial court abused its discretion in directing, over defendant's
objection, that defendant testify before defendant's other defense witness;
error not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as there was a reasonable
possibility that trial court's error contributed to defendant's conviction. 
102 H. 369 (App.), 76 P.3d 612.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Having been previously convicted of driving without motor
vehicle insurance, driver was clearly on notice that driving without motor
vehicle insurance was a criminal offense; thus, revocation of driver's
suspended sentence for commission of the same offense during the period of
suspension did not implicate driver's due process rights.  106 H. 391 (App.),
105 P.3d 1197.</p>

intentionally discriminate against Native Hawaiians.  802 F. Supp. 326.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Condominium lease-to-fee ordinance did not violate
plaintiff's equal protection rights.  832 F. Supp. 1404.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation, where plaintiff argued that §490:2&#8209;725
discriminated among two classes of warranty claimants, and appeared to argue
that UCC arbitrarily discriminated among differing classes of defendants,
insofar as it granted partial immunity to those in commercial sales without
similarly limiting the liability of others potentially liable for industrial

<p class=XNotes>  In view of underlying differences between cars and

analysis under this section; §572&#8209;1 is presumed to be unconstitutional
unless defendant, as agent of State, can show that statute's sex-based
classification is justified by compelling state interests, and statute is
narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of applicant couples'
constitutional rights.  74 H. 530, 852 P.2d 44.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by trial court's redaction of home street

where redaction procedure was not administered differently against other
similarly situated criminal defendants having jury trials in the first
circuit.  85 H. 258, 942 P.2d 522.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where violation of misdemeanor offense under §712&#8209;1248(1)(d)
also constituted violation of felony offense under §712&#8209;1247(1)(h), conviction

burdens within that category and classification applied to properties whose
actual use was transient or short-term, regardless of whether the units were
used personally. 90 H. 334, 978 P.2d 772.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Clause not violated by §709&#8209;906 as State has a
legitimate interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its
citizens, enactment of §709&#8209;906 to address family violence within the
community is &quot;legitimate&quot; in protecting Hawaii's citizens, and as
including family and household members within scope of §709&#8209;906 may
reduce or deter family violence by imposing upon violators greater criminal
punishment than criminal assault, it is rationally related to the State's
interest in preventing incidents of family violence.  93 H. 63, 996 P.2d 268.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Search warrant did not violate appellant's rights under the
U.S. and Hawaii Constitutions although it was not issued against any other
bettors; to raise the selective prosecution defense, appellant needed to
present sufficient evidence as to why appellant was prosecuted while the other
seven bettors were not; reason provided by appellant that detective arbitrarily
&quot;classified&quot; appellant as part of a conspiracy did not explain why
only appellant was subject to the search warrant nor did it distinguish
appellant from other bettors.  104 H. 323, 89 P.3d 823.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the imposition of a rent trust fund--requiring tenants to
pay rent in exchange for possession for the duration of the dispute--appears
rationally related to achieving the purpose of providing landlords with an
expeditious alternative to eviction proceedings and tenants with an opportunity
to maintain possession so long as rent is paid when properly due, §666-21 does
not violate this clause.  107 H. 73, 110 P.3d 397.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Chapter 584 did not implicate father's fundamental privacy
right to procreational autonomy, but rather father's economic interest in not
supporting his child, and although father had standing to raise an equal
protection challenge to chapter 584, that standing was based on a non-suspect
classification, i.e., the biological relationship of fathers to their children;
thus, because chapter 584 bears a rational relation to the public welfare, the
statute survives rational basis review and father's privacy and equal protection
arguments failed.  109 H. 240, 125 P.3d 461.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No procedural due process violation where prisoner was placed
and retained in administrative segregation.  7 H. App. 502, 753 P.2d 816.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by §291C&#8209;112, which rationally furthers
legitimate state interest in protecting health and welfare of public at large
by prohibiting use of vehicles parked on public property as places of
habitation during certain hours.  82 H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by use of preponderance of evidence standard of
proof for §586&#8209;5.5 as family and household members not suspect class and
rational basis underlying this standard adopted by legislature under chapter
571 for chapter 586 was to facilitate and expedite judicial issuance of
protective orders.  85 H. 197 (App.), 940 P.2d 404.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As a suspect classification or fundamental right was not
involved, and based upon dissimilar statutory treatment generally accorded to
possession of marijuana as opposed to alcohol, where there was a rational basis
for dissimilar punishment, §710&#8209;1022 did not violate defendant's right
because it imposed a more severe penalty for a prisoner's marijuana possession
than for alcohol possession under §710&#8209;1023.  92 H. 217 (App.), 990 P.2d
115.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1998 Amended Child Support Guidelines classification
challenged by father was constitutional as it reasonably calculated the child
support payable for child without regard to child support owed by the
non-custodial parent to other children, whether by a previous court order or a
non-adjudicated legal obligation, and reasonably imposed upon the non-custodial
parent the burden of proving that exceptional circumstances warrant deviation
from the calculated amount.  104 H. 449 (App.), 91 P.3d 1092.</p>
