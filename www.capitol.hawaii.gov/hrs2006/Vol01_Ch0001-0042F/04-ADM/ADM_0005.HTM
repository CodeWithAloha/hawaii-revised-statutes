<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §5.</b>  (a)  Except as provided in
subsection (c) of this section, the State of Hawaii and its political
subdivisions, as the case may be, shall succeed to the title of the Territory
of Hawaii and its subdivisions in those lands and other properties in which the
Territory and its subdivisions now hold title.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Except as provided in subsection (c) and
(d) of this section, the United States grants to the State of Hawaii, effective
upon its admission into the Union, the United States' title to all the public
lands and other public property, and to all lands defined as &quot;available
lands&quot; by section 203 of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as
amended, within the boundaries of the State of Hawaii, title to which is held
by the United States immediately prior to its admission into the Union.  The
grant hereby made shall be in lieu of any and all grants provided for new
States by provisions of law other than this Act, and such grants shall not
extend to the State of Hawaii.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Any lands and other properties that, on
the date Hawaii is admitted into the Union, are set aside pursuant to law for
the use of the United States under any (1) Act of Congress, (2) Executive
order, (3) proclamation of the President, or (4) proclamation of the Governor
of Hawaii shall remain the property of the United States subject only to the
limitations, if any, imposed under (1), (2), (3), or (4), as the case may be.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Any public lands or other public property
that is conveyed to the State of Hawaii by subsection (b) of this section but
that, immediately prior to the admission of said State into the Union, is
controlled by the United States pursuant to permit, license, or permission,
written or verbal, from the Territory of Hawaii or any department thereof may,
at any time during the five years following the admission of Hawaii into the
Union, be set aside by Act of Congress or by Executive order of the President,
made pursuant to law, for the use of the United States, and the lands or
property so set aside shall, subject only to valid rights then existing, be the
property of the United States. [Am July&nbsp;12, 1960, Pub L 86<b>-</b>624, 74
Stat 422]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Within five years from the date Hawaii is
admitted into the Union, each Federal agency having control over any land or
property that is retained by the United States pursuant to subsections (c) and
(d) of this section shall report to the President the facts regarding its
continued need for such land or property, and if the President determines that
the land or property is no longer needed by the United States it shall be
conveyed to the State of Hawaii.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The lands granted to the State of Hawaii
by subsection (b) of this section and public lands retained by the United
States under subsections (c) and (d) and later conveyed to the State under
subsection (e), together with the proceeds from the sale or other disposition
of any such lands and the income therefrom, shall be held by said State as a
public trust for the support of the public schools and other public educational
institutions, for the betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians, as
defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended, for the
development of farm and home ownership on as widespread a basis as possible for
the making of public improvements, and for the provision of lands for public
use.  Such lands, proceeds, and income shall be managed and disposed of for one
or more of the foregoing purposes in such manner as the constitution and laws
of said State may provide, and their use for any other object shall constitute
a breach of trust for which suit may be brought by the United States.  The
schools and other educational institutions supported, in whole or in part out
of such public trust shall forever remain under the exclusive control of said
State; and no part of the proceeds or income from the lands granted under this
Act shall be used for the support of any sectarian or denominational school,
college, or university.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  As used in this Act, the term &quot;lands
and other properties&quot; includes public lands and other public property, and
the term &quot;public lands and other public property&quot; means, and is
limited to, the lands and properties that were ceded to the United States by
the Republic of Hawaii under the joint resolution of annexation approved July&nbsp;7,
1898 (30 Stat. 750), or that have been acquired in exchange for lands or
properties so ceded.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  All laws of the United States reserving to
the United States the free use or enjoyment of property which vests in or is
conveyed to the State of Hawaii or its political subdivisions pursuant to
subsection (a), (b), or (e) of this section or reserving the right to alter,
amend, or repeal laws relating thereto shall cease to be effective upon the
admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 (Public
Law 31, Eighty<b>-</b>third Congress, first session; 67 Stat. 29) and the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (Public Law 212, Eighty-third Congress,
first session, 67 Stat. 462) shall be applicable to the State of Hawaii, and
the said State shall have the same rights as do existing States thereunder.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  Revised conveyance procedures.</b>  Act of
December&nbsp;23, 1963, Pub L 88-233, 77 Stat 472, provides:  That (a)(i)
whenever after August&nbsp;21, 1964, any of the public lands and other public property
as defined in section 5(g) of Public Law 86-3 (73 Stat. 4, 6), or any lands
acquired by the Territory of Hawaii and its subdivisions, which are the
property of the United States pursuant to section 5(c) or become the property
of the United States pursuant to section 5(d) of Public Law 86-3, except the
lands administered pursuant to the Act of August&nbsp;25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535),
as amended, and (ii) whenever any of the lands of the United States on Sand
Island, including the reef lands in connection therewith, in the city and
county of Honolulu, are determined to be surplus property by the Administrator
of General Services (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Administrator&quot;)
with the concurrence of the head of the department or agency exercising administration
or control over such lands and property, they shall be conveyed to the State of
Hawaii by the Administrator subject to the provisions of this Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  (b)  Such lands and property shall be conveyed without
monetary consideration, but subject to such other terms and conditions as the
Administrator may prescribe:  Provided, That, as a condition precedent to the
conveyance of such lands, the Administrator shall require payment by the State
of Hawaii of the estimated fair market value, as determined by the Administrator,
of any buildings, structures, and other improvements erected and made on such
lands after they were set aside.  In the event that the State of Hawaii does
not agree to any payment prescribed by the Administrator, he may remove,
relocate, and otherwise dispose of any such buildings, structures, and other
improvements under other applicable laws, or if the Administrator determines
that they cannot be removed without substantial damage to them or the lands
containing them, he may dispose of them and the lands involved under other
applicable laws, but, in such cases he shall pay to the State of Hawaii that
portion of any proceeds from such disposal which he estimates to be equal to
the value of the lands involved.  Nothing in this section shall prevent the
disposal by the Administrator under other applicable laws of the lands subject
to conveyance to the State of Hawaii under this section if the State of Hawaii
so chooses.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sec. 2.  Any lands, property, improvements, and proceeds
conveyed or paid to the State of Hawaii under section 1 of this Act shall be
considered a part of public trust established by section 5(f) of Public Law
86-3, and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of that trust.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Duty imposed under paragraphs (c) and (e) on federal agency
to report on its continued need of land is limited to lands ceded to U.S. upon
annexation and does not extend to lands acquired by U.S. thereafter.  U.S. Att.
Gen. Op. June&nbsp;12, 1961.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Legislature may not authorize office of Hawaiian affairs to
use funds derived from public lands trust to better the conditions of
&quot;Hawaiians&quot;, as defined in section 10-2, HRS, distinguishing from
&quot;native Hawaiians&quot; as defined in this section.  Att. Gen. Op. 83-2.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (f) expressly acknowledges that ceded or public
trust land may be alienated; proceeds of sale or disposition must be returned
to the trust and held by State for use for one or more of five purposes set
forth in subsection (f).  Att. Gen. Op. 95-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Collaboration agreement between University and corporation
requiring the University to provide the corporation with  environmental samples
from diverse habitats may be voidable but not null and void altogether if both
the corporation and the University intended that all material come from only
ceded lands the State owned.  The University could still perform under the
contract by collecting material from the lands it owns and by securing a land
license so that it could collect materials from the ceded lands the State
owns.  Att. Gen. Op. 03-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Inasmuch as the genetic material or composition of the
natural resources and things connected to public lands, including ceded lands,
are an integral part of those resources and things, title to biogenetic
resources will still be held by State if it has not sold the land.  Legal title
to biogenetic resources gathered from state public lands will not still be
vested in the State if third persons were allowed to remove from public lands
the natural resource or thing from which the biogenetic resources were
extracted or the State sold or leased title to a parcel of public land without
reserving title or retaining control of the resources or things connected to
the transferred land, or their biogenetic contents.  Att. Gen. Op. 03-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Legislature must again determine which income and proceeds
from the public land trust lands are to go to the office of Hawaiian affairs
(OHA).  Until legislature reestablishes a funding mechanism for OHA, Executive
Order No. 03-03 is the only mechanism in place for transferring receipts from
the use of ceded lands to OHA; receipts from the sale or transfer of biogenetic
resources do not qualify for transfer under the order.  Att. Gen. Op. 03-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The scope of the University's authority to sell or transfer
biogenetic resources gathered from ceded lands depends upon how the University
acquired the ceded land from which the biogenetic resource originated.  The
University has complete authority over the lands that are set aside or conveyed
to it by the State, and would have limited authority to dispose of biogenetic
resources gathered from public lands it leases from the State, or lands that it
has permits to use or licenses from which to remove materials.  Att. Gen. Op.
03-3.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Hawaii's suit in supreme court, seeking to extend duty to
acquired lands, dismissed on ground that U.S. could not be sued without its
consent.  373 U.S. 57.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Native Hawaiian group had no private cause of action under
Act; section creates federal &quot;right&quot; enforceable under 42 U.S.C.
§1983; enforcement of federal-state compact created by section presents federal
question.  764 F.2d 623.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff alleged that office of Hawaiian affairs trustees
were not spending funds pursuant to section.  915 F.2d 469.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Native Hawaiians stated federal claim by alleging that
trustees of office of Hawaiian affairs expended income derived from lands
conveyed as public trust for purposes other than those permitted under
Admission Act.  928 F.2d 824.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Native Hawaiians' claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983 that land
parcel was subject to public trust not actionable where private landowners did
not act under color of state law.  939 F.2d 702.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  OHA trustees entitled to qualified immunity from 42 U.S.C.
§1983 claim that trustees violated Admission Act by improperly using §5(f)
funds for referendum to define &quot;native Hawaiians&quot;.  3 F.3d 1220.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff had standing where plaintiff was among class of
beneficiaries whose welfare was the object of the action at issue.  3 F.3d
1220.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act does not impose upon the United States a general fiduciary
obligation to bring suit against the State for any particular alleged breach of
trust, only a right to bring such action.  45 F.3d 333.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs contended, inter alia, that phrase imposed a duty
upon United States to sue State if State breached the trust, and that state
defendants had violated and would continue to violate this section by not
giving priority to the betterment of native Hawaiians by funding homesteads for
them; judgment of district court affirmed, where court denied plaintiffs' motion
for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint against all
defendants.  183 F.3d 945.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under submerged lands act, Hawaii's boundaries extend one
marine league.  235 F. Supp. 990.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' breach of public land trust claims dismissed,
where plaintiffs claimed in their [subsection (f)] trust beneficiary capacities
that they were being treated differently from a small class of native Hawaiians
and did not proceed on the basis of any direct injury.  299 F. Supp. 2d 1090.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration denied, where
plaintiffs argued that the court erred in finding that plaintiffs lacked
standing to assert claims as beneficiaries of the public land trust created by
subsection (f).  299 F. Supp. 2d 1107.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' Hawaiian home lands lease program claim
dismissed, because plaintiffs' claim necessarily involved a challenge to the
Admission Act, a challenge that could not be brought by a party with only state
taxpayer standing.  299 F. Supp. 2d 1114.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs contended that Act 359 of 1993 Hawaii
legislature (relating to Hawaiian sovereignty), as amended in 1994 and 1996,
breached fiduciary duty between State and its citizens, and brought suit under
42 U.S.C. §1983 to enforce subsection (f), on motion for preliminary injunction,
plaintiffs not likely to prevail on their §1983 action regarding alleged
violation of Admission Act.  941 F. Supp. 1529.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' suit barred by Eleventh Amendment and prior Ninth
Circuit authority, where, inter alia, plaintiffs asked court to compel state
defendants to spend §5(f) funds on only one (Hawaiian home lands) of the five
purposes provided for in the Admission Act, in order to compensate for past
breaches of trust.  996 F. Supp. 989.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 4 of Admission Act and subsection (f) create rights
enforceable under 42 U.S.C. §1983; plaintiffs had standing to enforce such
rights.  996 F. Supp. 989.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  New lava lands created by volcanic eruption were within
&quot;public lands&quot; the title to which was granted by the federal
government to the State upon admission to statehood.  58 H. 106, 566 P.2d 725.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Claim brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983 that exchange of ceded
lands by State constituted a breach of trust under subsection (f) was barred by
statute of limitations and res judicata.  73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247.</p>
