<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §37D-2  Financing agreements</b>.  (a) 
There is hereby established and authorized the financing agreement program of
the State.  Any agency desiring to acquire or improve projects through the
financing agreement program established and authorized by this chapter shall
submit a written request to the department providing such information as the
department shall require.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, and
except for the Hawaii health systems corporation, only with the approval by the
attorney general as to form and legality and upon the written request of one or
more participating agencies may the department enter into a financing agreement
in accordance with this chapter, except that the board of regents of the
University of Hawaii may enter into a financing agreement in accordance with
this chapter without the approval of the director and of the attorney general
as to form and legality if the principal amount of the financing agreement does
not exceed $3,000,000.  A financing agreement may be entered into by the
department on behalf of one or more participating agencies at any time (before
or after commencement or completion of any improvements or acquisitions to be
financed) and shall be upon terms and conditions the department finds to be advantageous. 
In each case of a written request by the judiciary to participate in the
financing agreement program, the department shall implement the request;
provided that the related financing agreement shall be upon terms and
conditions the department finds to be advantageous.  Any financing agreement
entered into by the department without the approval required by this section
shall be void and of no effect.  A single financing agreement may finance a
single item or multiple items of property to be used by multiple agencies or
may finance a single item or multiple items of property to be used by a single
agency.  The department shall bill any participating agency that benefits from
property acquired with the proceeds of a financing agreement for such participating
agency's pro rata share of:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The department's costs of administration of the
financing agreement program; and </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The financing costs, including the principal and
interest components of the financing agreement and insurance premiums;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>on a monthly or other periodic basis, and may
deposit payments received in connection with the billings with a trustee as
security for a financing agreement.  Any participating agency receiving such a
bill shall be authorized and shall pay the amounts billed from the available
moneys.  </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Financing agreements shall be subject to
the following limitations:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Amounts payable by a participating agency to or
upon the direction of the department in respect to a project and by the
department under a financing agreement shall be limited to available moneys. 
In no circumstance shall the department be obligated to pay amounts due under a
financing agreement from any source other than available moneys.  If, by reason
of insufficient available moneys or other reason, amounts due under a financing
agreement are not paid when due, the lender may exercise any property right
that the department has granted to it in the financing agreement, against the
property that was purchased with the proceeds of the financing agreement, and
apply the amounts so received toward payments scheduled to be made by the
department under the financing agreement;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  No property rights may be granted in property
unless the property is being acquired, is to be substantially improved, is to
be refinanced with the proceeds of a financing agreement, or is land on which
the property is located;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary,
and except for the Hawaii health systems corporation and as otherwise provided
in this section with respect to the University of Hawaii, and except as
provided in chapter 323F as to the Hawaii health systems corporation, an agency
shall not have the power to enter into a financing agreement, except through
the department as authorized by this chapter, and nothing in this chapter shall
be construed to authorize the sale, lease, or other disposition of property
owned by an agency;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Except as otherwise provided in this section with
respect to the University of Hawaii, the sale, assignment, or other disposition
of any financing agreements, including certificates of participation relating
thereto, shall require the approval of the director; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The department shall not be subject to chapter
103D and any and all other requirements of law for competitive bidding for
financing agreements. [L 1996, c 119, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 41, §6; am L 1999,
c 31, §1; am L 2001, c 200, pt of §3]</p>
