<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§39A-289]  Powers with respect to and
security for special purpose revenue bonds.  </b>To secure the payment of any
of the special purpose revenue bonds issued pursuant to this part, including
interest on the bonds, or in connection with the bonds, the department shall
have the power to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Pledge all or any part of the revenues derived by
the department from the project agreement to the punctual payment of special
purpose revenue bonds issued with respect to the project financed or refinanced
from bond proceeds, including interest on the bonds, and to covenant against
pledging any revenues or receipts to any other bonds or any other obligations
of the department for any other purpose, except as otherwise stated in the law
providing for the issuance of additional special purpose revenue bonds to be
equally and ratably secured by a lien upon the revenues;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Pledge and assign the interest of the department
under the project agreement and other related agreements and the rights,
duties, and obligations of the department thereunder, including the right to
receive revenues;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Covenant as to the use and disposition of the
proceeds from the sale of the bonds;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Covenant to set aside or pay over reserves and
sinking funds for the bonds and as to the disposition thereof;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Covenant and prescribe as to what occurrences
shall constitute &quot;events of default&quot; and the terms and conditions
upon which any or all of the bonds shall become or may be declared due before
maturity and as to the terms and conditions upon which the declaration and its
consequences may be waived;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Covenant as to the rights, liabilities, powers,
and duties arising upon the breach by the department of any covenant,
condition, or obligation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Designate a national or state bank or trust company
within or without the State, incorporated in the United States, to serve as
trustee for the holders of the special purpose revenue bonds and to enter into
a trust indenture or trust agreement or indenture of mortgage with the
trustee.  The trustee may be authorized by the department to receive and
receipt for, hold, and administer the proceeds of the special purpose revenue
bonds issued for the project and to apply the proceeds to the purposes for
which the bonds are issued, or to receive and receipt for, hold, and administer
the revenues derived by the department under the project agreement and to apply
the revenues to the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds, or
both, and any excess revenues to the payment of expenses incurred by the State
in administering the bonds or in carrying out the project agreement.  If a
trustee is appointed, any trust indenture or trust agreement or indenture of
mortgage entered into by the department with the trustee may contain whatever
covenants and provisions as may be necessary, convenient, or desirable to
secure the bonds.  The department may pledge and assign to the trustee the
interest of the department under the project agreement and other related
agreements as well as the rights, duties, and obligations of the department
thereunder, including the right to receive revenues thereunder.  The department
may appoint the trustee to serve as fiscal agent for the payment of the
principal and interest and for the purchase, registration, transfer, exchange,
and redemption of the special purpose revenue bonds.  The department may also
authorize and empower the trustee to perform functions with respect to payment,
purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption as the department
may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient, including, without limitation, the
holding of the special purpose revenue bonds and coupons that have been paid
and the supervision of the destruction of the bonds and coupons according to
the law;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Execute all instruments necessary or convenient
in the exercise of the powers herein granted or in the performance of its
covenants and duties; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  Make covenants and perform any acts as may be
necessary, convenient, or desirable to secure the bonds, although such
covenants, acts, or items may not be enumerated here.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>The department may do all things in the issuance of
the bonds and for their security that are consistent with the Constitution of
the State of Hawaii. [L 2006, c 102, pt of §2]</p>
