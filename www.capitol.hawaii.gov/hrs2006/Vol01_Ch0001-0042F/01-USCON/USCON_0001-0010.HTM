<p class=XNotesHeading>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Obligation of contracts.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Milk control legislation enacted within the proper exercise
of a State's police powers will not be declared unconstitutional even though it
may impair the obligation of a pre-existing contract.  Att. Gen. Op. 67-10.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Title of nobility.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section prohibits the states from granting titles of royalty
upon their citizens.  Att. Gen. Op. 68-20.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Ex post facto law.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Law requiring reporting of campaign contributions made before
effective date of act was not an ex post facto law.  Att. Gen. Op. 73-17.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Import-export.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Hawaii's general excise and use taxes do not constitute an
improper &quot;Impost or Duty&quot; under the import-export clause.  Att. Gen.
Op. 94-2.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Law Journals and Reviews</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  For discussion of contracts clause, see Hawaii's Land Reform
Act:  Is it Constitutional?  6 HBJ 31.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Contract Clause:  The &quot;Regulated Industry&quot;
Exception.  8 UH L. Rev. 135.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Kapiolani Park Preservation Society v. City and County of
Honolulu:  The Lease of Public Park Land as a Breach of a Charitable Trust.  11
UH L. Rev. 199.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Bill of attainder.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs, owners of leasehold interests in a condominium
complex, did not meet the burden of establishing that the savings clause of the
ordinance which repealed chapter 38 of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu
constituted a bill of attainder.  378 F. Supp. 2d 1258.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Obligation of contracts.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  District court did not abuse its discretion in granting
plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, where court granted a
preliminary injunction against operation of Act 355, L 1997  (which amended
§78-13), State's &quot;pay lag&quot; law, on the ground that it impaired the
obligations of the employees' collective bargaining agreement in violation of
the contract clause.  183 F.3d 1096.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction granted,
where  plaintiffs filed motion seeking to enjoin defendants from delaying
payroll under Act 355, L 1997 (which amended §78-13), with respect to
University of Hawaii faculty members, arguing that Act 355 violated the
contract clause because a five-day delay in pay violated the collective
bargaining agreement between the State and the faculty members at the
University.  16 F. Supp. 2d 1242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was no existing contract that Act 355, L 1997
(amending §78-13), impaired, no contracts clause violation possible and
injunction no longer needed; the case was moot.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The contracts clause cannot be used under the circumstances
to invalidate the repeal of chapter 38 of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu,
because the reserved powers doctrine reserves essential attributes of
sovereignty such as the power of eminent domain to the discretion of the
states.  378 F. Supp. 2d 1249; 378 F. Supp. 2d 1258.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Zoning regulations did not impair development contract but
only affected property which was subject matter of contract.  649 F. Supp. 926.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The legislature may alter or abolish public positions.  48 H.
370, 405 P.2d 772.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State law requiring lessor to purchase leasehold improvements
upon termination of lease unconstitutionally impairs obligation of preexisting
lease contract.  69 H. 112, 736 P.2d 55.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Clause does not prohibit execution of state laws on Hawaiian
home lands merely because Congress has not expressed its consent to the
exercise of such enforcement power.  80 H. 168, 907 P.2d 754.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation by repeal of court reporter temporary
certification rule where repeal did not substantially impair plaintiff's
contractual relationships, repeal served a significant and legitimate public
purpose, and was reasonably and narrowly drawn.  82 H. 329, 922 P.2d 942.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Ex post facto law.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by rule that, for purposes of criminal history
calculation, state conviction for conduct which occurred after defendant's
federal offense, but for which defendant was sentenced before defendant's
sentencing on the federal offense, is counted as a prior sentence.  44 F.3d
749.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Inmates' claim that sex offender treatment program violated
ex post facto clause was ripe; sex offender treatment program did not violate
ex post facto clause.  131 F.3d 818.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Prison's policy of not placing untreated sex offenders in
minimum custody did not violate ex post facto clause.  905 F. Supp. 813.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  General definition of.  50 H. 351, 440 P.2d 528.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1964 amendments to the negligent homicide statute, as applied
to prior wrongdoers, were not ex post facto.  50 H. 351, 440 P.2d 528.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Law providing for increased punishment for repeat offenders,
was not violative of the ex post facto clause.  61 H. 262, 602 P.2d 914.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Retrospective application of §291-4, as amended by Act 128, L
1993, did not violate ex post facto clause.  76 H. 360, 878 P.2d 699.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Chapter 846E not violative of this clause as legislature's
express purpose was for chapter to be remedial rather than punitive and
statutory scheme is not so punitive as to negate the State's remedial purpose. 
105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Import-export.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation in exempting certain locally produced products
from liquor tax.  65 H. 566, 656 P.2d 724.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Duty of tonnage.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Mooring and anchoring fees imposed by state regulations not a
duty of tonnage.  42 F.3d 1185.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs argued that mooring and anchoring fees
charged by State were duty of tonnage in violation of this section, plaintiffs'
Article I challenge denied.  823 F. Supp. 766.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Division of boating and ocean recreation's assessment of a
two per cent ocean recreation management area fee against vessel was an
impermissible tax in violation of prohibition against tonnage duties; two per
cent use fee assessed other vessel was not a prohibited duty of tonnage.  195
F. Supp. 2d 1157.</p>
