<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §10.  Construction of existing statutes.</b> 
That all rights of action, suits at law and in equity, prosecutions, and
judgments existing prior to the taking effect of this Act shall continue to be
as effectual as if this Act had not been passed; and those in favor of or
against the Republic of Hawaii, and not assumed by or transferred to the United
States, shall be equally valid in favor of or against the government of the
Territory of Hawaii.  All offenses which by statute then in force were
punishable as offenses against the Republic of Hawaii shall be punishable as
offenses against the government of the Territory of Hawaii, unless such statute
is inconsistent with this Act, or shall be repealed or changed by law.  No
person shall be subject to imprisonment for nonpayment of taxes nor for debt. 
All criminal and penal proceedings then pending in the courts of the Republic
of Hawaii shall be prosecuted to final judgment and execution in the name of
the Territory of Hawaii; all such proceedings, all actions at law, suits in
equity, and other proceedings then pending in the courts of the Republic of
Hawaii shall be carried on to final judgment and execution in the corresponding
courts of the Territory of Hawaii; and all process issued and sentences imposed
before this Act takes effect shall be as valid as if issued or imposed in the
name of the Territory of Hawaii:  Provided, That no suit or proceedings shall
be maintained for the specific performance of any contract heretofore or
hereafter entered into for personal labor or service, nor shall any remedy
exist or be enforced for breach of any such contract, except in a civil suit or
proceeding instituted solely to recover damages for such breach:  Provided
further, That the provisions of this section shall not modify or change the
laws of the United States applicable to merchant seamen.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     That all contracts made since August twelfth,
eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, by which persons are held for service for a
definite term, are hereby declared null and void and terminated, and no law
shall be passed to enforce said contracts in any way; and it shall be the duty
of the United States marshal to at once notify such persons so held of the
termination of their contracts. [Am June&nbsp;27, 1952, c 477, §403(a), 66 Stat
279]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Compare Const. of 1894, Art. 92, §§1-3.  Admiralty cases were
included in &quot;other proceedings&quot; under this §, and those then pending
continued in the jurisdiction of the territorial courts, though subsequent ones
could be brought only in the federal court, and no appeal lay in such pending
cases to the federal circuit court of appeals:  13 H. 174; 108 Fed. 113; 183
U.S. 545; 187 U.S. 309.  A petition in 1904 for the removal of a guardian
appointed in 1899 is in a proceeding pending in 1899: 197 U.S. 354.  An action
by the Territory for taxes due the Republic is not barred:  18 H. 255. 
Imprisonment, for contempt, to compel an administrator to pay creditors pro
rata is not imprisonment for debt:  19 H. 234; but the execution of a writ of
ne exeat, in assumpsit, to obtain security for a judgment that might be
recovered would be such imprisonment:  15 H. 413.</p>

<p class=XNotes><span style='font-family:Courier'>  </span>Inhibition against
suit on contract for personal service except for damage<span style='font-family:
Courier'>s for breach, does not prevent injunction against exhibition or
dealing in moving pictures in violation of contract:  22 H. 550; nor does this
provision apply to a contract to have one cultivate on shares land in sugar
cane for three crops in a husbandlike manner to the satisfaction of another: 
25 H. 558.  On contract labor laws, see note to Joint Resolution of Annexation
RLH 1955, page 13.  On applicability to Hawaii of Federal laws against
introduction of contract labor, see 27 Ops. 479.  Referred to in 16 H. 245,
255; 18 H. 539; 20 H. 487; 22 H. 587; 197 U.S. 354; 1 U.S.D.C. Haw. 41.</span></p>
