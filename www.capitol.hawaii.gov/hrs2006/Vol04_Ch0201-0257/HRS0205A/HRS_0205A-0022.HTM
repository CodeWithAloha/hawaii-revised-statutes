<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Special management area&quot; must be shoreline or
coastal water related land.  Att. Gen. Op. 75-18.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where no express procedure provided in Maui charter or Maui
special management area rules for appeal of Maui planning director's decision
on a minor permit application to the Maui planning commission, and commission
delegated authority to render final decision on minor permit applications to
director pursuant to this section, director's decision not to process
developer's application was a final decision equivalent to a denial of the
application and was thus appealable under §91-14(a).  88 H. 108, 962 P.2d 367.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant's tour boat operation changed the intensity
of use of water in the Hanalei special management area, defendant's tour boat
operation constituted a &quot;development&quot;, within the meaning of this
section, that was not exempt from the coastal zone management act or special
management area rules.  89 H. 400, 974 P.2d 40.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Special management area minor permit issued by county to
public utility invalid and public utility required to obtain special management
area use permit for its cellular telephone tower where county board of appeals
finding that valuation of tower development did not exceed $125,000 was clearly
erroneous.  90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where land lease did not constitute a &quot;development&quot;
under this chapter, trial court erred in ruling that valuation of cellular
telephone tower development must include value of the land lease; instead,
valuation consisted of the &quot;current replacement cost&quot; of the
structures built.  90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where developer's proposed subdivision fell within the
definition of &quot;development&quot; found in this section, trial court
correctly determined that a special management area use permit was required. 
109 H. 384, 126 P.3d 1071.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Development&quot; includes that which is planned.  4 H.
App. 304, 666 P.2d 177.</p>
