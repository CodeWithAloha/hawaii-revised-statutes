financial institution may not, directly or indirectly:</p>

replacement, or servicing of the leased property during the lease term;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Purchase parts and accessories in bulk or

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Purchase insurance for the lessee;</p>

financial institution must recover the lessor's full investment in the
property, plus the estimated total cost of financing the property, shall be
forty years; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  At the expiration of the lease (including any
renewals or extensions with the same lessee), all interest in the property
shall be either liquidated or leased again on a nonoperating basis as soon as
practicable (in no event later than two years from the expiration of the
lease), but in no case shall the lessor retain any interest in the property
beyond fifty years after the lessor's acquisition of the property. [L 1992, c
106, §4]</p>
