<div class=Section1>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§235-110.92]  Drought mitigating water
storage facility; income tax credit.  </b>(a)  There shall be allowed to each
eligible taxpayer subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter, an income tax
credit, which shall be deductible from the eligible taxpayer's net income tax
liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the
credit is properly claimed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The amount of the credit shall be four per cent
of the qualifying costs incurred and paid by the eligible taxpayer during the
taxable year for each qualified water storage facility in the State, and shall
not include construction or repair costs for which another credit was claimed
under this chapter for the taxable year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In the case of a partnership, S corporation,
estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for qualifying costs incurred and
paid by the entity for the taxable year.  The cost upon which the tax credit is
computed shall be determined at the entity level.  Distribution and share of
credit shall be determined pursuant to section 235-110.7(a).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If a deduction is taken under section 179 (with
respect to election to expense depreciable business assets) of the Internal
Revenue Code, no tax credit shall be allowed for that portion of the
construction or repair costs for which the deduction is taken.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The basis of eligible property for depreciation
or accelerated cost recovery system purposes for state income taxes shall be
reduced by the amount of credit allowable and claimed.  In the alternative, the
taxpayer shall treat the amount of the credit allowable and claimed as taxable
income for the taxable year in which it is properly recognized under the method
of accounting used to compute taxable income.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The credit allowed under this section
shall be claimed against the net income tax liability for the taxable year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the tax credit under this section
exceeds the eligible taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of the credits
over liability shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided that no refunds or
payment on account of the tax credit allowed by this section shall be made for
amounts less than $1.  All claims, including any amended claims, for a tax
credit under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth
month following the close of the taxable years for which the credit may be
claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a
waiver of the right to claim the credit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The director of taxation shall prepare any
forms that may be necessary to claim a credit under this section.  The director
may also require the taxpayer to furnish information to ascertain the validity
of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary
to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The credit allowed under this section
shall be available for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2000,
and shall not be available for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31,
2005.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  As used in this section:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Eligible taxpayer&quot; means a taxpayer
who:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Is a farmer or rancher; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Is not claimed or is not otherwise eligible to be
claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer for Hawaii state income tax
purposes.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Net income tax liability&quot; means net
income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Qualified water storage facility&quot;
means a water storage facility that is part of a conservation plan approved by
the local soil and water conservation district.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Qualifying costs&quot; means any cost
incurred and paid by the taxpayer after December&nbsp;31, 2000, for the new
construction of a qualified water storage facility or the repair or
reconstruction of an existing qualified water storage facility, including the
costs of new equipment related to the construction or repair of the new or
existing qualified water storage facility, but does not include amounts
received through grant or subsidy from any federal or state government. [L
2001, c 293, §2]</p>
