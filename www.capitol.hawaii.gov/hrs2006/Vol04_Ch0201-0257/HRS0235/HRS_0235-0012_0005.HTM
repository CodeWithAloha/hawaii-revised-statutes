<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§235-12.5  Renewable energy technologies;
income tax credit.  </b>(a)  When the requirements of subsection (c) are met,
each individual or corporate resident taxpayer that files an individual or
corporate net income tax return for a taxable year may claim a tax credit under
this section against the Hawaii state individual or corporate net income tax. 
The tax credit may be claimed for every eligible renewable energy technology
system that is installed and placed in service by a taxpayer during the taxable
year.  This credit shall be available for systems installed and placed in
service after June 30, 2003.  The tax credit may be claimed as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Solar thermal energy systems for:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Single-family residential property: 
thirty-five per cent of the actual cost or $2,250, whichever is less;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Multi-family residential property: 
thirty-five per cent of the actual cost or $350 per unit, whichever is less;
and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Commercial property:  thirty-five per cent
of the actual cost or $250,000, whichever is less;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Wind-powered energy systems for:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Single-family residential property: 
twenty per cent of the actual cost or $1,500, whichever is less;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Multi-family residential property:  twenty
per cent of the actual cost or $200 per unit, whichever is less; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Commercial property:  twenty per cent of
the actual cost or $500,000, whichever is less; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Photovoltaic energy systems for:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Single-family residential property: 
thirty-five per cent of the actual cost or $5,000, whichever is less;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Multi-family residential property: 
thirty-five per cent of the actual cost or $350 per unit, whichever is less;
and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Commercial property:  thirty-five per cent
of the actual cost or $500,000, whichever is less;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that multiple owners of a single system
shall be entitled to a single tax credit; and provided further that the tax
credit shall be apportioned between the owners in proportion to their
contribution to the cost of the system.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate,
or trust, the tax credit allowable is for every eligible renewable energy
technology system that is installed and placed in service by the entity.  The
cost upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity
level.  Distribution and share of credit shall be determined pursuant to
section 235-110.7(a).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  For the purposes of this section:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Actual cost&quot; means costs related to
the renewable energy technology systems under subsection (a), including
accessories and installation, but not including the cost of consumer incentive
premiums unrelated to the operation of the system or offered with the sale of
the system and costs for which another credit is claimed under this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Renewable energy technology system&quot;
means a new system that captures and converts a renewable source of energy,
such as wind, heat (solar thermal), or light (photovoltaic) from the sun into:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A usable source of thermal or mechanical energy;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Electricity; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Fuel.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Solar or wind energy system&quot; means
any identifiable facility, equipment, apparatus, or the like that converts
insolation or wind energy to useful thermal or electrical energy for heating,
cooling, or reducing the use of other types of energy that are dependent upon
fossil fuel for their generation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  For taxable years beginning after December
31, 2005, the dollar amount of any utility rebate shall be deducted from the
cost of the qualifying system and its installation before applying the state
tax credit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The director of taxation shall prepare any
forms that may be necessary to claim a tax credit under this section, including
forms identifying the technology type of each tax credit claimed under this
section, whether for solar thermal, photovoltaic from the sun, or wind.  The
director may also require the taxpayer to furnish reasonable information to
ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may
adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to
chapter 91.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  If the tax credit under this section
exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of the credit over
liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax liability
in subsequent years until exhausted.  All claims for the tax credit under this
section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the
twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may
be claimed.  Failure to comply with this subsection shall constitute a waiver
of the right to claim the credit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  By or before December, 2005, to the extent
feasible, using existing resources to assist the energy-efficiency policy
review and evaluation, the department shall assist with data collection on the
following:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The number of renewable energy technology systems
that have qualified for a tax credit during the past year by:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Technology type (solar thermal,
photovoltaic from the sun, and wind); and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Taxpayer type (corporate and individual);
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The total cost of the tax credit to the State
during the past year by:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Technology type; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Taxpayer type. [L 2003, c 207, §§2, 4; am
L 2004, c 97, §1; am L 2006, c 240, §§2, 3]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Note</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  The 2006 amendment applies to taxable years beginning
after December 31, 2005, provided that the increased tax credits under this
section shall be available only to eligible renewable energy technology systems
installed after July 1, 2006.  L 2006, c 240, §17.</p>
