<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §206E-3  Hawaii community development
authority; established.</b>  (a)  There is established the Hawaii community
development authority, which shall be a body corporate and a public
instrumentality of the State, for the purpose of implementing this chapter.  The
authority shall be placed within the department of business, economic
development, and tourism for administrative purposes.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (b)  The
authority shall consist of thirteen voting members.  The director of finance,
the director of business, economic development, and tourism, the comptroller,
and the director of transportation, or their respective designated
representatives shall serve as ex officio, voting members.  One member shall be
appointed by the governor from a list of not less than three prospective
appointees submitted by the president of the senate, and one member shall be
appointed by the governor from a list of not less than three prospective
appointees submitted by the speaker of the house of representatives.  Seven
members shall be appointed by the governor for staggered terms pursuant to
section 26-34; provided that four members shall be appointed at large and,
initially, three members, hereinafter referred to as county members, shall be
selected from a list of ten prospective appointees recommended by the local
governing body of the county in which the initial designated district is
situated; and provided further that when vacancies occur in any of the three
positions for which the members were selected from a list of county
recommendations, the governor shall fill such vacancies on the basis of one
from a list of four recommendations, two from a list of seven recommendations,
or three from a list of ten recommendations.  The list of recommendations shall
be made by the local governing body of the county.  If an additional district
is designated by the legislature, the total membership of the authority shall
be increased as prescribed above by the appointment of three additional
members, except as provided for in section 206E-191.  Notwithstanding section
92-15, a majority of all members shall constitute a quorum to do business, and
the concurrence of a majority of all members shall be necessary to make any
action of the authority valid; except that, on any matter relating solely to a
specific community development district, the members representing districts
other than that specific community development district shall neither vote, nor
shall they be counted to constitute a quorum, and concurrence shall be required
of a majority of that portion of the authority made up of all ex officio voting
members, members at large, and county and district members representing the
district for which action is being proposed in order for such action to be
valid.  All members shall continue in office until their respective successors
have been appointed and qualified.  Except as herein provided, no member
appointed under this subsection shall be an officer or employee of the State or
its political subdivisions.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The authority shall appoint the executive
director who shall be the chief executive officer.  The authority shall set the
salary of the executive director, who shall serve at the pleasure of the
authority and shall be exempt from chapter 76.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The authority shall annually elect the
chairperson and vice chairperson from among its members.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The members of the authority appointed
under subsection (b) shall serve without compensation, but each shall be
reimbursed for expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the performance
of their duties. [L 1976, c 153, pt of §1; am L 1983, c 180, §1; am L 1987, c
