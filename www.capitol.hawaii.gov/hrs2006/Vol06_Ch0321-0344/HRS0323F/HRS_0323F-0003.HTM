<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §323F-3  Corporation board.</b>  (a)  The
corporation shall be governed by a thirteen-member board of directors which
shall carry out the duties and responsibilities of the corporation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Ten members of the corporation board shall
be appointed by the governor as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  One member from region I who resides in the city
and county of Honolulu;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  One member from region II who resides in the
county of Kauai;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  One member from region III who resides in the
county of Maui;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  One member from region IV who resides in the
eastern section of the county of Hawaii;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  One member from region V who resides in the
western section of the county of Hawaii;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  One member from region II who resides in the
county of Kauai or from region III who resides in the district of Hana or on
the island of Lanai; provided that in no event shall the member be appointed
from the same region for two consecutive terms; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Four at-large members who reside in the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The eleventh member shall be the chairperson of
the executive public health facility management advisory committee, who shall
serve as an ex officio, voting member.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The twelfth member, who shall serve as a voting
member, shall be a physician with active medical staff privileges at one of the
corporation's public health facilities.  The physician member shall serve a
term of two years.  The initial physician member shall be from region II, and
subsequent physician members shall come from regions IV, III, and V
respectively.  The physician member position shall continue to rotate in this
order.  The physician member shall be appointed to the corporation board by a
simple majority vote of the members of the executive public health facility
management advisory committee from a list of qualified nominees submitted by
the public health facility management advisory committee for the region from
which the physician member is to be chosen.  If for any reason a physician
member is unable to serve a full term, the remainder of that term shall be
filled by a physician from the same region.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The thirteenth member shall be the director of
health or the director's designee, who shall serve as an ex officio, voting
member.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Appointments to the corporation board, with the
exception of the chairperson of the executive public health facility management
advisory committee and the regional physician member, shall be made by the
governor, subject to confirmation by the senate pursuant to section 26-34. 
Prior to the transfer date, the public health facility management advisory committees
appointed pursuant to section 323-66 for each county may recommend names to the
governor for each position on the corporation board designated for a region
which corresponds to its county.  After the transfer date, the public health
facility management advisory committees appointed pursuant to section 323F-10
for each region may make such recommendations to the governor.  The appointed
board members shall serve for a term of four years; provided that upon the
initial appointment of the first ten members:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Two at-large members shall be appointed for a
term of two years;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Three at-large members shall be appointed for a
term of three years; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Five regional members shall be appointed for a
term of four years.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>Any vacancy shall be filled in the same manner
provided for the original appointments.  The corporation board shall elect its
own chair from among its members.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The selection, appointment, and
confirmation of any nominee shall be based on ensuring that board members have
diverse and beneficial perspectives and experiences and that they include, to
the extent possible, representatives of the medical, business, management, law,
finance, and health sectors, and patients or consumers.  Members of the board
shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for actual expenses,
including travel expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Any member of the board may be removed for
cause by the governor or for cause by vote of a two-thirds majority of the
board's members then in office.  For purposes of this section, cause shall
include without limitation:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Malfeasance in office;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Failure to attend regularly called meetings;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Sentencing for conviction of a felony, to the
extent allowed by section 831-2; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Any other cause that may render a member
incapable or unfit to discharge the duties required under this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>Filing nomination papers for elective office or
appointment to elective office, or conviction of a felony consistent with
section 831-3.1, shall automatically and immediately disqualify a board member
from office. [L 1996, c 262, pt of §2; am L 1997, c 265, §1; am L 1998, c 229,
§4]</p>
