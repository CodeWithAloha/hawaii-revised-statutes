<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Provision excluding welfare recipients from receiving medical
coverage under no-fault automobile insurance policies violated medicaid
provision of Social Security Act.  928 F.2d 898.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Vehicle was &quot;uninsured&quot; where vehicle operator's
liability insurance did not cover injured passenger and vehicle owner had no
insurance.  807 F. Supp. 98.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Households of plaintiff and spouse were separate and not a
family unit for purposes of paragraph (11).  812 F. Supp. 1083.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where named insured is a corporation, son of
officer/shareholder of corporation is not an &quot;insured&quot; under
paragraph (11).  816 F. Supp. 633.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insurer not obligated to defend or indemnify insured, or
otherwise pay any sums to defendants; defendant's shooting was no accident from
insured's viewpoint or perspective.  834 F. Supp. 329.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where insurer contended that plaintiff lacked standing to
bring bad faith claim because plaintiff, a covered person under taxicab owner's
insurance contract, was not defined as an insured in no-fault insurance
statute, plaintiff, a third party beneficiary of taxicab owner's policy, was
essentially an insured and to treat plaintiff otherwise made no sense.  947 F.
Supp. 429.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because police officer's injuries did not arise out of the
use of a vehicle, there was no uninsured motorist coverage under either of the
two policies at issue.  Officer had argued that  officer's injuries arose out
of three &quot;uses&quot; of automobiles, e.g., officer was &quot;using&quot; a
vehicle by trying to &quot;secure&quot; it.  187 F. Supp. 2d 1231.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court erred in concluding that insurance company did
not owe defendant duty to defend or indemnify on basis that shooting did not
arise out of a motor vehicle &quot;accident&quot;.  74 H. 620, 851 P.2d 321.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Car rental company not an &quot;insurer&quot; as defined
under paragraph (5).  82 H. 351, 922 P.2d 964.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where self-insurer rent-a-car company not an
&quot;insurer&quot; as defined in this section, court erred in granting
attorney's fees and costs under §431:10-242.  85 H. 243, 942 P.2d 507.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insofar as Hawaii administrative rule §16-23-11 conflicted
with paragraph (10)(B) (1987) by limiting survivors' benefits to $15,000
despite the presence of expanded no-fault coverage, §16-23-11 was void as a
matter of law.  88 H. 344, 966 P.2d 1070.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Facts and circumstances of the case demonstrated that
plaintiff was temporarily absent from father's home while attending college in
Hawaii at the time of the accident; thus, trial court did not err in concluding
that plaintiff was a resident of plaintiff's father's, the named insured's
household in California and therefore a covered person under the insurance
policy for underinsured motorist benefits.  107 H. 192, 111 P.3d 601.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits under
Hawaii motor vehicle insurance law where an &quot;uninsured motor vehicle&quot;
as defined in this section was not involved in causing plaintiff's injuries. 
81 H. 110 (App.), 912 P.2d 607.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Pursuant to §431:10C-304(1)(B) (1987) and paragraph (10)(B)
(1987), upon the death of an insured, the insurer is obligated to provide the
insured's survivor a survivor's loss benefit of up to either (1) $15,000 where
the insured has purchased only the basic no-fault coverage, or (2) the expanded
limits of no-fault benefits where the insured has contracted for it under an
optional additional coverage.  88 H. 345 (App.), 966 P.2d 1071.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under paragraph (10)(A) (1993), no-fault benefits are
expenses which are appropriate, reasonable and necessarily incurred and are not
restricted to treatment characterized as &quot;curative&quot; as opposed to
&quot;palliative&quot;.  90 H. 213 (App.), 978 P.2d 179.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As motorcycles are excluded from the definition of
&quot;motor vehicle&quot; under this section, appellant's accident with a
motorcycle was not a &quot;motor vehicle accident&quot; under the definition
set forth in this section; appellant was thus not entitled to no-fault benefits
under §431:10C-303(a) (1993).  91 H. 299 (App.), 983 P.2d 200.</p>
