<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§431:16-209  Assessments.</b>  (a)  For the
purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of
the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers,
separately for each account, at such time and for such amounts as the board
finds necessary.  Assessments shall be due not less than thirty days after
prior written notice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at
eighteen per cent per annum on and after the due date.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  There shall be two assessments, as
follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Class A assessments shall be made for the purpose
of meeting administrative and legal costs, and other expenses and examinations
conducted under the authority of section 431:16-212(e).  Class A assessments
may be made whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent
insurer.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Class B assessments shall be made to the extent
necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under section
431:16-208 with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>  (c)(1)  The amount of any Class A assessment shall be
determined by the board of directors and may be made on a pro rata or non-pro
rata basis.  If pro rata, the board of directors may provide that it be
credited against future Class B assessments.  A non-pro rata assessment shall
not exceed $150 per member insurer in any one calendar year.  The amount of any
Class B assessment shall be allocated for assessment purposes among the
accounts pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums
or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed
by the board of directors in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable
under the circumstances.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Class B assessments against member insurers for
each account shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business
in this State by each assessed member insurer [on] policies or contracts
covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which
information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became
impaired or insolvent, as the case may be, bears to such premiums received on
business in this State for such calendar years by all assessed member insurers.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of
the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be
made until necessary to implement the purposes of this part.  Classification of
assessments under subsection (b) and computation of assessments under this
subsection shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that
exact determinations may not always be possible.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The association may abate or defer, in
whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the
board of directors, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the
member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.  In the event an
assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part,
the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed
against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for
assessments set forth in this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The total of all assessments upon a member
insurer for each account shall not in any one calendar year exceed two per cent
of such insurer's average premiums received in this State on the policies and
contracts covered by the account during the three calendar years preceding the
year in which the insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.  If the
maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in any
account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount
sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary
additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The board of directors may provide in the plan
of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one
or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be
insufficient to cover anticipated claims.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The board may, by an equitable method as
established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion
to the contribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the
assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry
out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to
that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net
realized gains and income from investments.  A reasonable amount may be
retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the
association and for future losses.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  It shall be proper for any member insurer,
in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of
insurance within the scope of this part, to consider the amount reasonably
necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The association shall issue to each
insurer paying an assessment under this part, other than Class A assessment, a
certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, for the
amount of the assessment so paid.  All outstanding certificates shall be of
equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue.  A
certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial
statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of
time as the commissioner may approve. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</p>
