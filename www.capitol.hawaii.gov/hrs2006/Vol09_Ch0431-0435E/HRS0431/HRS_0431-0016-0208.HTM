<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§431:16-208  Powers and duties of the
association.</b>  (a)  If a member insurer is an impaired domestic insurer, the
association may, in its discretion, and subject to any conditions imposed by
the association that do not impair the contractual obligations of the impaired
insurer, that are approved by the commissioner, and that are, except in cases
of court ordered conservation or rehabilitation, also approved by the impaired
insurer:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Guarantee, assume or reinsure, or cause to be
guaranteed, assumed or reinsured, any or all of the policies or contracts of
the impaired insurer;</p>

of the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer pending action under
subsection (a)(1); or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Loan money to the impaired insurer.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>  (b)(1)  If a member insurer is an impaired insurer,
whether domestic, foreign, or alien, and the insurer is not paying claims
timely, then subject to the preconditions specified in paragraph (2), the
association shall, in its discretion, either:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Take any of the actions specified in
subsection (a), subject to the conditions therein, or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Provide substitute benefits in lieu of the
contractual obligations of the impaired insurer solely for:  accident and
health or sickness claims, periodic annuity benefit payments, death benefits,
supplemental benefits, and cash withdrawals for policy or contract owners who
petition therefor under claims of emergency or hardship in accordance with
standards proposed by the association and approved by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The association shall be subject to the
requirements of paragraph (1) only if:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  The laws of the impaired insurer's state
of domicile provide that until all payments of or on account of the impaired
insurer's contractual obligations by all guaranty associations, along with all
expenses thereof and interest on all such payments and expenses, shall have
been repaid to the guaranty associations or a plan of repayment by the impaired
insurer shall have been approved by the guaranty associations;</p>

<p class=iClause>              (i)  The delinquency proceeding shall not be
dismissed;</p>

<p class=iClause>             (ii)  Neither the impaired insurer nor its assets
shall be returned to the control of its shareholders or private management; and</p>

<p class=iClause>            (iii)  It shall not be permitted to solicit or
accept new business or have any suspended or revoked license restored; and</p>

<p class=iClause>          (B)  (i)  If the impaired insurer is a domestic
insurer, it has been placed under an order of rehabilitation by a court of
competent jurisdiction in this State, or;</p>

<p class=iClause>             (ii)  If the impaired insurer is a foreign or
alien insurer:</p>

<p class=iClause style='margin-left:175.5pt;text-indent:-171.0pt'>                  (I)  It
has been prohibited from soliciting or accepting new business in this State,</p>

<p class=iClause style='margin-left:175.5pt;text-indent:-171.0pt'>                 (II)  Its
certificate of authority has been suspended or revoked in this State, and</p>

<p class=iClause style='margin-left:175.5pt;text-indent:-171.0pt'>                (III)  A
petition for rehabilitation or liquidation has been filed in a court of
competent jurisdiction in its state of domicile by the commissioner of the
state.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If a member insurer is an insolvent
insurer, the association shall, in its discretion, either:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>     (1)  (A)  Guarantee, assume, or reinsure, or cause
to be guaranteed, assumed, or reinsured, the policies or contracts of the
insolvent insurer; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Assure payment of the contractual
obligations of the insolvent insurer; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Provide such moneys, pledges, guarantees,
or other means as are reasonably necessary to discharge such duties; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  With respect only to life and accident and health
or sickness insurance policies, provide benefits and coverages in accordance
with subsection (d).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  When proceeding under subsection (b)(1)(B)
or (c)(2), the association shall, with respect to only life and accident and
health or sickness insurance policies:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Assure payment of benefits for premiums identical
to the premiums and benefits (except for terms of conversion and renewability)
that would have been payable under the policies of the insolvent insurer, for
claims incurred:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  With respect to group policies, not later
than the earlier of the next renewal date under such policies or contracts or
forty-five days, but in no event less than thirty days, after the date on which
the association becomes obligated with respect to such policies;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  With respect to individual policies, not
later than the earlier of the next renewal date (if any) under such policies or
one year, but in no event less than thirty days, from the date on which the
association becomes obligated with respect to such policies.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Make diligent efforts to provide all known
insureds or group policyholders with respect to group policies thirty days'
notice of the termination of the benefits provided; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  With respect to individual policies, make
available to each known insured, or owner if other than the insured, and with
respect to an individual formerly insured under a group policy who is not
eligible for replacement group coverage, make available substitute coverage on
an individual basis in<i> </i>accordance with paragraph (4), if the insureds
had a right under law or the terminated policy to convert coverage to
individual coverage or to continue an individual policy in force until a
specified age or for a specified time, during which the insurer had no right
unilaterally to make changes in any provision of the policy or had a right only
to make changes in premium by class.    </p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>     (4)  (A)  In providing the substitute coverage
required under paragraph (3), the association may offer either to reissue the
terminated coverage or to issue an alternative policy.</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Alternative or reissued policies shall be
offered without requiring evidence of insurability, and shall not provide for
any waiting period or exclusion that would not have applied under the
terminated policy.</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  The association may reinsure any
alternative or reissued policy.</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>     (5)  (A)  Alternative policies adopted by the
association shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner.  The
association may adopt alternative policies of various types for future issuance
without regard to any particular impairment or insolvency.</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Alternative policies shall contain at
least the minimum statutory provisions required in this State and provide
benefits that shall not be unreasonable in relation to the premium charged. 
The association shall set the premium in accordance with a table of rates which
it shall adopt.  The premium shall reflect the amount of insurance to be
provided and the age and class of risk of each insured, but shall not reflect
any changes in the health of the insured after the original policy was last
underwritten.</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Any alternative policy issued by the
association shall provide coverage of a type similar to that of the policy
issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the association.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  If the association elects to reissue terminated
coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated
policy, the premium shall be set by the association in accordance with the
amount of insurance provided and the age and class of risk, subject to approval
of the commissioner or by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  The association's obligations with respect to
coverage under any policy of the impaired or insolvent insurer or under any
reissued or alternative policy shall cease on the date such coverage or policy
is replaced by another similar policy by the policyholder, the insured, or the
association.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  When proceeding under subsections
(b)(1)(B) or (c) with respect to any policy or contract carrying guaranteed
minimum interest rates, the association shall assure the payment or crediting
of a rate of interest consistent with section 431:16-203(b)(2)(C).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Nonpayment of premiums within thirty-one
days after the date required under the terms of any guaranteed, assumed,
alternative, or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage shall
terminate the association's obligations under such policy or coverage under
this part with respect to such policy or coverage, except with respect to any
claims incurred or any net cash surrender value which may be due in accordance
with the provisions of this part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Premiums due for coverage after entry of
an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer shall belong to and be payable
at the direction of the association, and the association shall be liable for
unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners arising after the entry of
such order.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The protection provided by this part shall
not apply where any guaranty protection is provided to residents of this State
by the laws of the domiciliary state or jurisdiction of the impaired or
insolvent insurer other than this State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  In carrying out its duties under
subsections (b) and (c), the association may, subject to approval by the court:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Impose permanent policy or contract liens in
connection with any guarantee, assumption or reinsurance agreement, if the
association finds that the amounts which can be assessed under this part are
less than the amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the
association's duties under this part, or that the economic or financial conditions
as they affect member insurers are sufficiently adverse to render the
imposition of such permanent policy or contract liens, to be in the public
interest;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Impose temporary moratoriums or liens on payments
of cash values and policy loans, or any other right to withdraw funds held in
conjunction with policies or contracts, in addition to any contractual
provisions for deferral of cash or policy loan value.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  If the association fails to act within a
reasonable period of time as provided in subsections (b)(1)(B), (c) and (d),
the commissioner shall have the powers and duties of the association under this
part with respect to impaired or insolvent insurers.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  The association may render assistance and
advice to the commissioner, upon the commissioner's request, concerning
rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage, or the performance
of other contractual obligations of any impaired or insolvent insurer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (l)  The association shall have standing to
appear before any court in this State with jurisdiction over an impaired or
insolvent insurer concerning which the association is or may become obligated
under this part.  Such standing shall extend to all matters germane to the
powers and duties of the association, including, but not limited to, proposals
for reinsuring, modifying or guaranteeing the policies or contracts of the
impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of the policies or
contracts and contractual obligations.  The association shall also have the
right to appear or intervene before a court in another state with jurisdiction
over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which the association is or may
become obligated or with jurisdiction over a third party against whom the
association may have rights through subrogation of the insurer's policyholders.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>  (m)(1)  Any person receiving benefits under this part
shall be deemed to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action
relating to, the covered policy or contract to the association to the extent of
the benefits received because of this part, whether the benefits are payments
of or on account of contractual obligations, continuation of coverage or
provision of substitute or alternative coverages.  The association may require
an assignment to it of such rights and causes of action by any payee, policy or
contract owner, beneficiary, insured, or annuitant as a condition precedent to
the receipt of any right or benefits conferred by this part upon such person.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The subrogation rights of the association under this
section shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or
insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits
under this part.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  In addition to items (1) and (2), the association
shall have all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or
legal remedy which would have been available to the impaired or insolvent
insurer or holder of a policy or contract with respect to such policy or
contracts.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (n)  The association may:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Enter into such contracts as are necessary or
proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this part;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Sue or be sued, including taking any legal
actions necessary or proper to recover any unpaid assessments under section
431:16-209 and to settle claims or potential claims against it;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Borrow money to effect the purposes of this part;
any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default
shall be legal investments for domestic insurers and may be carried as admitted
assets;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Employ or retain such persons as are<i> </i>necessary
to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform such
other functions as become necessary or proper under this part;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Take such legal action as may be necessary to
avoid payment of improper claims; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Exercise, for the purposes of this part and to
the extent approved by the commissioner, the powers of a domestic life or
accident and health or sickness insurer, but in no case may the association
issue insurance policies or annuity contracts other than those issued to
perform its obligations under this part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (o)  The association may join an organization
of one or more other state associations of similar purposes, to further the
purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association. [L 1987, c
347, pt of §2; am L 2002, c 155, §94]</p>
