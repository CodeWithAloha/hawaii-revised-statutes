<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Members of the council shall serve without
compensation, but shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses necessary for the
performance of their duties.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The administrator shall serve as liaison

forth in this article.  The council shall promptly, but in no event later than
October 15, 1998, and every October 15 thereafter, submit a report to the
governor with a copy to the board of directors, stating whether the company is
fulfilling its purpose as set forth in this article.  If the council determines

set forth in this article, it shall include in its report a detailed
description of any deficiencies.  Within a time frame established by the
council, but in no event later than six months after delivery of the council's

any deficiencies identified in the council's report.  The Hawaii employers'
mutual insurance company shall provide staff support to the council.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  If the governor determines that corrective
action is appropriate after reviewing the council's report and the company's
response, the governor shall inform the legislature, and the legislature shall
consider what action is needed. [L 1998, c 252, §2]</p>
