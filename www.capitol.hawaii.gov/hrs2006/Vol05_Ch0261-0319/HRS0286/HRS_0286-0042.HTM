<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §286-42  County finance director's duties.</b> 
(a)  The county director of finance shall examine and to the best of the
director's ability determine the genuineness and regularity of every
registration and transfer of registration of a vehicle as in this part
provided, in order that every certificate issued for a vehicle shall contain
true statements of the ownership thereof, and to prevent the registration of a
vehicle by any person not entitled thereto, and the director of finance may
require any applicant to furnish such information, in addition to that
contained in the application, as may be necessary to satisfy the director of
finance of the truth and regularity of the application.  The director of
finance may accept any county certificate of title issued for a vehicle as
prima facie evidence of ownership for registration and transfer of
registration.  The director may issue vehicle identification numbers for
reconstructed vehicles, special interest vehicles, or motorcycles, which do not
have vehicle identification numbers if the director determines that the
requirements of this section have been met.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The county director of finance may register a
motorcycle with an after market frame, using the vehicle identification number
of the frame as issued by the incomplete vehicle manufacturer of the frame.  A
bill of sale and Manufacturers Statement of Origin for the frame, engine, and
transmission must be presented and retained as a part of the permanent county
registration records.  If a Manufacturers Statement of Origin is not available
for the engine and transmission due to the use of a used or reconstructed
engine, transmission, or both, then a bill of sale or other proof of ownership,
satisfactory to the director of finance must be presented.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  For the purpose of registering standard
makes and body types of new passenger motor vehicles the director of finance
may accept the certificate of any licensed motor vehicle dealer certifying to
the weight and identification of such vehicle.  The director of finance of any
county may accept the certificate of the director of finance of any other
county as to weight and identification of any such vehicle.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The director of finance may enter into a
contract with new car dealerships and motor vehicle rental companies for the
registration of new motor vehicles consistent with any statute, ordinance, or
provision of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.  The director of
finance may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 as may be necessary for the
application, bonding, and procedural requirements of such contractor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  In the event the director of finance is
not satisfied as to the ownership of any vehicle sought to be registered,
unless the applicant presents satisfactory evidence to the director of finance
of the applicant's ownership of the vehicle and as to any liens thereon, the
director of finance may accept from the applicant a bond in such form as may be
determined by the director of finance in an amount equal to the retail value of
the vehicle.  The bond and the deposit thereof shall be conditioned to protect
the director of finance and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle or person
acquiring any lien thereon or the successor in interest of any such person
against any loss or damage on account of any defect in or undisclosed
encumbrance upon the right, title, and interest of the applicant in and to the
vehicle.  Any such interested person shall have a right of action to recover on
any such bond for any breach of the conditions for which the same was deposited. 
The aggregate liability of the surety to all such persons shall in no event
exceed the amount of the bond and interest thereon, plus a reasonable
attorney's fee to be allowed by the court incurred to procure the recovery
under the bond.  The bond shall (unless suit has been instituted thereon) be
returned and surrendered at the end of three years.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The county finance director, upon being
notified by the designated county department that a vehicle is a special
interest vehicle or that a vehicle has been inspected and approved as a
reconstructed vehicle, shall cause that fact to be shown upon the registration
and title certificates for that vehicle. [L 1929, c 197, §2; RL 1935, §2666; RL
