<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §286-51  Registration, expense.</b>  (a) 
Every certificate of registration issued under this part shall expire at
midnight on December 31 of each year and shall be renewed annually before April
1 of each year upon application by the registered owner by presentation of the
last issued certificate of registration or the last issued application for
renewal, such renewal to take effect as of January 1 of each year; provided
that the certificate of registration for each motor vehicle in the counties of
the State may be renewed on a staggered basis, if a county elects to do so. 
The director of finance of each county may adopt rules to carry out the
purposes stated in this section and shall expend the necessary funds from the
director's operating funds as may be necessary for these purposes; provided
that the director of finance, if the director has ascertained as of the date of
the application that the registered owner has not deposited or paid bail with
respect to any summons or citation issued to the registered owner for stopping,
standing, or parking in violation of traffic ordinances within the county, may
require, as a condition precedent to the renewal, that the registered owner
deposit or pay bail with respect to all such summons or citations.  The
certificates of registration issued hereunder shall show, in addition to all
information required under section 286-47, the serial number of the tag or
emblem and shall be valid during the registration year only for which they are
issued.  The certificates of ownership need not be renewed annually but shall
remain valid as to any interest shown therein until canceled by the director of
finance as provided by law or replaced by new certificates of ownership as
hereinafter provided.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  This part shall be administered by the
director of finance in conjunction with the requirements of sections 249-1 to
249-13 and shall entail no additional expense or charge to the person
registering the ownership of a motor vehicle other than as provided by this
section or by other laws; provided that for each new certificate of ownership
issued by the director of finance under section 286-52, the director of finance
may charge a fee which shall be deposited in the general fund.  The fees
charged to issue a new certificate of ownership shall be established by the
county's legislative body.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary,
an additional fee of not more than $1 for each certificate of registration for
a U-drive motor vehicle and $2 for each certificate of registration for all
other motor vehicles may be established by ordinance and collected annually by
the director of finance of each county, to be used and administered by each
county:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  For the purpose of beautification and other
related activities of highways under the ownership, control, and jurisdiction
of each county; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  To defray the additional cost in the disposition
and other related activities of abandoned or derelict vehicles as prescribed in
chapter 290.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>The $2 fee established pursuant to this subsection
for certificates of registration for motor vehicles other than U-drive motor
vehicles may be increased by ordinance up to a maximum of $5; provided that all
amounts received from any fee increase over $2 shall be expended only for the
purposes of paragraph (2).  The moneys so assessed and collected shall be
placed in a revolving fund entitled, &quot;the highway beautification and
disposal of abandoned or derelict vehicles revolving fund&quot;. [L 1929, c
