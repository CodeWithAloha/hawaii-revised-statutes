<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§281-41  Transfer of licenses; notice of
change in officers, directors, and stockholders of corporate licenses, partners
of a partnership license, and members of a limited liability company license;
penalty.</b>  (a)  No license issued under this chapter to an original
applicant or to any transferee shall be transferable or be transferred within
one year of the issuance or transfer, except for good cause shown to the
satisfaction of the liquor commission.  No license issued under this chapter
shall be transferable or be transferred except upon written application to the
commission by the proposed transferee, and after prior inspection of the
premises, reference to, and report by an inspector, and a public hearing held
by the commission not less than fourteen days after one publication of notice
thereof, but without sending notice of the hearing by mail to persons being the
owners or lessees of real estate situated within the vicinity of the premises
and without the right to the owners or lessees to protest the transfer of a
license.  Exceptions are class 5 and 11 licensees who must comply with the
notice requirements as set forth in section 281-57.  </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  No class 5 or 12 license issued to a
standard bar, as defined in section 281-1, shall be transferable to other than
a standard bar and that such license shall be subject to revocation if the
licensed premises is not retained as a standard bar except upon written
application to the commission by the licensee or the proposed transferee,
subject to sections 281-51 to 281-60.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A county may increase the requirements for
transfers of class 5, category [(1)] (B) and (D), and class 11 licenses by
ordinance designating one or more areas within the county as special liquor
districts and specifying the requirements applicable to transfers of any of
these licenses within each district.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For the purpose of this section,
&quot;special liquor district&quot; means an area designated by a county for
restoration, reservation, historic preservation, redevelopment, rejuvenation,
or residential protection, in which development is guided to protect or enhance
the physical and visual aspects of the area for the benefit of the community as
a whole.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Where a license is held by a partnership,
the commission may, notwithstanding this section, transfer the license upon the
death or withdrawal of a member of the partnership to any remaining partner or
partners without publication of notice and without public hearing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Where a license is held by a limited
partnership or a limited liability company, the admission or withdrawal of a
limited partner or a member of the limited liability company shall not be
deemed a transfer of the license held by the partnership or limited liability
company, but the licensee shall, prior to such admission or withdrawal, so
notify the commission in writing, stating the name of the partner, partners,
member, or members who have withdrawn, if such be the case, and the name, age,
and place of residence of the partner, partners, member, or members who have
been admitted, if that be the case.  If the commission finds a limited partner
or a member to be an unfit or improper person to hold a license in the limited
partner's or member's own right pursuant to section 281-45, it may revoke the
license or suspend the license of the partnership or the limited liability
company until the unfit or improper partner or member is removed or replaced.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Except as otherwise provided in this
section, the same procedure shall be followed in regard to the transfer of a
license as is prescribed by this chapter for obtaining a license.  Sections
281-51 to 281-60, except where inconsistent with any provision hereof, are
hereby made applicable to such transfers.  The word &quot;applicant&quot;, as
used in such sections, shall include each such proposed transferee, and the
words, &quot;application for a license or for the renewal of a license&quot;,
as used in such sections, shall include an application for the transfer of a
license.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Upon the hearing, the commission shall
consider the application and any objections to the granting thereof and hear
the parties in interest.  It shall inquire into the propriety of each transfer
and determine whether the proposed transferee is a fit person to hold the
license.  It may approve a transfer or refuse to approve a transfer and the
refusal by the commission to approve a transfer shall be final and conclusive,
unless an appeal is taken as provided in chapter 91.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  If any licensee without such approval
transfers to any other person the licensee's business for which the licensee's
license was issued, either openly or under any undisclosed arrangement, whereby
any person, other than the licensee, comes into possession or control of the
business or takes in any partner or associate, the commission may in its discretion
suspend or cancel the license.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  If the licensee is a corporation, a change
in ownership of any outstanding capital stock shall not be deemed a transfer of
a license; provided that in the case of a change in ownership of twenty-five
per cent or more of the stock or in the case of change in ownership of any
number of shares of the stock that results in the transferee thereof becoming
the owner of twenty-five per cent or more of the outstanding capital stock, the
corporate licensee shall, prior to the date of the transfer, apply for and
secure the approval of the transfer from the commission in writing.  If the
commission finds that the proposed transferee is an unfit or improper person to
hold a license in the proposed transferee's own right pursuant to section
281-45, it shall not approve the proposed transfer.  If any transfer is made
without the prior approval of the commission, the commission may in its
discretion revoke or suspend the license until it determines that the
transferee is a fit and proper person, and if the commission finds that the
transferee is not a fit and proper person, until a retransfer or new transfer
of the capital stock is made to a fit and proper person pursuant to section
281-45.  In addition, the corporate licensee shall, within thirty days from the
date of election of any officer or director, notify the commission in writing
of the name, age, and place of residence of the officer or director.  If the
commission finds the transferee, officer, or director an unfit or improper
person to hold a license in the transferee's, officer's, or director's own
right pursuant to section 281-45, it may in its discretion revoke the license
or suspend the license until a retransfer or new transfer of the capital stock
is effected to a fit or proper person pursuant to section 281-45 or until the
unfit or improper transferee, officer, or director is removed or replaced by a
fit and proper person pursuant to section 281-45.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  If a licensee closes out the business for
which the license is held, during the term for which the license was issued,
the licensee shall, within five days from the date of closing the same, give
the commission written notice thereof and surrender the licensee's license for
cancellation. [L Sp 1933, c 40, §23; RL 1945, §7244; am L 1949, c 301, §1(c);
