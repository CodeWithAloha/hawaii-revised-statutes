substance abuse or dependence.  All costs for assessment and treatment shall be
borne by the offender.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Notwithstanding any other law to the
contrary, whenever a court revokes a person's driver's license pursuant to this
section, the examiner of drivers shall not grant to the person a new driver's
license until the expiration of the period of revocation determined by the
court.  After the period of revocation is completed, the person may apply for

sentence imposed under subsection (b)(1).</p>

&quot;examiner of drivers&quot; has the same meaning as provided in section
286-2. [L 2000, c 189, pt of §23; am L 2001, c 157, §25; am L 2002, c 160, §11;

Constitution; retroactive application of decision to pending cases passed test
enunciated in State v. Ikezawa; Act 128 did not violate equal protection.  76 H.
360, 878 P.2d 699.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Intoxilyzer test result can be used in prosecution of
violation of subsection (a)(1) when count of violating subsection (a)(2) has
been dismissed.  77 H. 94, 881 P.2d 1240. </p>

<p class=XNotes>  Driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor is a
&quot;criminal offense&quot;, not a &quot;traffic offense&quot;, for purposes
of HRPP rule 48.  78 H. 54, 890 P.2d 291.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Both the circuit and district courts have concurrent
jurisdiction over DUI cases.  78&nbsp;H. 367, 893 P.2d 795.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Circuit court erred in its ruling on the applicability of
HRPP rule 48 to DUI cases.  78 H. 367, 893 P.2d 795.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Since ADLRO proceedings serve legitimate, nonpunitive, purely
remedial functions, defendant's subsequent criminal prosecution not barred by
double jeopardy, res judicata, and/or collateral estoppel principles. 79 H. 1,
897 P.2d 928. </p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's arguments that defendant's conviction (DUI in
violation of subsection (a)(2)) was not supported by substantial evidence and
was inconsistent with defendant's acquittal in count I (violation of subsection
(a)(1)), rejected; where defendant was charged in two counts alleging one DUI
offense, trial court did not commit plain error by instructing jury that
defendant was charged with more than one offense.  79 H. 336, 902 P.2d 971.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As §286-261(d) does not require defendant to submit to needs
assessment nor undergo any treatment for alcohol dependence, application of
that section with DUI conviction under this section not double jeopardy
violation.  80 H. 8, 904 P.2d 893.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant not subjected to multiple punishments as a result
of administrative driver's license revocation under §286-261 and DUI conviction
under this section as administrative revocation non-punitive and purely
remedial in nature.  81 H. 226, 915 P.2d 700.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Ninety-day suspension of driver's license under this section
for drunken bicyclist not unconstitutional where:  (1) no showing that
disparity of risk between drunken bicyclists and drunken automobile drivers is
so great; and (2) suspension not disproportionately onerous compared to more
serious crimes in same jurisdiction and for the same offense in different
jurisdictions.  87 H. 249, 953 P.2d 1347.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Vehicle&quot; under this section includes bicycles;
application of section to defendant bicyclist not absurd.  87 H. 249, 953 P.2d
1347.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where conviction is based solely on a chemical test, the
results of the test when taken together with its tolerance for error must equal
or exceed the statutory level.  1 H. App. 44, 613 P.2d 916.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Mandatory sentence not applicable where defendant committed
second DUI offense before being convicted of first.  5 H. App. 205, 683 P.2d
400.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant charged under section has right to jury trial; not
unconstitutionally vague.  5 H. App. 491, 704 P.2d 905, aff'd 68 H. 39, 704
P.2d 883.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant may challenge reliability of intoxilyzer test.  7
H. App. 20, 740 P.2d 1017.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Results of intoxilyzer test properly admitted.  7 H. App.
440, 777 P.2d 717.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Governmental approval of breath testing instrument and of
procedures of its use are sufficient basis for reasonable inference that
instrument measures blood alcohol concentration by weight, as required by
statute.  7 H. App. 542, 783 P.2d 1235.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Second intoxilyzer test was valid even if observation period
was less than fifteen minutes.  7 H. App. 627, 789 P.2d 1133.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  DUI conviction reversed because jury instruction required
jurors to infer a presumed fact.  7 H. App. 631, 790 P.2d 340.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Finding mens rea not required for conviction.  8 H. App. 145,
795 P.2d 285.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  DUI conviction reversed where State failed to lay proper
foundation for admission into evidence of test result obtained from
breath-testing instrument.  9 H. App. 130, 828 P.2d 813.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  DUI conviction proper where prior accuracy verification test
on intoxilyzer used showed it was operating accurately.  9 H. App. 291, 836
P.2d 506.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Substantial, probative evidence to enable a person of
reasonable caution to conclude defendant was DUI under subsection (a)(1);
nothing in statute requires alcohol be the sole or exclusive cause of a
defendant's impairment; what is required is proof beyond a reasonable doubt
that liquor contributed to the diminishment of the defendant's capacity to
drive safely.  91 H. 288, 983 P.2d 189.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As violation of this section may be proven by proof that
either the arrested driver operated a vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol or that the driver operated a vehicle while having a blood alcohol
concentration level specified or exceeding that specified in the statute,
evidence was sufficient to support finding that driver was driving under the
influence of intoxicating liquor, irrespective of admissibility of breath test
results.  96 H. 190, 29 P.3d 380.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sufficient evidence was adduced at trial to conclude that
defendant's blood alcohol content was .19 per cent--which is the equivalent of
.19 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters or cubic centimeters--and, therefore,
as a matter of law, was above the legal limit.  96 H. 320, 30 P.3d 926.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The meaning of &quot;prior alcohol enforcement contact&quot;
must be explained when advising a person arrested for driving under the
influence of intoxicating liquor, of the potential length of license revocation
for refusal to take a blood alcohol concentration test or for failing such a
test, as set forth in §286-261, in order to ensure that the refusal of, or
consent to, such a test is knowingly and intelligently made.  97 H. 463, 40
P.3d 865.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where complaint merely alleged that defendant was &quot;under
the influence of intoxicating liquor&quot; but failed to allege a critical
facet of a material element of driving under the influence offense that
defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor &quot;in an amount
sufficient to impair defendant's normal mental faculties or ability to care for
defendant and guard against casualty&quot;, it failed to state an offense and
was fatally defective; thus trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. 
101 H. 139, 63 P.3d 1109.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No reversible error in admitting intoxilyzer test result into
evidence where State laid adequate evidentiary foundation.  80 H. 102 (App.),
905 P.2d 77.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under subsection (a)(2), prosecution must establish that
result of chemical test involved, when taken together with its tolerance for
error, must equal or exceed the statutory threshold of .10 BAC to prove that
actual weight of alcohol in defendant's blood was at least 0.10 per cent.  80
H. 138 (App.), 906 P.2d 624.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where intoxilyzer measured BAC level to a thousandth of one
per cent, any error in receiving the thousandth reading in evidence was
harmless, as evidence indicated thousandth digit reading was irrelevant.  80 H.
138 (App.), 906 P.2d 624.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where evidence not presented at trial that defendant received
counsel or intelligently waived counsel at prior DUI convictions, proof for
enhanced sentencing purposes not satisfied.  81 H. 76 (App.), 912 P.2d 573.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Though trial court erred in admitting officer's testimony on
defendant's horizontal gaze nystagmus test results, error was harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt and there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant under
this section.  94 H. 388 (App.), 15 P.3d 314.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State failed to establish proper foundation for admission
under HRE rule 701 of officer's opinion that defendant failed field sobriety
tests; trial court erred in concluding defendant was DUI under subsection
(a)(1) when it relied upon officer's opinion that defendant had
&quot;failed&quot; the tests, rather than on defendant's actions or demeanor in
performing the tests.  95 H. 409 (App.), 23 P.3d 744.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Decisions under prior law (§291-4.4).</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  The term &quot;convicted&quot; in this section refers to a
prior valid DUI conviction.  100 H. 324, 60 P.3d 274.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The term &quot;conviction&quot;, as used in this section,
means any judgment or plea that has not been expunged by pardon, reversed, or
set aside at the time a defendant is found guilty of the habitual DUI charge;
it was undisputed that defendant's four prior DUI convictions had not been
expunged, reversed, or set aside at the time defendant pled guilty, and
therefore, satisfied the requirements of this section.  102 H. 219, 74 P.3d
575.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Decisions under prior law (§291-7).</b></p>

<p class=XNotes> There is no right to a jury trial under either the U.S.
Constitution or Hawaii constitution for a first-time driving under the
influence of drugs offense under §291-7 (1993) as the offense is a
&quot;petty&quot; and not &quot;serious&quot; offense.  97 H. 259, 36 P.3d 803.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Red and glassy eyes, a criminal record, and imperfect
driving, standing alone, were insufficient to establish probable cause to
arrest a person for driving under the influence of drugs; as officer did not
have probable cause to arrest defendant and did not subject defendant to
sustained and coercive questioning, Miranda warnings were not warranted when
defendant was questioned about defendant's alcohol consumption.  99 H. 370, 56
P.3d 138.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 701-109(1)(e) prohibition against conviction for more
than one offense when defendant's conduct establishes an element of more than
one offense not violated by defendant's convictions for driving under the
influence of drugs under this section and inattentive driving under §291-12 as
driving under the influence of drugs required defendant to be under the
influence of drugs and inattention to driving did not.  98 H. 188 (App.), 46
P.3d 1.</p>
