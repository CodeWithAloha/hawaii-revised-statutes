<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As Honolulu police department form 396B explains the
essential difference between the civil nature of the revocation proceeding and
the penal characteristics of the criminal proceeding, the various consequences
that flow from each, and the interrelationship between the two with respect to
driving privileges, the form satisfies the directive of subsection (a)(2) that
&quot;general information&quot; about the &quot;distinction&quot; between the
two be explained.  108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Honolulu police department form 396B need not notify drivers
that the police must establish reasonable suspicion to stop and probable cause
to believe a driver is under the influence of an intoxicant in an
administrative license revocation hearing, in the absence of a statutory
directive to that effect.  108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Decisions under prior law (§286-254).</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because notice of administrative revocation contained an
improper and erroneous statement of a defendant's rights, it was void and must
be modified to comply with requirements of §286-253.  76 H. 354, 878 P.2d 169.</p>
