<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Decisions under prior law (§286-257).</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Statute requires sworn statements, not statements given under
oath or even notarized statements.  Offender-Based Transaction
Statistics/Computerized Criminal History Arrest Report, along with arresting
officer's statement, fulfilled requirements of statute; statute does not
require the complete police report.  75 H. 1, 856 P.2d 1207.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Standard form submitted by intoxilyzer supervisor states
sufficient facts to comply with requirements of subsection (a)(2) and the
instrument is presumed to be properly functioning for thirty days after its
successful testing for accuracy; hearing officer and district court were
correct in concluding that reasonable suspicion existed for police officer to
stop appellant.  75 H. 271, 859 P.2d 917.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Based on §§286-258, 286-259, and this section, upon
petitioner's objection, the hearing officer must exclude from the record only
(a) all unsworn statements (except the arrest report) of law enforcement
officials who do not appear to testify, and (b) all other evidence that is both
irrelevant and prejudicial.  91 H. 212 (App.), 982 P.2d 346.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (b)(1)(C) does not require that all possible and
incidental effects of a refusal to consent to a chemical test be explained to
an arrestee.  91 H. 212 (App.), 982 P.2d 346.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where intoxilyzer operator's statements that breath test was
administered in compliance with operator's training and the procedures
established for conducting the test under subsection (a)(2)(B) and that
intoxilyzer indicated no errors or malfunctions during the test, statement
verified that equipment functioned in accordance with operating procedures
mandated by subsection (a)(3)(C) and set forth sufficient facts to establish
that the requirements of subsection (a)(3)(B) and (C) had been satisfied.   93
H. 133 (App.), 997 P.2d 59.</p>
