<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Of the sanctions of this part and then asked if
the person still refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, in
compliance with the requirements of section 291E-15,</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Of the sanctions of this part and then asked if
the person still refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, in

<p class=RegularParagraphs>shall be revoked for the periods specified in
subsection (d), and the respondent shall be prohibited from subsequently

operate a vehicle is administratively revoked under this part, the respondent
shall be referred to the driver's education program for an assessment, by a
certified substance abuse counselor, of the respondent's substance abuse or
dependence and the need for treatment.  The counselor shall submit a report
with recommendations to the director.  If the counselor's assessment
establishes that the extent of the respondent's substance abuse or dependence
warrants treatment, the director shall so order.  All costs for assessment and
treatment shall be paid by the respondent.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Alcohol and drug enforcement contacts that
occurred prior to January 1, 2002, shall be counted in determining the
administrative revocation period.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The requirement to provide proof of
financial responsibility pursuant to section 287-20 shall not be based upon a
revocation under subsection (b)(1). [L 2000, c 189, pt of §23; am L 2001, c
157, §21; am L 2002, c 113, §7; am L 2004, c 90, §11; am L 2006, c 64, §8 and c
201, §5]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The administrative director of the courts (director) may not,
in an administrative hearing filed pursuant to §291E-38, consider an offense
occurring after the §291E-31 notice of administrative revocation has been
issued, as a basis for increasing an administrative revocation period already
determined on administrative review by the director under §291E-37 and this
section.  108 H. 350, 120 P.3d 249.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Decisions under prior law (§286-261).</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  As section does not require defendant to submit to needs
assessment nor undergo any treatment for alcohol dependence, application of
section with DUI conviction under §291-4 not double jeopardy violation.  80 H.
8, 904 P.2d 893.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section mandates that whenever license is administratively
revoked under revocation program, offender shall be referred to certified
substance abuse counselor for assessment.  80 H. 8, 904 P.2d 893.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant not subjected to multiple punishments as a result
of administrative driver's license revocation under this section and DUI
conviction under §291-4 as administrative revocation non-punitive and purely
remedial in nature.  81 H. 226, 915 P.2d 700.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because counseling and assessment, as consequence of license
revocation under subsection (d), not punitive but purely remedial, subsequent
DUI conviction did not expose defendant to multiple &quot;punishments&quot;;
defendant's motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds thus properly denied. 
82 H. 446, 923 P.2d 388.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Director lacked discretion to impose any period of
administrative revocation upon defendant other than &quot;for life&quot; where
defendant was member of class of persons under subsection (b)(4) and written
administrative record was not deficient in any respect.  84 H. 138, 931 P.2d
580.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The inherent power of the supreme court to make orders
&quot;for the promotion of justice&quot; under §602-5(7) required that motorist
be given an opportunity to challenge the lifetime revocation of motorist's
license where one of the three predicate convictions on which revocation had
been based had been set aside; motorist was thus entitled to have district
court amend motorist's revocation period pursuant to this section upon the
presentation of proof that motorist's driving record no longer supported the
revocation period imposed.  94 H. 232, 11 P.3d 457.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The exclusionary rule in driving under the influence of
intoxicating liquor cases where defendant was misinformed of the consequences
of failing to take a chemical test applied retroactively.  96 H. 200, 29 P.3d
919.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The meaning of &quot;prior alcohol enforcement contact&quot;
must be explained when advising a person arrested for driving under the
influence of intoxicating liquor, of the potential length of license revocation
for refusal to take a blood alcohol concentration test or for failing such a
test, as set forth in this section, in order to ensure that the refusal of, or
consent to, such a test is knowingly and intelligently made.  97 H. 463, 40
P.3d 865.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Arrestees who refuse to take a test for alcohol concentration
are not subject to the administrative revocation period provided under
subsection (b)(1) and, therefore, are not eligible for conditional driver's
permits.  99 H. 70, 53 P.3d 209.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As administrative driver's license revocation office has no
discretion regarding the revocation period for someone who refuses to take a
breath or blood test, motorist was correctly informed of the consequences of
refusal to take a breath or blood test.  94 H. 348 (App.), 14 P.3d 358.</p>
