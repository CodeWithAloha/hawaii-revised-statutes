<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Honolulu police department form 396B prohibiting operation of
&quot;a vehicle&quot; in the event of license revocation did adequately put
defendant on notice that the term &quot;vehicle&quot; includes mopeds and
vessels, as the term &quot;vehicle&quot; is a term of ordinary usage and broad
enough to inform a person of ordinary intelligence that it would include a
means of ground transportation such as a moped.  108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Decisions under prior law (§286-251).</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the circumstances of the case, the absence of a
definition of &quot;prior alcohol enforcement contacts&quot; on police
department's alcohol concentration test consent form did not affect defendant's
knowing and intelligent decision to take an alcohol test.  99 H. 70, 53 P.3d
