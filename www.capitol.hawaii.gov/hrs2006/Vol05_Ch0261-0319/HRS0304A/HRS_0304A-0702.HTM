<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§304A-702]  Repayment of loans; waiver;
collection.</b>  (a)  All loans made under this subpart shall bear interest at
five per cent simple interest.  Repayment of principal and interest charges
shall commence one year after graduation or three months after a loan recipient
ceases to be enrolled in a state-approved teacher education program and shall
be paid in periodic installments within a six-year period.  The university may
charge late fees and all other reasonable costs for the collection of
delinquent loans.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Upon a showing of proof that the loan
recipient has completed a state-approved teacher education program and is
employed as a full-time teacher in the Hawaii public school system, one-tenth
of the total amount of the loan and interest shall be waived for every year of
the first five years, and the remaining balance shall be waived after the sixth
year that a loan recipient teaches in a Hawaii public school in a hard-to-fill
position as determined by the superintendent of education, including special
education, regular education shortage categories, or Title 1 schools, and in
one of the following capacities:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  As an elementary school teacher teaching in the
field of elementary education who has met standards as set forth by the Hawaii
teacher standards board; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  As a secondary school teacher teaching in the
subject area that is relevant to the loan recipient's academic major as
certified by the department of education who has met standards as set forth by
the Hawaii teacher standards board.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Liability for repayment of a loan shall be
canceled upon the death or permanent total disability of the loan recipient.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If a loan recipient subject to this
section fails to teach in the Hawaii public school system for a minimum of ten
consecutive years from the loan recipient's original date of employment with
the department of education, excluding sabbatical and other forms of temporary
leaves of absence, then the loan recipient shall repay any remaining loan
balance at the rate of ten per cent simple interest.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In accordance with chapter 103D, the
university may enter into written contracts with collection agencies for the
purpose of collecting delinquent student loans.  All payments collected,
exclusive of a collection agency's commissions, shall revert, and be credited,
to the special fund established for the Hawaii educator loan program.  A
collection agency that enters into a written contract with the university for
the collection of delinquent student loans, pursuant to this section, may
collect a commission from the debtor in accordance with the terms of, and up to
the amounts authorized in, the written contract. [L 2006, c 75, pt of §2]</p>
