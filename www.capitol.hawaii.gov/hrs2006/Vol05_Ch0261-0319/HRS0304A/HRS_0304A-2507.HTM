of the revenues and of the moneys in the reserves; and the use and disposition
of the income from the investments;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The minimum amount of revenues to be produced by
the university projects or university systems, over and above the amount
required to be produced by the first sentence and paragraphs (1) through (3) of
section [304A-2512(a)];</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The use and disposition of the proceeds of the
sale of any university project or university system, or part of either thereof;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The construction and maintenance of any

projects for the construction or maintenance of which revenue bonds are issued
or the university system or systems in which such latter project or projects
are to be included;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  The issuance of other or additional revenue bonds
payable either from the revenue of the university project or projects for the

university systems;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  The maintenance of the university project or

moneys;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  The terms and conditions upon which the holders
of bonds evidencing the obligation to repay loans, or any proportion of the
holders, or any trustee thereof, shall be entitled to the appointment of a

jurisdiction in such proceedings, and which receiver may enter and take
possession of the university project or projects, or university system or
systems, maintain them, prescribe rents, fees, and charges and collect,
receive, and apply all revenue thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner
as the board itself might do, but the receiver shall have no power, nor be
granted any power, to utilize, or permit the utilization of, any university
project or university system other than in a manner consistent with and in
furtherance of the purposes of the university;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that all such covenants shall be subject to
review by the governor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  This subpart and any resolution or
resolutions shall be a contract with the holders of bonds issued under this subpart,
and the duties of the board and any resolution or resolutions shall be
enforceable by any bondholder by mandamus or other appropriate suit, action, or
proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction. [L 2006, c 75, pt of §2]</p>
