<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§304A-2167]  University
revenue-undertakings fund.</b>  (a)  There is hereby created a special fund to
be administered by the university and shall be known as the university
revenue-undertakings fund, into which all revenue derived from a university
project or university system under subpart A of part VI shall be deposited. 
The university may deposit other revenue of the university into the fund.  At
the direction of the board, there may be established such accounts in the
university revenue-undertakings fund as required by the resolution or
resolutions authorizing revenue bonds.  In the event that revenue bonds are
issued under subpart A of part VI payable from the revenues of a university
parking unit or the revenues of a university system that includes a university
parking unit, the board in the resolution or resolutions authorizing such
revenue bonds may direct that all or any part of the moneys required by
sections [304A-2275] and [304A-2602] to be paid into the university parking
revolving fund created by section [304A-2275] shall be deposited in the
university revenue-undertakings fund in lieu of being deposited in the
university parking revolving fund, and thereafter all such moneys or such part
thereof as the board has directed shall be deposited in the university
revenue-undertakings fund in lieu of being deposited in the university parking
revolving fund.  All moneys in the university revenue-undertakings fund are
appropriated and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the
resolution or resolutions of the board authorizing the issuance of revenue
bonds under subpart A of part VI:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To provide for all costs of construction,
operation, repair, and maintenance of university projects or university
systems, including reserves therefor;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  To pay when due all revenue bonds and interest
thereon, for the payment of which the revenue is or has been pledged, charged,
or otherwise encumbered, including reserves therefor;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  To reimburse the university for all moneys
advanced to pay the expenses incurred in making the preparation for the initial
issuance of revenue bonds under subpart A of part VI;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  To reimburse the general fund of the State for
all bond requirements for general obligation bonds that are or shall have been
issued for a university project or university system, or to refund any of those
general obligation bonds, except insofar as the obligation of reimbursement has
been or shall be canceled by the legislature, the bond requirements being the
interest on term and serial bonds, sinking fund for term bonds, and principal
of serial bonds maturing the following year;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  To provide a reserve for betterments and
improvements to, and renewals and replacements of, university projects or
university systems.  If adequate provision has been made for all the foregoing
purposes, and if permitted by the covenants in the resolution or resolutions
authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds under subpart A of part VI, any
surplus moneys remaining in the university revenue-undertakings fund at the end
of any fiscal year may be expended by the board in subsequent years in
furtherance of any or all of the purposes of the university.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The following terms used in this section
shall be as defined in section [304A-2501]:  &quot;board&quot;, &quot;cost of
construction&quot;, &quot;maintenance&quot;, &quot;reserves&quot;,
&quot;revenue bonds&quot;, &quot;revenue of the university project or
university system&quot;, &quot;university&quot;, &quot;university parking
unit&quot;, &quot;university project&quot;, and &quot;university system&quot;.
