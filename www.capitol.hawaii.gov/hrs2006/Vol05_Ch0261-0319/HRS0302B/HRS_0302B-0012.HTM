<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§302B-12  Funding and finance.  </b>(a) 
Beginning with fiscal year 2006-2007, and each fiscal year thereafter, the
office shall submit a request for general fund appropriations for each charter
school based upon:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The actual and projected enrollment figures in
the current school year for each charter school; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A per-pupil amount for each regular education and
special education student, which shall be equivalent to the total per-pupil
cost based upon average enrollment in all regular education cost categories,
including comprehensive school support services but excluding special education
services, and for all means of financing except federal funds, as reported in
the most recently published department consolidated annual financial report;
provided that the legislature may make an adjustment to the per-pupil
allocation for the purposes of this section; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Those fringe benefit costs requested shall be
included in the department of budget and finance's annual budget request.  No
fringe benefit costs shall be charged directly to or deducted from the charter
school per-pupil allocations unless they are already included in the funds
distributed to the charter school.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature shall make an appropriation
based upon the budget request; provided that the legislature may make
additional appropriations for fringe, workers' compensation, and other employee
benefits, facility costs, and other requested amounts.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The governor, pursuant to chapter 37, may
impose restrictions or reductions on charter school appropriations similar to
those imposed on other public schools.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Charter schools shall be eligible for all
federal financial support to the same extent as all other public schools.  The
department shall provide the office with all federal grant proposals that
include charter schools as potential recipients and timely reports on federal
grants received for which charter schools may apply.  Federal funds received by
the department for charter schools shall be transferred to the office for
distribution to charter schools in accordance with the federal requirements. 
If administrative services related to federal grants and subsidies are provided
to the charter school by the department, the charter school shall reimburse the
department for the actual costs of the administrative services in an amount
that shall not exceed six and one-half per cent of the charter school's federal
grants and subsidies.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Any charter school shall be eligible to receive
any supplemental federal grant or award for which any other public school may
submit a proposal, or any supplemental federal grants limited to charter
schools; provided that if department administrative services, including funds
management, budgetary, fiscal accounting, or other related services, are
provided with respect to these supplemental grants, the charter school shall
reimburse the department for the actual costs of the administrative services in
an amount that shall not exceed six and one-half per cent of the supplemental
grant for which the services are used.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     All additional funds generated by the local
school boards, that are not from a supplemental grant, shall be held separate
from allotted funds and may be expended at the discretion of the local school
boards.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  To enable charter schools to access state
funding prior to the start of each school year, foster their fiscal planning,
and enhance their accountability, the office shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Provide fifty per cent of a charter school's
per-pupil allocation based on the charter school's projected student enrollment
no later than July 20 of each fiscal year; provided that the charter school
shall submit to the office a projected student enrollment no later than May 15
of each year;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Provide an additional forty per cent of a charter
school's per-pupil allocation no later than November 15 of each year; provided
that the charter school shall submit to the office:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Student enrollment as verified on October
15 of each year; provided that the student enrollment shall be verified on the
last business day immediately prior to October 15 should that date fall on a
weekend; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  An accounting of the percentage of student
enrollment that transferred from public schools established and maintained by
the department; provided that these accountings shall also be submitted by the
office to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the start of each
regular session; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The remaining ten per cent per-pupil allocation
of a charter school no later than January 1 of each year as a contingency
balance to ensure fiscal accountability;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that the board may make adjustments in
allocations based on noncompliance with office administrative procedures and
board-approved accountability requirements. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The department shall provide appropriate
transitional resources to a conversion charter school for its first year of
operation as a charter school based upon the department's allocation to the
school for the year prior to the conversion.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  No start-up charter school or conversion
charter school may assess tuition. [L 2006, c 298, pt of §2]</p>
