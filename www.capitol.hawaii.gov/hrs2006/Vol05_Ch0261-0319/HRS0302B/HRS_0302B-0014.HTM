<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  A profile of the charter school's enrollment and

viability.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The board shall conduct multi-year

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The board may conduct special evaluations
of charter schools at any time.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The board may place a charter school on

an evaluation of the charter school and makes recommendations to the board;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The board and the office are involved in
substantive discussions with the charter school regarding the areas of
deficiencies;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The notice of probation is delivered to the

probation period, and monitoring and reporting requirements;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  For deficiencies related to student performance,
a charter school shall be allowed two years to improve student performance; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  For deficiencies related to financial plans, a
charter school shall be allowed one year to develop a sound financial plan.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The charter school shall remain on probationary
status until the board votes to either remove the charter school from
probationary status or revoke its charter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  If a charter school fails to resolve
deficiencies by the end of the probation period, the board may revoke the
charter; provided that the vote of two-thirds of all the members to which the
board is entitled shall be required to revoke the charter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The board may place a charter school on
probationary status or revoke the charter for serious student or employee
health or safety deficiencies; provided that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The charter school is given notice of specific
health or safety deficiencies and is afforded an opportunity to present its
case to the board;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The board chair appoints a task group, which may
be an investigative task group, the panel, or the office, to visit the charter
school and conduct meetings with its local school board and its school
community to gather input;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Based on its findings, the task group shall
recommend to the board to revoke the charter, place the charter school on
probation, or continue the charter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The vote of two-thirds of all the members to
which the board is entitled shall be required to revoke the charter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The best interest of the school's students guide
all decisions; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  After a decision to revoke a charter, the charter
school shall be allowed to remain open until a plan for an orderly shutdown or
transfer of students and assets is developed and executed, or until the school
year ends, whichever comes first.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  If there is an immediate concern for
student or employee health or safety at a charter school, the board, in
consultation with the office, may adopt an interim restructuring plan that may
include the appointment of an interim local school board, an interim local
school board chairperson, or a principal to temporarily assume operations of
the school; provided that if possible without further jeopardizing the health
or safety of students and employees, the charter school's stakeholders and
community are first given the opportunity to elect a new local school board
which shall appoint a new interim principal.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The board shall adopt rules pursuant to
chapter 91 for placing charter schools on probation and for revoking a charter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  If, at any time, a charter school
dissolves or the charter is revoked, the State shall have first right, at no
cost to the State, to all the assets and facilities of the charter school,
except as otherwise provided by law. [L 2006, c 298, pt of §2]</p>
