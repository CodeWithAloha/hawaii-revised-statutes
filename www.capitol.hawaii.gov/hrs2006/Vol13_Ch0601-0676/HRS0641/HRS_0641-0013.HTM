<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appeal, see Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure.  See also
appended chapter note, pt. I A.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Oral ruling of district magistrate constitutes an order
within the meaning of this section.  41 H. 591.  But appeal by State from oral
order of circuit court dismissing indictment is nugatory.  45 H. 501, 370 P.2d
480.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Special plea in bar, sustaining of, what constitutes.  25 H.
55; 47 H. 361, 389 P.2d 439.  See 39 H. 522.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No appeal by State from ruling on question of law unless

jury.  42 H. 102.</p>

409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under prior law sustaining of demurrer to indictment not
appealable unless based on construction of statute or its invalidity.  21 H.
56, 57; 23 H. 546; 29 H. 827.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Pretrial order to suppress evidence; &quot;special plea in
bar&quot; construed.  50 H. 525, 445 P.2d 36.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When State appeals from the quashing of an indictment,
defendant is still subject to original requirements of bail.  53 H. 76, 488
P.2d 329.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Cited:  37 H. 601, 603; 48 H. 247, 256, 397 P.2d 575.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Rules of Court</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appeals, when taken, see HRAP rule 4.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Conditional discharge of defendant under section 712-1255 is
not a final disposition of the case appealable by the State.  60 H. 576, 592
P.2d 832.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Stipulation for joint hearing on motion to suppress and trial
on merits is not a waiver by State of its right to appeal from ruling on motion
to suppress.  62 H. 44, 609 P.2d 131.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under circumstances, jeopardy did not attach even though jury
was sworn.  64 H. 395, 641 P.2d 1338.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Jeopardy did not attach where case dismissed after defendant
arraigned but before State's first witness sworn.  68 H. 238, 709 P.2d 607.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State could appeal only under paragraph (2) where case
dismissed after all evidence taken.  68 H. 653, 729 P.2d 385.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Deferred acceptance of guilty and deferred acceptance of no
contest pleas are not appealable.  69 H. 438, 746 P.2d 568.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Authorizes appellate jurisdiction to review orders granting
pretrial motions to suppress.  70 H. 206, 767 P.2d 1238.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Language does not allow an appeal from a sentence on the
ground that the sentence was imposed in an illegal manner, but allows an appeal
from an illegal sentence.  71 H. 624, 801 P.2d 558.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State's right to appeal in criminal cases is limited to instances
stated in section; section does not give State right to appeal from granting of
deferred acceptance of guilty or deferred acceptance of no contest pleas.  74
H. 75, 837 P.2d 776.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  While it is necessary for &quot;entire case&quot; to be
dismissed for paragraph (2) to apply, there is nothing in the language of this
section to indicate that this would prevent paragraph (1) from applying;
prosecution not barred from bringing appeal of dismissal of counts of
indictment, where counts dismissed after trial began because counts did not
include essential elements of offenses charged.  78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In a jury trial, issues decided by the judge are
&quot;questions of law&quot; appealable under this section, while issues
decided by the jury are &quot;questions of fact&quot; and are not appealable. 
85 H. 462, 946 P.2d 32.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As defendant's &quot;motion to dismiss&quot; following a jury
verdict of guilty deemed post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal
following a jury verdict of guilty pursuant to HRPP rule 29(c), paragraph (9)
authorized prosecution to assert appeal from this judgment of acquittal; thus,
supreme court had appellate jurisdiction over appeal.  87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Double jeopardy clauses not violated by prosecution's appeal
from judgment of acquittal following jury's verdict of guilty pursuant to
paragraph (9).  87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Paragraph (1) permits prosecution to appeal from both
dismissals with prejudice and without prejudice.  87 H. 260, 953 P.2d 1358.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where trial court's order was an order of dismissal and not a
judgment of acquittal, order was appealable under paragraph (1).  97 H. 505, 40
P.3d 907.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Paragraph (7) authorizes the prosecution to appeal orders
suppressing evidence as illegally obtained, the intent of the statute being to
facilitate the administration of justice in criminal cases by allowing the
prosecution to obtain a conclusive ruling on issues involving searches,
seizures, and confessions via direct appeal.  104 H. 224, 87 P.3d 893.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The language of paragraph (7), which allows the prosecution
to appeal from &quot;a pretrial order granting a motion for the suppression of
evidence,&quot; includes within its scope the right to appeal from a trial
court’s voluntariness determination mandated by §621-26.  104 H. 224, 87 P.3d
893.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As district family court proceedings under §571-11(1)
concerning juvenile law violators are considered to be noncriminal proceedings,
prosecution's appeal of family court order was not authorized by paragraph
(7).  104 H. 403, 91 P.3d 485.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Deferred acceptance of no contest plea not appealable until
no contest plea accepted.  5 H. App. 357, 692 P.2d 1171.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section is to be strictly construed.  7 H. App. 516, 782 P.2d
29.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Paragraph (9) did not preclude appellate court's jurisdiction
over State's appeal where trial court's judgment of acquittal was &quot;in form
only and not in substance&quot;; trial court made no factual determination as
to some or all of the elements charged, but grounded its ruling on the
conclusion that the charges were defective as a matter of law.  88 H. 477 (App.),
967 P.2d 674.</p>
