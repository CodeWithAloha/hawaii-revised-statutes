<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§485-15  Denial, revocation, or suspension
of dealers', investment advisers', salespersons', and investment adviser
representatives' registration; suspension during investigation, etc.</b>  Upon
the finding of errors in a registration statement or the filing of complaints
by consumers or by any government agency, the commissioner may conduct an
investigation of the applicant or registrant and the commissioner may deny an
application for registration, revoke or suspend any registration, or limit or
impose conditions on the securities activities that a registrant may conduct in
this State, if after reasonable notice and a hearing the commissioner
determines that the applicant or registrant:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Has filed an application for registration which
as of its effective date, or as of any date after filing in the case of an
order denying effectiveness, was incomplete in any material respect or
contained any statement which was, in light of the circumstances under which it
was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Has violated or failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Has been convicted, within the past ten years, of
any misdemeanor involving a security or any aspect of the securities business,
or any felony;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Is permanently or temporarily enjoined by any
court of competent jurisdiction for engaging in or continuing any conduct or
practice involving any aspect of the securities business;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Is the subject of an order of the commissioner
denying, suspending, or revoking registration as a dealer, investment adviser,
salesperson, or investment adviser representative;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Is the subject of an order entered within the
past five years by the securities administrator of any other state or by the
Securities and Exchange Commission denying or revoking registration as a
dealer, investment adviser, salesperson, or investment adviser representative,
or the substantial equivalent of those terms as defined in this chapter, or is
the subject of an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission suspending or
expelling the applicant or registrant from a national securities exchange or
national securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, or is the subject of a United States Post Office fraud order; but:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  The commissioner may not institute a
revocation or suspension proceeding under this paragraph more than one year
from the date of the order relied on; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The commissioner may not enter an order
under this paragraph on the basis of an order under another law of this State
unless that order was based on facts which would currently constitute a ground
for an order under this section;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Has engaged or is about to engage in fraudulent,
dishonest, or unethical practices in the securities business;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Is insolvent, either in the sense that
liabilities exceed assets or in the sense that the dealer, investment adviser,
salesperson, or investment adviser representative cannot meet obligations as
they mature; but the commissioner may not enter an order against a dealer or
investment adviser under this paragraph without a finding of insolvency as to
the dealer or investment adviser;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  Is not qualified on the basis of such factors as
training, experience, and knowledge of the securities business;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  Has failed reasonably to supervise agents, if a
dealer or an agent of a dealer with supervisory responsibilities, or employees,
if an investment adviser or an employee of an investment adviser with
supervisory responsibilities; for the purposes of this paragraph no person
shall be deemed to have failed reasonably to supervise any person if there have
been established procedures, and a system for applying such procedures, which
would reasonably be expected to prevent and detect, insofar as practicable, any
such violations by such other person, and such person has reasonably discharged
the duties and obligations incumbent upon the person by reason of such
procedures and system without reasonable cause to believe that such procedures
and system were not being complied with; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  Has demonstrated unworthiness to transact the
business of dealer, investment adviser, salesperson, or investment adviser
representative.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In cases of charges against a salesperson or
investment adviser representative notice thereof shall also be given the dealer
or investment adviser employing such salesperson or investment adviser
representative.  Pending the hearing, the commissioner may order the suspension
of the dealer's, investment adviser's, salesperson's, or investment adviser
representative's registration; provided the order states the cause for the
suspension.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Until the entry of a final order the suspension
of the dealer's or investment adviser's registration, though binding upon the
persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be
published, unless it appears that the order of suspension has been violated
after notice.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In the event the commissioner determines to
refuse or revoke a registration as provided in this section, the commissioner
shall enter a final order with the commissioner's findings on the register of
dealers, investment advisers, salespersons, and investment adviser
representatives; and suspension or revocation of the registration of a dealer
or investment adviser shall also suspend or revoke the registration of all the
dealer's or investment adviser's salespersons or investment adviser
representatives.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     It shall be sufficient cause for refusal or
cancellation of registration in case of a partnership or corporation or any
unincorporated association, if any member of a partnership or any officer or
director of the corporation or association has been guilty of any act or
omission which would be cause for refusing or revoking the registration of an
individual dealer, investment adviser, salesperson, or investment adviser
representative. [L 1957, c 314, pt of §1; Supp, §199-12; HRS §485-15; am L
