<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  To engage in any act, practice, or course of

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  It is unlawful for any investment adviser
to enter into, extend, or renew any investment advisory contract unless it
provides in writing:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Except as provided in subsection (d), that the
investment adviser shall not be compensated on the basis of a share of capital
gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of
the client;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  That no assignment of the contract may be made by
the investment adviser without the consent of the other party to the contract;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  That the investment adviser, if a partnership,

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  The investment adviser is acting as

security to or purchases any security from a client for whom the investment
adviser is acting as investment adviser; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The investment adviser is acting as broker
for a person other than the client and knowingly effects any sale or purchase
of securities, real estate, insurance contracts, annuities contracts, or any
types of real or personal property for the account of the client; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  That the investment adviser and investment
adviser representative shall provide the disclosure statement described in
subsection (c)(4) and obtain the written consent of the client to the
transactions described in the disclosure statement prior to the closing of the
transactions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Subsection (c)(1) does not prohibit an
investment advisory contract that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Provides for compensation based upon the total
value of a fund averaged over a definite period, or as of definite dates or
taken as of a definite date; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Provides for compensation to the investment

subsection (c)(2), includes any direct or indirect transfer or hypothecation of
an investment advisory contract by the assignor or of a controlling block of
the assignor's outstanding voting securities by a security holder of the
assignor; but, if the investment adviser is a partnership, no assignment of an
investment advisory contract is considered to result from the death or
withdrawal of a minority of the members of the investment adviser having only a
minority interest in the business of the investment adviser, or from the
admission to the investment adviser of one or more members who, after
admission, will be only a minority of the members and will have only a minority
interest in the business.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  It is unlawful for any investment adviser
