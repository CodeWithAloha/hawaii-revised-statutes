federal administrative enforcement order or judgment entered within the last
five years, finding fraud or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of
any security; or</p>

<p class=iClause>             (iv)  Is currently subject to any order,

<p class=iClause>              (i)  The party subject to the disqualification
is licensed or registered to conduct securities-related business in the state

&quot;accredited investor&quot; shall have the same meaning as provided in 17
Code of Federal Regulations section 230.501(a);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (17)  Any offer or sale of a security effected by a
resident of Canada who is excluded from the definition of &quot;dealer&quot;
under section 485-1(3)(E);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (18)  Any transaction that is exempt or would be exempt

230.508 under the Securities Act of 1933; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (20)  Any transaction that the commissioner may exempt,
conditionally or unconditionally, by rules adopted in accordance with chapter
91 that:</p>
