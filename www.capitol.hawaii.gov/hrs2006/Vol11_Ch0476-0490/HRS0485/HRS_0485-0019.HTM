exempted under section 485-4, and including any transaction exempted under
section 485-6, any person, as defined in this chapter:</p>

attempts to make in the State fictitious or pretended purchases or sales of
securities;</p>

in any practice or transaction or course of business relating to the purchase
or sale of securities (A) which is in violation of law, (B) or which is

<p class=RegularParagraphs>the commissioner may investigate and whenever the

such person has engaged in, is engaged, or is about to engage in any of the
practices or transactions hereinbefore referred to as and declared to be
fraudulent practices; or is selling or offering for sale any securities in
violation of this chapter or is acting as a dealer, investment adviser,

about to participate in such fraudulent practices or acting in violation of
this chapter, to enjoin such person and such other person or persons from

acts in furtherance thereof or in violation of this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In any such court proceedings the commissioner
may apply for and on due showing be entitled to have issued the court's

defendant's employees, salespersons, or agents and the production of documents,
books, and records as may appear necessary for the hearing of such petition to
testify and give evidence concerning the acts or conduct or things complained
