<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-315  Implied warranty:  fitness for
particular purpose.</b>  Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason
to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the
buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish
suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an
implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose. [L 1965, c 208,
§2-315; HRS §490:2-315]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 15 (1), (4), (5), Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Whether or not this warranty arises in any individual
case is basically a question of fact to be determined by the circumstances of
the contracting.  Under this section the buyer need not bring home to the
seller actual knowledge of the particular purpose for which the goods are
intended or of his reliance on the seller's skill and judgment, if the
circumstances are such that the seller has reason to realize the purpose
intended or that the reliance exists.  The buyer, of course, must actually be
relying on the seller.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  A &quot;particular purpose&quot; differs from the
ordinary purpose for which the goods are used in that it envisages a specific
use by the buyer which is peculiar to the nature of his business whereas the
ordinary purposes for which goods are used are those envisaged in the concept
of merchantability and go to uses which are customarily made of the goods in
question.  For example, shoes are generally used for the purpose of walking
upon ordinary ground, but a seller may know that a particular pair was selected
to be used for climbing mountains.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A contract may of course include both a warranty of
merchantability and one of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The provisions of this Article on the cumulation and conflict
of express and implied warranties must be considered on the question of
inconsistency between or among warranties.  In such a case any question of fact
as to which warranty was intended by the parties to apply must be resolved in
favor of the warranty of fitness for particular purpose as against all other
warranties except where the buyer has taken upon himself the responsibility of
furnishing the technical specifications.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  In connection with the warranty of fitness for a
particular purpose the provisions of this Article on the allocation or division
of risks are particularly applicable in any transaction in which the purpose
for which the goods are to be used combines requirements both as to the quality
of the goods themselves and compliance with certain laws or regulations.  How
the risks are divided is a question of fact to be determined, where not
expressly contained in the agreement, from the circumstances of contracting,
usage of trade, course of performance and the like, matters which may
constitute the &quot;otherwise agreement&quot; of the parties by which they may
divide the risk or burden.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  The absence from this section of the language used in the
Uniform Sales Act in referring to the seller, &quot;whether he be the grower or
manufacturer or not,&quot; is not intended to impose any requirement that the
seller be a grower or manufacturer.  Although normally the warranty will arise
only where the seller is a merchant with the appropriate &quot;skill or
judgment,&quot; it can arise as to non-merchants where this is justified by the
particular circumstances.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  The elimination of the &quot;patent or other trade
name&quot; exception constitutes the major extension of the warranty of fitness
which has been made by the cases and continued in this Article.  Under the
present section the existence of a patent or other trade name and the
designation of the article by that name, or indeed in any other definite
manner, is only one of the facts to be considered on the question of whether
the buyer actually relied on the seller, but it is not of itself decisive of
the issue.  If the buyer himself is insisting on a particular brand he is not
relying on the seller's skill and judgment and so no warranty results.  But the
mere fact that the article purchased has a particular patent or trade name is
not sufficient to indicate nonreliance if the article has been recommended by
the seller as adequate for the buyer's purposes.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  The specific reference forward in the present section to
the following section on exclusion or modification of warranties is to call
attention to the possibility of eliminating the warranty in any given case. 
However it must be noted that under the following section the warranty of
fitness for a particular purpose must be excluded or modified by a conspicuous
writing.</p>
