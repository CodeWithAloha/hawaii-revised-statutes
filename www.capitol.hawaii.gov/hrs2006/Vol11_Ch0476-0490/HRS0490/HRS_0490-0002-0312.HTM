<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-312</b>  Warranty of title and
against infringement; buyer's obligation against infringement.  (1)  Subject to
subsection (2) there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the seller that</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   The title conveyed shall be good, and its
transfer rightful; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   The goods shall be delivered free from any
security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time
of contracting has no knowledge.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  A warranty under subsection (1) will be
excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give
the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in
himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a
third person may have.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a
merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall
be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of
infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller
must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of
compliance with the specifications. [L 1965, c 208, §2-312; HRS §490:2-312]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b> </b> <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 13, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Completely rewritten, the provisions
concerning infringement being new.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Subsection (1) makes provision for a buyer's basic needs
in respect to a title which he in good faith expects to acquire by his
purchase, namely, that he receive a good, clean title transferred to him also
in a rightful manner so that he will not be exposed to a lawsuit in order to
protect it.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The warranty extends to a buyer whether or not the seller was
in possession of the goods at the time the sale or contract to sell was made.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The warranty of quiet possession is abolished.  Disturbance
of quiet possession, although not mentioned specifically, is one way, among
many, in which the breach of the warranty of title may be established.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The &quot;knowledge&quot; referred to in subsection 1(b) is
actual knowledge as distinct from notice.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The provisions of this Article requiring notification to
the seller within a reasonable time after the buyer's discovery of a breach
apply to notice of a breach of the warranty of title, where the seller's breach
was innocent.  However, if the seller's breach was in bad faith he cannot be
permitted to claim that he has been misled or prejudiced by the delay in giving
notice.  In such case the &quot;reasonable&quot; time for notice should receive
a very liberal interpretation.  Whether the breach by the seller is in good or
bad faith Section 2-725 provides that the cause of action accrues when the
breach occurs.  Under the provisions of that section the breach of the warranty
of good title occurs when tender of delivery is made since the warranty is not
one which extends to &quot;future performance of the goods.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  When the goods are part of the seller's normal stock and
are sold in his normal course of business, it is his duty to see that no claim
of infringement of a patent or trademark by a third party will mar the buyer's
title.  A sale by a person other than a dealer, however, raises no implication
in its circumstances of such a warranty.  Nor is there such an implication when
the buyer orders goods to be assembled, prepared or manufactured on his own
specifications.  If, in such a case, the resulting product infringes a patent
or trademark, the liability will run from buyer to seller.  There is, under
such circumstances, a tacit representation on the part of the buyer that the
seller will be safe in manufacturing according to the specifications, and the
buyer is under an obligation in good faith to indemnify him for any loss
suffered.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  This section rejects the cases which recognize the
principle that infringements violate the warranty of title but deny the buyer a
remedy unless he has been expressly prevented from using the goods.  Under this
Article &quot;eviction&quot; is not a necessary condition to the buyer's remedy
since the buyer's remedy arises immediately upon receipt of notice of
infringement; it is merely one way of establishing the fact of breach.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Subsection (2) recognizes that sales by sheriffs,
executors, foreclosing lienors and persons similarly situated are so out of the
ordinary commercial course that their peculiar character is immediately
apparent to the buyer and therefore no personal obligation is imposed upon the
seller who is purporting to sell only an unknown or limited right.  This
subsection does not touch upon and leaves open all questions of restitution
arising in such cases, when a unique article so sold is reclaimed by a third
party as the rightful owner.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  The warranty of subsection (1) is not designated as an
&quot;implied&quot; warranty, and hence is not subject to Section 2-316(3). 
Disclaimer of the warranty of title is governed instead by subsection (2),
which requires either specific language or the described circumstances.</p>
