<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-206  Offer and acceptance in
formation of contract.</b>  (1)  Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by
the language or circumstances</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   An offer to make a contract shall be construed as
inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the
circumstances;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   An order or other offer to buy goods for prompt
or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a
prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or
nonconforming goods, but such a shipment of nonconforming goods does not
constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the
shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Where the beginning of a requested
performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified
of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed
before acceptance. [L 1965, c 208, §2-206; HRS §490:2-206]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b> </b> <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes> <b> Changes:</b>  Completely rewritten in this and other
sections of this Article.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  To make it clear
that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Any reasonable manner of acceptance is intended to be
regarded as available unless the offeror has made quite clear that it will not
be acceptable.  Former technical rules as to acceptance, such as requiring that
telegraphic offers be accepted by telegraphed acceptance, etc., are rejected
and a criterion that the acceptance be &quot;in any manner and by any medium
reasonable under the circumstances,&quot; is substituted.  This section is
intended to remain flexible and its applicability to be enlarged as new media
of communication develop or as the more time-saving present day media come into
general use.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Either shipment or a prompt promise to ship is made a
proper means of acceptance of an offer looking to current shipment.  In
accordance with ordinary commercial understanding the section interprets an
order looking to current shipment as allowing acceptance either by actual
shipment or by a prompt promise to ship and rejects the artificial theory that
only a single mode of acceptance is normally envisaged by an offer.  This is
true even though the language of the offer happens to be &quot;ship at once&quot;
or the like.  &quot;Shipment&quot; is here used in the same sense as in Section
2-504; it does not include the beginning of delivery by the seller's own truck
or by messenger.  But loading on the seller's own truck might be a beginning of
performance under subsection (2).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The beginning of performance by an offeree can be
effective as acceptance so as to bind the offeror only if followed within a
reasonable time by notice to the offeror.  Such a beginning of performance must
unambiguously express the offeree's intention to engage himself.  For the
protection of both parties it is essential that notice follow in due course to
constitute acceptance.  Nothing in this section however bars the possibility
that under the common law performance begun may have an intermediate effect of
temporarily barring revocation of the offer, or at the offeror's option, final
effect in constituting acceptance.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Subsection (1) (b) deals with the situation where a
shipment made following an order is shown by a notification of shipment to be referable
to that order but has a defect.  Such a non-conforming shipment is normally to
be understood as intended to close the bargain, even though it proves to have
been at the same time a breach.  However, the seller by stating that the
shipment is non-conforming and is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer
keeps the shipment or notification from operating as an acceptance.</p>
