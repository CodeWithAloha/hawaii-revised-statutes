<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>PART 5. 
PERFORMANCE</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-501  Insurable interest in goods;
manner of identification of goods.</b>  (1)  The buyer obtains a special
property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods
as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are
nonconforming and he has an option to return or reject them.  Such
identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to
by the parties.  In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>When the contract is made if it is for the sale of
goods already existing and identified;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>If the contract is for the sale of future goods
other than those described in paragraph (c), when the goods are shipped, marked
or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>When the crops are planted or otherwise become
growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of
unborn young to be born within twelve months after contracting or for the sale
of crops to be harvested within twelve months or the next normal harvest season
after contracting whichever is longer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  The seller retains an insurable interest
in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in
him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or
insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final
substitute other goods for those identified.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Nothing in this section impairs any
insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law. [L 1965,
c 208, §2-501; HRS §490:2-501]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  See Sections 17
and 19, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The present section deals with the manner of identifying
goods to the contract so that an insurable interest in the buyer and the rights
set forth in the next section will accrue.  Generally speaking, identification
may be made in any manner &quot;explicitly agreed to&quot; by the parties.  The
rules of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) apply only in the absence of such
&quot;explicit agreement&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  In the ordinary case identification of particular
existing goods as goods to which the contract refers is unambiguous and may
occur in one of many ways.  It is possible, however, for the identification to
be tentative or contingent.  In view of the limited effect given to
identification by this Article, the general policy is to resolve all doubts in
favor of identification.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The provision of this section as to &quot;explicit
agreement&quot; clarifies the present confusion in the law of sales which has
arisen from the fact that under prior uniform legislation all rules of
presumption with reference to the passing of title or to appropriation (which
in turn depended upon identification) were regarded as subject to the contrary
intention of the parties or of the party appropriating.  Such uncertainty is
reduced to a minimum under this section by requiring &quot;explicit
agreement&quot; of the parties before the rules of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
are displaced - as they would be by a term giving the buyer power to select the
goods.  An &quot;explicit&quot; agreement, however, need not necessarily be
found in the terms used in the particular transaction.  Thus, where a usage of
the trade has previously been made explicit by reduction to a standard set of
&quot;rules and regulations&quot; currently incorporated by reference into the
contracts of the parties, a relevant provision of those &quot;rules and
regulations&quot; is &quot;explicit&quot; within the meaning of this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  In view of the limited function of identification there
is no requirement in this section that the goods be in deliverable state or
that all of the seller's duties with respect to the processing of the goods be
completed in order that identification occur.  For example, despite
identification the risk of loss remains on the seller under the risk of loss
provisions until completion of his duties as to the goods and all of his
remedies remain dependent upon his not defaulting under the contract.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Undivided shares in an identified fungible bulk, such as
grain in an elevator or oil in a storage tank, can be sold.  The mere making of
the contract with reference to an undivided share in an identified fungible
bulk is enough under subsection (a) to effect an identification if there is no
explicit agreement otherwise.  The seller's duty, however, to segregate and
deliver according to the contract is not affected by such an identification but
is controlled by other provisions of this Article.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Identification of crops under paragraph (c) is made upon
planting only if they are to be harvested within the year or within the next
normal harvest season.  The phrase &quot;next normal harvest season&quot;
fairly includes nursery stock raised for normally quick &quot;harvest,&quot; but
plainly excludes a &quot;timber&quot; crop to which the concept of a harvest
&quot;season&quot; is inapplicable.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Paragraph (c) is also applicable to a crop of wool or the
young of animals to be born within twelve months after contracting.  The
product of a lumbering, mining or fishing operation, though seasonal, is not
within the concept of &quot;growing&quot;.  Identification under a contract for
all or part of the output of such an operation can be effected early in the
operation.</p>
