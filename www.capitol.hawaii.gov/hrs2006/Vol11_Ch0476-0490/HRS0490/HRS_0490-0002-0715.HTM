<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-715  Buyer's incidental and
consequential damages.</b>  (1)  Incidental damages resulting from the seller's
breach include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt,
transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected, any commercially
reasonable charges, expenses or commission in connection with effecting cover
and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Consequential damages resulting from the
seller's breach include</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Any loss resulting from general or particular
requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had
reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or
otherwise; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Injury to person or property proximately
resulting from any breach of warranty. [L 1965, c 208, §2-715; HRS §490:2-715]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Subsection (2)(b) - Sections 69(7) and 70, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b>
<b>Matter:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Subsection (1) is intended to provide reimbursement for
the buyer who incurs reasonable expenses in connection with the handling of
rightfully rejected goods or goods whose acceptance may be justifiably revoked,
or in connection with effecting cover where the breach of the contract lies in
non-conformity or non- delivery of the goods.  The incidental damages listed
are not intended to be exhaustive but are merely illustrative of the typical
kinds of incidental damage.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Subsection (2) operates to allow the buyer, in an
appropriate case, any consequential damages which are the result of the
seller's breach.  The &quot;tacit agreement&quot; test for the recovery of
consequential damages is rejected.  Although the older rule at common law which
made the seller liable for all consequential damages of which he had
&quot;reason to know&quot; in advance is followed, the liberality of that rule
is modified by refusing to permit recovery unless the buyer could not
reasonably have prevented the loss by cover or otherwise.  Subparagraph (2) carries
forward the provisions of the prior uniform statutory provision as to
consequential damages resulting from breach of warranty, but modifies the rule
by requiring first that the buyer attempt to minimize his damages in good
faith, either by cover or otherwise.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  In the absence of excuse under the section on merchant's
excuse by failure of presupposed conditions, the seller is liable for
consequential damages in all cases where he had reason to know of the buyer's
general or particular requirements at the time of contracting.  It is not
necessary that there be a conscious acceptance of an insurer's liability on the
seller's part, nor is his obligation for consequential damages limited to cases
in which he fails to use due effort in good faith.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Particular needs of the buyer must generally be made known to
the seller while general needs must rarely be made known to charge the seller
with knowledge.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Any seller who does not wish to take the risk of
consequential damages has available the section on contractual limitation of
remedy.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  The burden of proving the extent of loss incurred by way
of consequential damage is on the buyer, but the section on liberal
administration of remedies rejects any doctrine of certainty which requires
almost mathematical precision in the proof of loss.  Loss may be determined in
any manner which is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Subsection (2)(b) states the usual rule as to breach of
warranty, allowing recovery for injuries &quot;proximately&quot; resulting from
the breach.  Where the injury involved follows the use of goods without
discovery of the defect causing the damage, the question of
&quot;proximate&quot; cause turns on whether it was reasonable for the buyer to
use the goods without such inspection as would have revealed the defects.  If
it was not reasonable for him to do so, or if he did in fact discover the
defect prior to his use, the injury would not proximately result from the
breach of warranty.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  In the case of sale of wares to one in the business of
reselling them, resale is one of the requirements of which the seller has
reason to know within the meaning of subsection (2)(a).</p>
