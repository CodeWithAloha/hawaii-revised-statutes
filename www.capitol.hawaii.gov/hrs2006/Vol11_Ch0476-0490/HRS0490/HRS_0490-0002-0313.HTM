<div class=Section1>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-313</b>  Express warranties by
affirmation, promise, description, sample.  (1)  Express warranties by the
seller are created as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the
seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of
the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the
affirmation or promise.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Any description of the goods which is made part
of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall
conform to the description.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   Any sample or model which is made part of the
basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods
shall conform to the sample or model.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  It is not necessary to the creation of an
express warranty that the seller use formal words such as &quot;warrant&quot;
or &quot;guarantee&quot; or that he have a specific intention to make a
warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement
purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does
not create a warranty. [L 1965, c 208, §2-313; HRS §490:2-313]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: </b> Sections 12, 14
and 16, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:  </b>Rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes of Changes:  </b>To consolidate and systematize
basic principles with the result that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  &quot;Express&quot; warranties rest on
&quot;dickered&quot; aspects of the individual bargain, and go so clearly to
the essence of that bargain that words of disclaimer in a form are repugnant to
the basic dickered terms.  &quot;Implied&quot; warranties rest so clearly on a
common factual situation or set of conditions that no particular language or
action is necessary to evidence them and they will arise in such a situation
unless unmistakably negated.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section reverts to the older case law insofar as the
warranties of description and sample are designated &quot;express&quot; rather
than &quot;implied&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Although this section is limited in its scope and direct
purpose to warranties made by the seller to the buyer as part of a contract for
sale, the warranty sections of this Article are not designed in any way to
disturb those lines of case law growth which have recognized that warranties
need not be confined either to sales contracts or to the direct parties to such
a contract.  They may arise in other appropriate circumstances such as in the
case of bailments for hire, whether such bailment is itself the main contract
or is merely a supplying of containers under a contract for the sale of their
contents.  The provisions of Section 2-318 on third party beneficiaries
expressly recognize this case law development within one particular area. 
Beyond that, the matter is left to the case law with the intention that the
policies of this Act may offer useful guidance in dealing with further cases as
they arise.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The present section deals with affirmations of fact by
the seller, descriptions of the goods or exhibitions of samples, exactly as any
other part of a negotiation which ends in a contract is dealt with.  No
specific intention to make a warranty is necessary if any of these factors is
made part of the basis of the bargain.  In actual practice affirmations of fact
made by the seller about the goods during a bargain are regarded as part of the
description of those goods; hence no particular reliance on such statements
need be shown in order to weave them into the fabric of the agreement.  Rather,
any fact which is to take such affirmations, once made, out of the agreement
requires clear affirmative proof.  The issue normally is one of fact.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  In view of the principle that the whole purpose of the
law of warranty is to determine what it is that the seller has in essence
agreed to sell, the policy is adopted of those cases which refuse except in
unusual circumstances to recognize a material deletion of the seller's
obligation.  Thus, a contract is normally a contract for a sale of something
describable and described.  A clause generally disclaiming &quot;all
warranties, express or implied&quot; cannot reduce the seller's obligation with
respect to such description and therefore cannot be given literal effect under
Section 2-316.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This is not intended to mean that the parties, if they
consciously desire, cannot make their own bargain as they wish.  But in
determining what they have agreed upon good faith is a factor and consideration
should be given to the fact that the probability is small that a real price is
intended to be exchanged for a pseudo-obligation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Paragraph (1)(b) makes specific some of the principles
set forth above when a description of the goods is given by the seller.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A description need not be by words.  Technical
specifications, blueprints and the like can afford more exact description than
mere language and if made part of the basis of the bargain goods must conform
with them.  Past deliveries may set the description of quality, either
expressly or impliedly by course of dealing.  Of course, all descriptions by
merchants must be read against the applicable trade usages with the general
rules as to merchantability resolving any doubts.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  The basic situation as to statements affecting the true
essence of the bargain is no different when a sample or model is involved in
the transaction.  This section includes both a &quot;sample&quot; actually
drawn from the bulk of goods which is the subject matter of the sale, and a
&quot;model&quot; which is offered for inspection when the subject matter is
not at hand and which has not been drawn from the bulk of the goods.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although the underlying principles are unchanged, the facts
are often ambiguous when something is shown as illustrative, rather than as a
straight sample.  In general, the presumption is that any sample or model just
as any affirmation of fact is intended to become a basis of the bargain.  But
there is no escape from the question of fact.  When the seller exhibits a
sample purporting to be drawn from an existing bulk, good faith of course
requires that the sample be fairly drawn.  But in mercantile experience the
mere exhibition of a &quot;sample&quot; does not of itself show whether it is
merely intended to &quot;suggest&quot; or to &quot;be&quot; the character of
the subject matter of the contract.  The question is whether the seller has so
acted with reference to the sample as to make him responsible that the whole
shall have at least the values shown by it.  The circumstances aid in answering
this question.  If the sample has been drawn from an existing bulk, it must be
regarded as describing values of the goods contracted for unless it is
accompanied by an unmistakable denial of such responsibility.  If, on the other
hand, a model of merchandise not on hand is offered, the mercantile presumption
that it has become a literal description of the subject matter is not so
strong, and particularly so if modification on the buyer's initiative impairs
any feature of the model.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  The precise time when words of description or affirmation
are made or samples are shown is not material.  The sole question is whether
the language or samples or models are fairly to be regarded as part of the
contract.  If language is used after the closing of the deal (as when the buyer
when taking delivery asks and receives an additional assurance), the warranty
becomes a modification, and need not be supported by consideration if it is
otherwise reasonable and in order (Section 2-209).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  8.  Concerning affirmations of value or a seller's opinion or
commendation under subsection (2), the basic question remains the same:  What
statements of the seller have in the circumstances and in objective judgment
become part of the basis of the bargain?  As indicated above, all of the
statements of the seller do so unless good reason is shown to the contrary. 
The provisions of subsection (2) are included, however, since common experience
discloses that some statements or predictions cannot fairly be viewed as entering
into the bargain.  Even as to false statements of value, however, the
possibility is left open that a remedy may be provided by the law relating to
fraud or misrepresentation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>The foundation of every express warranty provision is
the core description; defendant offered an express warranty on the artwork. 
745 F. Supp. 1556.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A breach of express warranty action could be a basis for a
derivative wrongful death action brought pursuant to §663-3.  86 H. 383 (App.),
949 P.2d 1004.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Reliance is not an essential element of a breach of express
warranty claim under the UCC.  86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Seller's contractual description of crane as being equipped
with 30-inch-wide treads was part of basis of bargain with buyer, and
constituted an express warranty which seller breached when it delivered crane
with 24-inch-wide treads.  86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the UCC, a seller's statements to a buyer regarding
goods sold, made during the bargaining process, are presumptively part of the
basis of the bargain between seller and buyer; thus burden is on seller to
prove that resulting bargain did not rest at all on seller's statements.  86 H.
383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where no evidence that advertisements were given to buyer as
part of bargaining process, were part of contract documents, or that buyer read
or was even aware of advertisements, advertisements did not become part of
basis of the bargain amounting to an express warranty.  86 H. 383 (App.), 949
P.2d 1004.</p>
