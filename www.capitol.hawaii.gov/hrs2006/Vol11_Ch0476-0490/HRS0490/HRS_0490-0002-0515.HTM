<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-515  Preserving evidence of goods in
dispute.</b>  In furtherance of the adjustment of any claim or dispute</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Either party on reasonable notification to the
other and for the purpose of ascertaining the facts and preserving evidence has
the right to inspect, test and sample the goods including such of them as may
be in the possession or control of the other; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   The parties may agree to a third party inspection
or survey to determine the conformity or condition of the goods and may agree
that the findings shall be binding upon them in any subsequent litigation or
adjustment. [L 1965, c 208, §2-515; HRS §490:2-515]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  To meet certain serious problems which arise when there
is a dispute as to the quality of the goods and thereby perhaps to aid the
parties in reaching a settlement, and to further the use of devices which will
promote certainty as to the condition of the goods, or at least aid in
preserving evidence of their condition.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Under paragraph (a), to afford either party an
opportunity for preserving evidence, whether or not agreement has been reached,
and thereby to reduce uncertainty in any litigation and, in turn perhaps, to
promote agreement.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Paragraph (a) does not conflict with the provisions on the
seller's right to resell rejected goods or the buyer's similar right.  Apparent
conflict between these provisions which will be suggested in certain
circumstances is to be resolved by requiring prompt action by the parties.  Nor
does paragraph (a) impair the effect of a term for payment before inspection. 
Short of such defects as amount to fraud or substantial failure of
consideration, non-conformity is neither an excuse nor a defense to an action
for non-acceptance of documents.  Normally, therefore, until the buyer has made
payment, inspected and rejected the goods, there is no occasion or use for the
rights under paragraph (a).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Under paragraph (b), to provide for third party
inspection upon the agreement of the parties, thereby opening the door to
amicable adjustments based upon the findings of such third parties.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The use of the phrase &quot;conformity or condition&quot;
makes it clear that the parties' agreement may range from a complete settlement
of all aspects of the dispute by a third party to the use of a third party
merely to determine and record the condition of the goods so that they can be
resold or used to reduce the stake in controversy.  &quot;Conformity&quot;, at
one end of the scale of possible issues, includes the whole question of
interpretation of the agreement and its legal effect, the state of the goods in
regard to quality and condition, whether any defects are due to factors which
operate at the risk of the buyer, and the degree of non- conformity where that
may be material.  &quot;Condition&quot;, at the other end of the scale,
includes nothing but the degree of damage or deterioration which the goods
show.  Paragraph (b) is intended to reach any point in the gamut which the
parties may agree upon.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The principle of the section on reservation of rights
reinforces this paragraph in simplifying such adjustments as the parties wish
to make in partial settlement while reserving their rights as to any further
points.  Paragraph (b) also suggests the use of arbitration, where desired, of
any points left open, but nothing in this section is intended to repeal or
amend any statute governing arbitration.  Where any question arises as to the
extent of the parties' agreement under the paragraph, the presumption should be
that it was meant to extend only to the relation between the contract
description and the goods as delivered, since that is what a craftsman in the
trade would normally be expected to report upon.  Finally, a written and
authenticated report of inspection or tests by a third party, whether or not
sampling has been practicable, is entitled to be admitted as evidence under
this Act, for it is a third party document.</p>
