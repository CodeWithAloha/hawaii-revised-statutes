<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-306  Output, requirements and
exclusive dealings.</b>  (1)  A term which measures the quantity by the output
of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or
requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably
disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate
to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be
tendered or demanded.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  A lawful agreement by either the seller or
the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless
otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the
goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale. [L 1965, c
208, §2-306; HRS §490:2-306]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b> </b> <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Subsection (1) of this section, in regard to output and
requirements, applies to this specific problem the general approach of this Act
which requires the reading of commercial background and intent into the
language of any agreement and demands good faith in the performance of that
agreement.  It applies to such contracts of nonproducing establishments such as
dealers or distributors as well as to manufacturing concerns.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Under this Article, a contract for output or requirements
is not too indefinite since it is held to mean the actual good faith output or
requirements of the particular party.  Nor does such a contract lack mutuality
of obligation since, under this section, the party who will determine quantity
is required to operate his plant or conduct his business in good faith and
according to commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade so that his
output or requirements will approximate a reasonably foreseeable figure. 
Reasonable elasticity in the requirements is expressly envisaged by this
section and good faith variations from prior requirements are permitted even
when the variation may be such as to result in discontinuance.  A shut-down by
a requirements buyer for lack of orders might be permissible when a shut-down
merely to curtail losses would not.  The essential test is whether the party is
acting in good faith.  Similarly, a sudden expansion of the plant by which
requirements are to be measured would not be included within the scope of the
contract as made but normal expansion undertaken in good faith would be within
the scope of this section.  One of the factors in an expansion situation would
be whether the market price had risen greatly in a case in which the
requirements contract contained a fixed price.  Reasonable variation of an
extreme sort is exemplified in Southwest Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma Portland
Cement Co., 102 F.2d 630 (C.C.A. 10, 1939).  This Article takes no position as
to whether a requirements contract is a provable claim in bankruptcy.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  If an estimate of output or requirements is included in
the agreement, no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to it may be tendered
or demanded.  Any minimum or maximum set by the agreement shows a clear limit
on the intended elasticity.  In similar fashion, the agreed estimate is to be
regarded as a center around which the parties intend the variation to occur.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  When an enterprise is sold, the question may arise
whether the buyer is bound by an existing output or requirements contract. 
That question is outside the scope of this Article, and is to be determined on
other principles of law.  Assuming that the contract continues, the output or
requirements in the hands of the new owner continue to be measured by the
actual good faith output or requirements under the normal operation of the
enterprise prior to sale.  The sale itself is not grounds for sudden expansion
or decrease.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Subsection (2), on exclusive dealing, makes explicit the
commercial rule embodied in this Act under which the parties to such contracts
are held to have impliedly, even when not expressly, bound themselves to use
reasonable diligence as well as good faith in their performance of the
contract.  Under such contracts the exclusive agent is required, although no
express commitment has been made, to use reasonable effort and due diligence in
the expansion of the market or the promotion of the product, as the case may
be.  The principal is expected under such a contract to refrain from supplying
any other dealer or agent within the exclusive territory.  An exclusive dealing
agreement brings into play all of the good faith aspects of the output and
requirement problems of subsection (1).  It also raises questions of insecurity
and right to adequate assurance under this Article.</p>
