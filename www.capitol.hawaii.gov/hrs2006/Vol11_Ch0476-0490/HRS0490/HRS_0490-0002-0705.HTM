<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-705  Seller's stoppage of delivery in
transit or otherwise.</b>  (1)  The seller may stop delivery of goods in the
possession of a carrier or other bailee when he discovers the buyer to be
insolvent (section 490:2-702) and may stop delivery of carload, truckload,
planeload or larger shipments of express or freight when the buyer repudiates
or fails to make a payment due before delivery or if for any other reason the
seller has a right to withhold or reclaim the goods.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  As against such buyer the seller may stop
delivery until</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Receipt of the goods by the buyer; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Acknowledgment to the buyer by any bailee of the
goods except a carrier that the bailee holds the goods for the buyer; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   Such acknowledgment to the buyer by a carrier by
reshipment or as a warehouse; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (d)   Negotiation to the buyer of any negotiable
document of title covering the goods.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  (a)  To stop delivery the seller must so notify
as to enable the bailee by reasonable diligence to prevent delivery of the
goods.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   After such notification the bailee must hold and
deliver the goods according to the directions of the seller but the seller is
liable to the bailee for any ensuing charges or damages.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   If a negotiable document of title has been issued
for goods the bailee is not obliged to obey a notification to stop until
surrender of possession or control of the document.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (d)   A carrier who has issued a nonnegotiable bill of
lading is not obliged to obey a notification to stop received from a person
other than the consignor. [L 1965, c 208, §2-705; HRS §490:2-705; am L 2004, c
163, §14]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Sections 57-59, Uniform Sales Act; see also Sections 12, 14 and 42, Uniform
Bills of Lading Act and Sections 9, 11 and 49, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  This section continues and develops the
above sections of the Uniform Sales Act in the light of the other uniform
statutory provisions noted.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b>  To make it clear that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Subsection (1) applies the stoppage principle to other
bailees as well as carriers.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  It also expands the remedy to cover the situations, in
addition to buyer's insolvency, specified in the subsection.  But since
stoppage is a burden in any case to carriers, and might be a very heavy burden
to them if it covered all small shipments in all these situations, the right to
stop for reasons other than insolvency is limited to carload, truckload,
planeload or larger shipments.  The seller shipping to a buyer of doubtful
credit can protect himself by shipping C.O.D.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where stoppage occurs for insecurity it is merely a
suspension of performance, and if assurances are duly forthcoming from the
buyer the seller is not entitled to resell or divert.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Improper stoppage is a breach by the seller if it effectively
interferes with the buyer's right to due tender under the section on manner of
tender of delivery.  However, if the bailee obeys an unjustified order to stop
he may also be liable to the buyer.  The measure of his obligation is dependent
on the provisions of the Documents of Title Article (Section 7-303). 
Subsection 3(b) therefore gives him a right of indemnity as against the seller
in such a case.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  &quot;Receipt by the buyer&quot; includes receipt by the
buyer's designated representative, the sub-purchaser, when shipment is made
direct to him and the buyer himself never receives the goods.  It is entirely
proper under this Article that the seller, by making such direct shipment to
the sub-purchaser, be regarded as acquiescing in the latter's purchase and as
thus barred from stoppage of the goods as against him.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As between the buyer and the seller, the latter's right to
stop the goods at any time until they reach the place of final delivery is
recognized by this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under subsection (3)(c) and (d), the carrier is under no duty
to recognize the stop order of a person who is a stranger to the carrier's
contract.  But the seller's right as against the buyer to stop delivery
remains, whether or not the carrier is obligated to recognize the stop order. 
If the carrier does obey it, the buyer cannot complain merely because of that
circumstance; and the seller becomes obligated under subsection (3)(b) to pay
the carrier any ensuing damages or charges.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  A diversion of a shipment is not a &quot;reshipment&quot;
under subsection (2)(c) when it is merely an incident to the original contract
of transportation.  Nor is the procurement of &quot;exchange bills&quot; of
lading which change only the name of the consignee to that of the buyer's local
agent but do not alter the destination of a reshipment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Acknowledgment by the carrier as a &quot;warehouseman&quot;
within the meaning of this Article requires a contract of a truly different
character from the original shipment, a contract not in extension of transit
but as a warehouseman.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Subsection (3)(c) makes the bailee's obedience of a
notification to stop conditional upon the surrender of any outstanding
negotiable document.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Any charges or losses incurred by the carrier in
following the seller's orders, whether or not he was obligated to do so, fall
to the seller's charge.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  After an effective stoppage under this section the
seller's rights in the goods are the same as if he had never made a delivery.</p>
