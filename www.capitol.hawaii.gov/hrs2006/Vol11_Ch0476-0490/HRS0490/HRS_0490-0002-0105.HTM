<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-105  Definitions:  transferability;
&quot;goods&quot;; &quot;future&quot; goods; &quot;lot&quot;; &quot;commercial
unit&quot;.</b>  (1)  &quot;Goods&quot; means all things (including specially
manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the
contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid,
investment securities (Article 8) and things in action.  &quot;Goods&quot; also
includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified
things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed
from realty (section 490:2-107).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Goods must be both existing and identified
before any interest in them can pass.  Goods which are not both existing and
identified are &quot;future&quot; goods.  A purported present sale of future
goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  There may be a sale of a part interest in
existing identified goods.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  An undivided share in an identified bulk
of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity
of the bulk is not determined.  Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any
quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the
extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then
becomes an owner in common.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (5)  &quot;Lot&quot; means a parcel or a single
article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or
not it is sufficient to perform the contract.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (6)  &quot;Commercial unit&quot; means such a
unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and
division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in
use.  A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of
articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as
a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant
market as a single whole. [L 1965, c 208, §2-105; HRS §490:2-105]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </b>Subsections (1),
(2), (3) and (4) - Sections 5, 6 and 76, Uniform Sales Act; Subsections (5) and
(6) - none.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>1.  Subsection (1) on &quot;goods&quot;:  The
phraseology of the prior uniform statutory provision has been changed so that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The definition of goods is based on the concept of movability
and the term &quot;chattels personal&quot; is not used.  It is not intended to
deal with things which are not fairly identifiable as movables before the
contract is performed.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Growing crops are included within the definition of goods
since they are frequently intended for sale.  The concept of
&quot;industrial&quot; growing crops has been abandoned, for under modern
practices fruit, perennial hay, nursery stock and the like must be brought
within the scope of this Article.  The young of animals are also included
expressly in this definition since they, too, are frequently intended for sale
and may be contracted for before birth.  The period of gestation of domestic
animals is such that the provisions of the section on identification can apply
as in the case of crops to be planted.  The reason of this definition also
leads to the inclusion of a wool crop or the like as &quot;goods&quot; subject
to identification under this Article.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The exclusion of &quot;money in which the price is to be
paid&quot; from the definition of goods does not mean that foreign currency
which is included in the definition of money may not be the subject matter of a
sales transaction.  Goods is intended to cover the sale of money when money is
being treated as a commodity but not to include it when money is the medium of
payment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As to contracts to sell timber, minerals, or structures to be
removed from the land Section 2-107(1) (Goods to be severed from Realty:
recording) controls.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The use of the word &quot;fixtures&quot; is avoided in view
of the diversity of definitions of that term.  This Article in including within
its scope &quot;things attached to realty&quot; adds the further test that they
must be capable of severance without material harm thereto.  As between the
parties any identified things which fall within that definition become
&quot;goods&quot; upon the making of the contract for sale.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Investment securities&quot; are expressly excluded from
the coverage of this Article.  It is not intended by this exclusion, however,
to prevent the application of a particular section of this Article by analogy
to securities (as was done with the Original Sales Act in Agar v. Orda, 264
N.Y. 248, 190 N.E. 479, 99 A.L.R. 269 (1934)) when the reason of that section
makes such application sensible and the situation involved is not covered by
the Article of this Act dealing specifically with such securities (Article 8).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  References to the fact that a contract for sale can
extend to future or contingent goods and that ownership in common follows the
sale of a part interest have been omitted here as obvious without need for
expression; hence no inference to negate these principles should be drawn from
their omission.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Subsection (4) does not touch the question of how far an
appropriation of a bulk of fungible goods may or may not satisfy the contract
for sale.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Subsections (5) and (6) on &quot;lot&quot; and
&quot;commercial unit&quot; are introduced to aid in the phrasing of later
sections.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  The question of when an identification of goods takes
place is determined by the provisions of Section 2-501 and all that this
section says is what kinds of goods may be the subject of a sale.</p>
