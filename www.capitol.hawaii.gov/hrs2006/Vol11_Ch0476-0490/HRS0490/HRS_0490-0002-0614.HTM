<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-614  Substituted performance.</b> 
(1)  Where without fault of either party the agreed berthing, loading, or
unloading facilities fail or an agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or
the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable but
a commercially reasonable substitute is available, such substitute performance
must be tendered and accepted.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  If the agreed means or manner of payment
fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation, the seller may
withhold or stop delivery unless the buyer provides a means or manner of
payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent.  If delivery has
already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the
regulation discharges the buyer's obligation unless the regulation is
discriminatory, oppressive or predatory. [L 1965, c 208, §2-614; HRS
§490:2-614]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Subsection (1) requires the tender of a commercially
reasonable substituted performance where agreed to facilities have failed or
become commercially impracticable.  Under this Article, in the absence of
specific agreement, the normal or usual facilities enter into the agreement
either through the circumstances, usage of trade or prior course of dealing.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section appears between Section 2-613 on casualty to
identified goods and the next section on excuse by failure of presupposed
conditions, both of which deal with excuse and complete avoidance of the
contract where the occurrence or non-occurrence of a contingency which was a
basic assumption of the contract makes the expected performance impossible. 
The distinction between the present section and those sections lies in whether
the failure or impossibility of performance arises in connection with an
incidental matter or goes to the very heart of the agreement.  The differing
lines of solution are contrasted in a comparison of International Paper Co. v.
Rockefeller, 161 App. Div. 180, 146 N.Y.S. 371 (1914) and Meyer v. Sullivan, 40
Cal. App. 723, 181 P. 847 (1919).  In the former case a contract for the sale
of spruce to be cut from a particular tract of land was involved.  When a fire
destroyed the trees growing on that tract the seller was held excused since performance
was impossible.  In the latter case the contract called for delivery of wheat
&quot;f.o.b. Kosmos Steamer at Seattle.&quot;  The war led to cancellation of
that line's sailing schedule after space had been duly engaged and the buyer
was held entitled to demand substituted delivery at the warehouse on the line's
loading dock.  Under this Article, of course, the seller would also be
entitled, had the market gone the other way, to make a substituted tender in
that manner.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There must, however, be a true commercial impracticability to
excuse the agreed to performance and justify a substituted performance.  When
this is the case a reasonable substituted performance tendered by either party
should excuse him from strict compliance with contract terms which do not go to
the essence of the agreement.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The substitution provided in this section as between
buyer and seller does not carry over into the obligation of a financing agency
under a letter of credit, since such an agency is entitled to performance which
is plainly adequate on its face and without need to look into commercial
evidence outside of the documents.  See Article 5, especially Sections 5-102,
5-103, 5-109, 5-110, 5-114.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Under subsection (2) where the contract is still
executory on both sides, the seller is permitted to withdraw unless the buyer
can provide him with a commercially equivalent return despite the governmental
regulation.  Where, however, only the debt for the price remains, a larger
leeway is permitted.  The buyer may pay in the manner provided by the
regulation even though this may not be commercially equivalent provided that
the regulation is not &quot;discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.&quot;</p>
