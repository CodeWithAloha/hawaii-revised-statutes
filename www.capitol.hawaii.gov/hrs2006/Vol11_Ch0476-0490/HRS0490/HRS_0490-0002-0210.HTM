<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-210  Delegation of performance;
assignment of rights. </b> (1)  A party may perform the party's duty through a
delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial
interest in having the other party's original promisor perform or control the
acts required by the contract.  No delegation of performance relieves the party
delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Except as otherwise provided in section
490:9-406, unless otherwise agreed, all rights of either seller or buyer can be
assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the
other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on the other
party by the other party's contract, or impair materially the other party's chance
of obtaining return performance.  A right to damages for breach of the whole
contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of the
assignor's entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  The creation, attachment, perfection, or
enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is
not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the
burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of
obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and
then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of
material performance of the seller.  Even in that event, the creation,
attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain
effective, but:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   The seller is liable to the buyer for damages
caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be
prevented by the buyer; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   A court having jurisdiction may grant other
appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an
injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the
enforcement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  Unless the circumstances indicate the
contrary a prohibition of assignment of &quot;the contract&quot; is to be
construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's
performance.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (5)  An assignment of &quot;the contract&quot;
or of &quot;all my rights under the contract&quot; or an assignment in similar
general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the
circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a
delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by
the assignee constitutes a promise by the assignee to perform those duties. 
This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the
original contract.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (6)  The other party may treat any assignment
which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and
may without prejudice to the other party's rights against the assignor demand
assurances from the assignee (section 490:2-609). [L 1965, c 208, §2-210; HRS
§490:2-210; am L 2000, c 241, §12 and gen ch 2000]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes> <b> Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Generally, this section recognizes both delegation of
performance and assignability as normal and permissible incidents of a contract
for the sale of goods.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Delegation of performance, either in conjunction with an
assignment or otherwise, is provided for by subsection (1) where no substantial
reason can be shown as to why the delegated performance will not be as
satisfactory as personal performance.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Under subsection (2) rights which are no longer executory
such as a right to damages for breach or a right to payment of an
&quot;account&quot; as defined in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article
9) may be assigned although the agreement prohibits assignment.  In such cases
no question of delegation of any performance is involved.  The assignment of a
&quot;contract right&quot; as defined in the Article on Secured Transactions
(Article 9) is not covered by this subsection.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  The nature of the contract or the circumstances of the
case, however, may bar assignment of the contract even where delegation of
performance is not involved.  This Article and this section are intended to
clarify this problem, particularly in cases dealing with output requirement and
exclusive dealing contracts.  In the first place the section on requirements and
exclusive dealing removes from the construction of the original contract most
of the &quot;personal discretion&quot; element by substituting the reasonably
objective standard of good faith operation of the plant or business to be
supplied.  Secondly, the section on insecurity and assurances, which is
specifically referred to in subsection (5) of this section, frees the other
party from the doubts and uncertainty which may afflict him under an assignment
of the character in question by permitting him to demand adequate assurance of
due performance without which he may suspend his own performance.  Subsection
(5) is not in any way intended to limit the effect of the section on insecurity
and assurances and the word &quot;performance&quot; includes the giving of orders
under a requirements contract.  Of course, in any case where a material
personal discretion is sought to be transferred, effective assignment is barred
by subsection (2).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Subsection (4) lays down a general rule of construction
distinguishing between a normal commercial assignment, which substitutes the
assignee for the assignor both as to rights and duties, and a financing
assignment in which only the assignor's rights are transferred.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This Article takes no position on the possibility of
extending some recognition or power to the original parties to work out normal
commercial readjustments of the contract in the case of financing assignments
even after the original obligor has been notified of the assignment.  This
question is dealt with in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Subsection (5) recognizes that the non-assigning original
party has a stake in the reliability of the person with whom he has closed the
original contract, and is, therefore, entitled to due assurance that any
delegated performance will be properly forthcoming.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  This section is not intended as a complete statement of
the law of delegation and assignment but is limited to clarifying a few points
doubtful under the case law.  Particularly, neither this section nor this
Article touches directly on such questions as the need or effect of notice of
the assignment, the rights of successive assignees, or any question of the form
of an assignment, either as between the parties or as against any third
parties.  Some of these questions are dealt with in Article 9.</p>
