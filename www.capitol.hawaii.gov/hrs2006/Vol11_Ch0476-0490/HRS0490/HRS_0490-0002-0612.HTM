<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-612  &quot;Installment
contract&quot;; breach.</b>  (1)  An &quot;installment contract&quot; is one
which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be
separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause &quot;each
delivery is a separate contract&quot; or its equivalent.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  The buyer may reject any installment which
is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that
installment and cannot be cured or if the nonconformity is a defect in the
required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection
(3) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept
that installment.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Whenever nonconformity or default with
respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the
whole contract there is a breach of the whole.  But the aggrieved party
reinstates the contract if he accepts a nonconforming installment without
seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect
only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments. [L
1965, c 208, §2-612; HRS §490:2-612]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 45(2), Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  To continue prior
law but to make explicit the more mercantile interpretation of many of the
rules involved, so that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The definition of an installment contract is phrased more
broadly in this Article so as to cover installment deliveries tacitly
authorized by the circumstances or by the option of either party.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  In regard to the apportionment of the price for separate
payment this Article applies the more liberal test of what can be apportioned
rather than the test of what is clearly apportioned by the agreement.  This
Article also recognizes approximate calculation or apportionment of price
subject to subsequent adjustment.  A provision for separate payment for each
lot delivered ordinarily means that the price is at least roughly calculable by
units of quantity, but such a provision is not essential to an
&quot;installment contract.&quot;  If separate acceptance of separate
deliveries is contemplated, no generalized contrast between wholly
&quot;entire&quot; and wholly &quot;divisible&quot; contracts has any standing
under this Article.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  This Article rejects any approach which gives clauses
such as &quot;each delivery is a separate contract&quot; their legalistically
literal effect.  Such contracts nonetheless call for installment deliveries. 
Even where a clause speaks of &quot;a separate contract for all purposes&quot;,
a commercial reading of the language under the section on good faith and
commercial standards requires that the singleness of the document and the
negotiation, together with the sense of the situation, prevail over any
uncommercial and legalistic interpretation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  One of the requirements for rejection under subsection
(2) is non-conformity substantially impairing the value of the installment in
question.  However, an installment agreement may require accurate conformity in
quality as a condition to the right to acceptance if the need for such
conformity is made clear either by express provision or by the circumstances. 
In such a case the effect of the agreement is to define explicitly what amounts
to substantial impairment of value impossible to cure.  A clause requiring
accurate compliance as a condition to the right to acceptance must, however,
have some basis in reason, must avoid imposing hardship by surprise and is
subject to waiver or to displacement by practical construction.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Substantial impairment of the value of an installment can
turn not only on the quality of the goods but also on such factors as time,
quantity, assortment, and the like.  It must be judged in terms of the normal
or specifically known purposes of the contract.  The defect in required
documents refers to such matters as the absence of insurance documents under a
C.I.F. contract, falsity of a bill of lading, or one failing to show shipment
within the contract period or to the contract destination.  Even in such cases,
however, the provisions on cure of tender apply if appropriate documents are
readily procurable.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Under subsection (2) an installment delivery must be
accepted if the non-conformity is curable and the seller gives adequate
assurance of cure.  Cure of non-conformity of an installment in the first
instance can usually be afforded by an allowance against the price, or in the
case of reasonable discrepancies in quantity either by a further delivery or a
partial rejection.  This Article requires reasonable action by a buyer in
regard to discrepant delivery and good faith requires that the buyer make any
reasonable minor outlay of time or money necessary to cure an overshipment by
severing out an acceptable percentage thereof.  The seller must take over a cure
which involves any material burden; the buyer's obligation reaches only to
cooperation.  Adequate assurance for purposes of subsection (2) is measured by
the same standards as under the section on right to adequate assurance of
performance.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Subsection (3) is designed to further the continuance of
the contract in the absence of an overt cancellation.  The question arising
when an action is brought as to a single installment only is resolved by making
such action waive the right of cancellation.  This involves merely a defect in
one or more installments, as contrasted with the situation where there is a
true repudiation within the section on anticipatory repudiation.  Whether the
non-conformity in any given installment justifies cancellation as to the future
depends, not on whether such non-conformity indicates an intent or likelihood
that the future deliveries will also be defective, but whether the non-
conformity substantially impairs the value of the whole contract.  If only the
seller's security in regard to future installments is impaired, he has the
right to demand adequate assurances of proper future performance but has not an
immediate right to cancel the entire contract.  It is clear under this Article,
however, that defects in prior installments are cumulative in effect, so that
acceptance does not wash out the defect &quot;waived.&quot;  Prior policy is
continued, putting the rule as to buyer's default on the same footing as that
in regard to seller's default.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Under the requirement of seasonable notification of
cancellation under subsection (3), a buyer who accepts a non-conforming
installment which substantially impairs the value of the entire contract should
properly be permitted to withhold his decision as to whether or not to cancel
pending a response from the seller as to his claim for cure or adjustment. 
Similarly, a seller may withhold a delivery pending payment for prior ones, at
the same time delaying his decision as to cancellation.  A reasonable time for
notifying of cancellation, judged by commercial standards under the section on
good faith, extends of course to include the time covered by any reasonable
negotiation in good faith.  However, during this period the defaulting party is
entitled, on request, to know whether the contract is still in effect, before
he can be required to perform further.</p>
