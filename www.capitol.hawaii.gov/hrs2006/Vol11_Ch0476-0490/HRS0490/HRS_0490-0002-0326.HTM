<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-326  Sale on approval and sale or
return; rights of creditors.</b>  (1)  Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered
goods may be returned by the buyer even though they conform to the contract,
the transaction is:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   A &quot;sale on approval&quot; if the goods are delivered
primarily for use; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   A &quot;sale or return&quot; if the goods are
delivered primarily for resale.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Goods held on approval are not subject to
the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance; goods held on sale or
return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Any &quot;or return&quot; term of a
contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the
statute of frauds section of this Article (section 490:2-201) and as
contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this
Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 490:2-202). [L 1965, c 208,
§2-326; HRS §490:2-326; am L 2000, c 241, §13]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 19(3), Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Completely rewritten in this and the
succeeding section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  To make it clear
that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  A &quot;sale on approval&quot; or &quot;sale or
return&quot; is distinct from other types of transactions with which they have
frequently been confused.  The type of &quot;sale on approval,&quot; &quot;on
trial&quot; or &quot;on satisfaction&quot; dealt with involves a contract under
which the seller undertakes a particular business risk to satisfy his
prospective buyer with the appearance or performance of the goods in question.  The
goods are delivered to the proposed purchaser but they remain the property of
the seller until the buyer accepts them.  The price has already been agreed. 
The buyer's willingness to receive and test the goods is the consideration for
the seller's engagement to deliver and sell.  The type of &quot;sale or
return&quot; involved herein is a sale to a merchant whose unwillingness to buy
is overcome only by the seller's engagement to take back the goods (or any
commercial unit of goods) in lieu of payment if they fail to be resold.  These
two transactions are so strongly delineated in practice and in general
understanding that every presumption runs against a delivery to a consumer
being a &quot;sale or return&quot; and against a delivery to a merchant for
resale being a &quot;sale on approval.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The right to return the goods for failure to conform to the
contract does not make the transaction a &quot;sale on approval&quot; or
&quot;sale or return&quot; and has nothing to do with this and the following
section.  The present section is not concerned with remedies for breach of
contract.  It deals instead with a power given by the contract to turn back the
goods even though they are wholly as warranted.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section nevertheless presupposes that a contract for
sale is contemplated by the parties although that contract may be of the
peculiar character here described.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the buyer's obligation as a buyer is conditioned not on
his personal approval but on the article's passing a described objective test,
the risk of loss by casualty pending the test is properly the seller's and
proper return is at his expense.  On the point of &quot;satisfaction&quot; as
meaning &quot;reasonable satisfaction&quot; where an industrial machine is
involved, this Article takes no position.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Pursuant to the general policies of this Act which
require good faith not only between the parties to the sales contract, but as
against interested third parties, subsection (3) resolves all reasonable doubts
as to the nature of the transaction in favor of the general creditors of the
buyer.  As against such creditors words such as &quot;on consignment&quot; or
&quot;on memorandum&quot;, with or without words of reservation of title in the
seller, are disregarded when the buyer has a place of business at which he
deals in goods of the kind involved.  A necessary exception is made where the
buyer is known to be engaged primarily in selling the goods of others or is
selling under a relevant sign law, or the seller complies with the filing
provisions of Article 9 as if his interest were a security interest.  However,
there is no intent in this Section to narrow the protection afforded to third
parties in any jurisdiction which has a selling Factors Act.  The purpose of
the exception is merely to limit the effect of the present subsection itself,
in the absence of any such Factors Act, to cases in which creditors of the
buyer may reasonably be deemed to have been misled by the secret reservation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Subsection (4) resolves a conflict in the pre-existing
case law by recognition that an &quot;or return&quot; provision is so
definitely at odds with any ordinary contract for sale of goods that where
written agreements are involved it must be contained in a written memorandum. 
The &quot;or return&quot; aspect of a sales contract must be treated as a
separate contract under the Statute of Frauds section and as contradicting the
sale insofar as questions of parol or extrinsic evidence are concerned.</p>
