<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   If the seller is authorized to send the goods the

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Sections 42 and 47(2), Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Completely rewritten in this and other
sections.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  This section is
drawn to reflect modern business methods of dealing at a distance rather than
face to face.  Thus:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Paragraph (a) provides that payment is due at the time
and place &quot;the buyer is to receive the goods&quot; rather than at the
point of delivery except in documentary shipment cases (paragraph (c)).  This
grants an opportunity for the exercise by the buyer of his preliminary right to
inspection before paying even though under the delivery term the risk of loss
may have previously passed to him or the running of the credit period has
already started.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Paragraph (b) while providing for inspection by the buyer
before he pays, protects the seller.  He is not required to give up possession
of the goods until he has received payment, where no credit has been
contemplated by the parties.  The seller may collect through a bank by a sight
draft against an order bill of lading &quot;hold until arrival; inspection
allowed.&quot;  The obligations of the bank under such a provision are set
forth in Part 5 of Article 4.  In the absence of a credit term, the seller is
permitted to ship under reservation and if he does payment is then due where
and when the buyer is to receive the documents.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Unless otherwise agreed, the place for the receipt of the
documents and payment is the buyer's city but the time for payment is only
after arrival of the goods, since under paragraph (b), and Sections 2-512 and
2-513 the buyer is under no duty to pay prior to inspection.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Where the mode of shipment is such that goods must be
unloaded immediately upon arrival, too rapidly to permit adequate inspection
before receipt, the seller must be guided by the provisions of this Article on
inspection which provide that if the seller wishes to demand payment before
inspection, he must put an appropriate term into the contract.  Even requiring
payment against documents will not of itself have this desired result if the
documents are to be held until the arrival of the goods.  But under (b) and (c)
if the terms are C.I.F., C.O.D., or cash against documents payment may be due
before inspection.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Paragraph (d) states the common commercial understanding
that an agreed credit period runs from the time of shipment or from that dating
of the invoice which is commonly recognized as a representation of the time of
shipment.  The provision concerning any delay in sending forth the invoice is
included because such conduct results in depriving the buyer of his full notice
and warning as to when he must be prepared to pay.</p>
