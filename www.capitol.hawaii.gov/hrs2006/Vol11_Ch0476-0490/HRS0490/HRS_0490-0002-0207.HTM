<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-207  Additional terms in acceptance
or confirmation.</b>  (1)  A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance
or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an
acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those
offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on
assent to the additional or different terms.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  The additional terms are to be construed
as proposals for addition to the contract.  Between merchants such terms become
part of the contract unless:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   The offer expressly limits acceptance to the
terms of the offer;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   They materially alter it; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   Notification of objection to them has already
been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is
received.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Conduct by both parties which recognizes
the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale
although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract.  In
such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which
the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms
incorporated under any other provisions of this chapter. [L 1965, c 208,
§2-207; HRS §490:2-207]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b> </b> <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Completely rewritten by this and other
sections of this Article.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  This section is intended to deal with two typical
situations.  The one is where an agreement has been reached either orally or by
informal correspondence between the parties and is followed by one or both of
the parties sending formal acknowledgments or memoranda embodying the terms so
far as agreed upon and adding terms not discussed.  The other situation is one
in which a wire or letter expressed and intended as the closing or confirmation
of an agreement adds further minor suggestions or proposals such as &quot;ship
by Tuesday,&quot; &quot;rush,&quot; &quot;ship draft against bill of lading
inspection allowed,&quot; or the like.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Under this Article a proposed deal which in commercial
understanding has in fact been closed is recognized as a contract.  Therefore,
any additional matter contained either in the writing intended to close the
deal or in a later confirmation falls within subsection (2) and must be
regarded as a proposal for an added term unless the acceptance is made
conditional on the acceptance of the additional terms.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Whether or not additional or different terms will become
part of the agreement depends upon the provisions of subsection (2).  If they
are such as materially to alter the original bargain, they will not be included
unless expressly agreed to by the other party.  If, however, they are terms
which would not so change the bargain they will be incorporated unless notice
of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable
time.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Examples of typical clauses which would normally
&quot;materially alter&quot; the contract and so result in surprise or hardship
if incorporated without express awareness by the other party are: a clause
negating such standard warranties as that of merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose in circumstances in which either warranty normally attaches;
a clause requiring a guaranty of 90% or 100% deliveries in a case such as a
contract by cannery, where the usage of the trade allows greater quantity
leeways; a clause reserving to the seller the power to cancel upon the buyer's
failure to meet any invoice when due; a clause requiring that complaints be
made in a time materially shorter than customary or reasonable.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Examples of clauses which involve no element of
unreasonable surprise and which therefore are to be incorporated in the
contract unless notice of objection is seasonably given are:  a clause setting
forth and perhaps enlarging slightly upon the seller's exemption due to
supervening causes beyond his control, similar to those covered by the
provision of this Article on merchant's excuse by failure of presupposed
conditions or a clause fixing in advance any reasonable formula of proration
under such circumstances; a clause fixing a reasonable time for complaints
within customary limits, or in the case of a purchase for sub-sale, providing
for inspection by the sub-purchaser; a clause providing for interest on overdue
invoices or fixing the seller's standard credit terms where they are within the
range of trade practice and do not limit any credit bargained for; a clause
limiting the right of rejection for defects which fall within the customary
trade tolerances for acceptance &quot;with adjustment&quot; or otherwise
limiting remedy in a reasonable manner (see Sections 2-718 and 2-719).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  If no answer is received within a reasonable time after
additional terms are proposed, it is both fair and commercially sound to assume
that their inclusion has been assented to.  Where clauses on confirming forms
sent by both parties conflict each party must be assumed to object to a clause
of the other conflicting with one on the confirmation sent by himself.  As a
result the requirement that there be notice of objection which is found in
subsection (2) is satisfied and the conflicting terms do not become a part of
the contract.  The contract then consists of the terms originally expressly
agreed to, terms on which the confirmations agree, and terms supplied by this
Act, including subsection (2).</p>
