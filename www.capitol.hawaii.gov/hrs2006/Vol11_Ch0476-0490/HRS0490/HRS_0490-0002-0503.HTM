<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-503  Manner of seller's tender of
delivery.</b>  (1)  Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold
conforming goods at the buyer's disposition and give the buyer any notification
reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery.  The manner, time and
place for tender are determined by the agreement and this Article, and in
particular</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is
of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to
enable the buyer to take possession; but</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish
facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Where the case is within the next section
respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Where the seller is required to deliver at
a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and
also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4)
and (5) of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  Where goods are in the possession of a
bailee and are to be delivered without being moved:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Tender requires that the seller either tender a
negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by
the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods; but</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document
of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender
unless the buyer seasonably objects, and except as otherwise provided in
Article 9, receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer's rights fixes
those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of
the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document
of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had
a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the
bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (5)  Where the contract requires the seller to
deliver documents:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   The seller must tender all such documents in
correct form, except as provided in this Article with respect to bills of
lading in a set (subsection (2) of section 490:2-323); and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Tender through customary banking channels is
sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the document
constitutes nonacceptance or rejection. [L 1965, c 208, §2-503; HRS §490:2-503;
am L 2004, c 163, §9]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
See Sections 11, 19, 20, 43 (3) and (4), 46 and 51, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  The general policy of the above sections is
continued and supplemented but subsection (3) changes the rule of prior section
19(5) as what constitutes a &quot;destination&quot; contract and subsection (4)
incorporates a minor correction as to tender of delivery of goods in the
possession of a bailee.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The major general rules governing the manner of proper or
due tender of delivery are gathered in this section.  The term
&quot;tender&quot; is used in this Article in two different senses.  In one
sense it refers to &quot;due tender&quot; which contemplates an offer coupled
with a present ability to fulfill all the conditions resting on the tendering
party and must be followed by actual performance if the other party shows himself
ready to proceed.  Unless the context unmistakably indicates otherwise this is
the meaning of &quot;tender&quot; in this Article and the occasional addition
of the word &quot;due&quot; is only for clarity and emphasis.  At other times
it is used to refer to an offer of goods or documents under a contract as if in
fulfillment of its conditions even though there is a defect when measured
against the contract obligation.  Used in either sense, however,
&quot;tender&quot; connotes such performance by the tendering party as puts the
other party in default if he fails to proceed in some manner.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The seller's general duty to tender and deliver is laid
down in Section 2-301 and more particularly in Section 2-507.  The seller's
right to a receipt if he demands one and receipts are customary is governed by
Section 1-205.  Subsection (1) of the present section proceeds to set forth two
primary requirements of tender: first, that the seller &quot;put and hold
conforming goods at the buyer's disposition&quot; and, second, that he
&quot;give the buyer any notice reasonably necessary to enable him to take
delivery.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In cases in which payment is due and demanded upon delivery
the &quot;buyer's disposition&quot; is qualified by the seller's right to
retain control of the goods until payment by the provision of this Article on
delivery on condition.  However, where the seller is demanding payment on
delivery he must first allow the buyer to inspect the goods in order to avoid
impairing his tender unless the contract for sale is on C.I.F., C.O.D., cash
against documents or similar terms negating the privilege of inspection before
payment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In the case of contracts involving documents the seller can
&quot;put and hold conforming goods at the buyer's disposition&quot; under
subsection (1) by tendering documents which give the buyer complete control of
the goods under the provisions of Article 7 on due negotiation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) usage of the trade
and the circumstances of the particular case determine what is a reasonable
hour for tender and what constitutes a reasonable period of holding the goods
available.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  The buyer must furnish reasonable facilities for the
receipt of the goods tendered by the seller under subsection (1), paragraph
(b).  This obligation of the buyer is no part of the seller's tender.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) there is
omitted from this Article the rule under prior uniform legislation that a term
requiring the seller to pay the freight or cost of transportation to the buyer
is equivalent to an agreement by the seller to deliver to the buyer or at an
agreed destination.  This omission is with the specific intention of negating
the rule, for under this Article the &quot;shipment&quot; contract is regarded
as the normal one and the &quot;destination&quot; contract as the variant
type.  The seller is not obligated to deliver at a named destination and bear
the concurrent risk of loss until arrival, unless he has specifically agreed so
to deliver or the commercial understanding of the terms used by the parties
contemplates such delivery.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Paragraph (a) of subsection (4) continues the rule of the
prior uniform legislation as to acknowledgment by the bailee.  Paragraph (b) of
subsection (4) adopts the rule that between the buyer and the seller the risk
of loss remains on the seller during a period reasonable for securing
acknowledgment of the transfer from the bailee, while as against all other
parties the buyer's rights are fixed as of the time the bailee receives notice
of the transfer.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Under subsection (5) documents are never &quot;required&quot;
except where there is an express contract term or it is plainly implicit in the
peculiar circumstances of the case or in a usage of trade.  Documents may, of
course, be &quot;authorized&quot; although not required, but such cases are not
within the scope of this subsection.  When documents are required, there are
three main requirements of this subsection:  (1) &quot;All&quot;:  each
required document is essential to a proper tender; (2) &quot;Such&quot;:  the
documents must be the ones actually required by the contract in terms of source
and substance; (3) &quot;Correct form&quot;:  All documents must be in correct
form.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When a prescribed document cannot be procured, a question of
fact arises under the provision of this Article on substituted performance as
to whether the agreed manner of delivery is actually commercially impracticable
and whether the substitute is commercially reasonable.</p>
