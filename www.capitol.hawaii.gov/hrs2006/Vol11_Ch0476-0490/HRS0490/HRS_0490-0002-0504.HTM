<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-504  Shipment by seller.</b>  Where
the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer and the
contract does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, then
unless otherwise agreed he must</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Put the goods in the possession of such a carrier
and make such a contract for their transportation as may be reasonable having
regard to the nature of the goods and other circumstances of the case; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Obtain and promptly deliver or tender in due form
any document necessary to enable the buyer to obtain possession of the goods or
otherwise required by the agreement or by usage of trade; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   Promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Failure to notify the buyer under paragraph (c)
or to make a proper contract under paragraph (a) is a ground for rejection only
if material delay or loss ensues. [L 1965, c 208, §2-504; HRS §490:2-504]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 46.  Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  To continue the
general policy of the prior uniform statutory provision while incorporating
certain modifications with respect to the requirement that the contract with
the carrier be made expressly on behalf of the buyer and as to the necessity of
giving notice of the shipment to the buyer, so that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The section is limited to &quot;shipment&quot; contracts
as contrasted with &quot;destination&quot; contracts or contracts for delivery
at the place where the goods are located.  The general principles embodied in
this section cover the special cases of F.O.B. point of shipment contracts and
C.I.F. and C. &amp; F. contracts.  Under the preceding section on manner of
tender of delivery, due tender by the seller requires that he comply with the
requirements of this section in appropriate cases.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The contract to be made with the carrier under paragraph
(a) must conform to all express terms of the agreement, subject to any
substitution necessary because of failure of agreed facilities as provided in
the later provision on substituted performance.  However, under the policies of
this Article on good faith and commercial standards and on buyer's rights on
improper delivery, the requirements of explicit provisions must be read in
terms of their commercial and not their literal meaning.  This policy is made
express with respect to bills of lading in a set in the provision of this
Article on form of bills of lading required in overseas shipment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  In the absence of agreement, the provision of this
Article on options and cooperation respecting performance gives the seller the
choice of any reasonable carrier, routing and other arrangements.  Whether or
not the shipment is at the buyer's expense the seller must see to any
arrangements, reasonable in the circumstances, such as refrigeration, watering
of live stock, protection against cold, the sending along of any necessary
help, selection of specialized cars and the like for paragraph (a) is intended
to cover all necessary arrangements whether made by contract with the carrier
or otherwise.  There is, however, a proper relaxation of such requirements if
the buyer is himself in a position to make the appropriate arrangements and the
seller gives him reasonable notice of the need to do so.  It is an improper
contract under paragraph (a) for the seller to agree with the carrier to a
limited valuation below the true value and thus cut off the buyer's opportunity
to recover from the carrier in the event of loss, when the risk of shipment is
placed on the buyer by his contract with the seller.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Both the language of paragraph (b) and the nature of the
situation it concerns indicate that the requirement that the seller must obtain
and deliver promptly to the buyer in due form any document necessary to enable
him to obtain possession of the goods is intended to cumulate with the other
duties of the seller such as those covered in paragraph (a).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In this connection, in the case of pool car shipments a
delivery order furnished by the seller on the pool car consignee, or on the
carrier for delivery out of a larger quantity, satisfies the requirements of
paragraph (b) unless the contract requires some other form of document.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  This Article, unlike the prior uniform statutory
provision, makes it the seller's duty to notify the buyer of shipment in all
cases.  The consequences of his failure to do so, however, are limited in that
the buyer may reject on this ground only where material delay or loss ensues.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A standard and acceptable manner of notification in open
credit shipments is the sending of an invoice and in the case of documentary
contracts is the prompt forwarding of the documents as under paragraph (b) of
this section.  It is also usual to send on a straight bill of lading but this
is not necessary to the required notification.  However, should such a document
prove necessary or convenient to the buyer, as in the case of loss and claim
against the carrier, good faith would require the seller to send it on request.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Frequently the agreement expressly requires prompt
notification as by wire or cable.  Such a term may be of the essence and the
final clause of paragraph (c) does not prevent the parties from making this a
particular ground for rejection.  To have this vital and irreparable effect
upon the seller's duties, such a term should be part of the
&quot;dickered&quot; terms written in any &quot;form,&quot; or should otherwise
be called seasonably and sharply to the seller's attention.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Generally, under the final sentence of the section,
rejection by the buyer is justified only when the seller's dereliction as to
any of the requirements of this section in fact is followed by material delay
or damage.  It rests on the seller, so far as concerns matters not within the
peculiar knowledge of the buyer, to establish that his error has not been
followed by events which justify rejection.</p>
