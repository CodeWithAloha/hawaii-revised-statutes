<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:4-214  Right of</b> <b>charge back or
refund; liability of collecting bank; return of item.  </b>(a)  If a collecting
bank has made provisional settlement with its customer for an item and fails by
reason of dishonor, suspension of payments by a bank, or otherwise to receive
settlement for the item which is or becomes final, the bank may revoke the
settlement given by it, charge back the amount of any credit given for the item
to its customer's account, or obtain refund from its customer, whether or not
it is able to return the item, if by its midnight deadline or within a longer
reasonable time after it learns the facts it returns the item or sends
notification of the facts.  If the return or notice is delayed beyond the
bank's midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts,
the bank may revoke the settlement, charge back the credit, or obtain refund
from its customer, but it is liable for any loss resulting from the delay. 
These rights to revoke, charge back, and obtain refund terminate if and when a
settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A collecting bank returns an item when it
is sent or delivered to the bank's customer or transferor or pursuant to its
instructions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A depositary bank that is also the payor
may charge back the amount of an item to its customer's account or obtain
refund in accordance with the section governing return of an item received by a
payor bank for credit on its books (section 490:4-301).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The right to charge back is not affected
by:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Previous use of a credit given for the item; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Failure by any bank to exercise ordinary care
with respect to the item, but a bank so failing remains liable.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A failure to charge back or claim refund
does not affect other rights of the bank against the customer or any other
party.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  If credit is given in dollars as the
equivalent of the value of an item payable in foreign money, the dollar amount
of any charge back or refund must be calculated on the basis of the bank-offered
spot rate for the foreign money prevailing on the day when the person entitled
to the charge back or refund learns that it will not receive payment in
ordinary course. [L 1965, c 208, §4-212; HRS §490:4-212; am and ren L 1991, c

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </b>None; but see
Sections 2 and 11, American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Under current bank practice, in a major portion of cases
banks make provisional settlement for items when they are first received and
then await subsequent determination of whether the item will be finally paid. 
This is the principal characteristic of what are referred to in banking
parlance as &quot;cash items&quot;.  Statistically, this practice of settling
provisionally first and then awaiting final payment is justified because more
than ninety-nine per cent of such cash items are finally paid, with the result
that in this great preponderance of cases it becomes unnecessary for the banks
making the provisional settlements to make any further entries.  In due course
the provisional settlements become final simply with the lapse of time. 
However, in those cases where the item being collected is not finally paid or
where for various reasons the bank making the provisional settlement does not
itself receive final payment, under the American Bankers Association Bank
Collection Code, under Federal Reserve Regulations and operating letters and
under various types of agreements between banks and between customers and
banks, provision is made for the reversal of the provisional settlements,
charge-back of provisional credits and the right to obtain refund.  Subsection
(1) codifies and simplifies the statement of these rights.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Various causes of a bank not receiving final payment,
with the resulting right of charge-back or refund, are stated or suggested in
subsection (1).  These include dishonor of the original item; dishonor of a
remittance instrument given for it; reversal of a provisional credit for the
item; suspension of payments by another bank.  The causes stated are
illustrative; the right of charge-back or refund is stated to exist whether the
failure to receive final payment in ordinary course arises through one of them
&quot;or otherwise&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The right of charge-back or refund exists if a collecting
bank has made a provisional settlement for an item with its customer but
terminates if and when a settlement received by the bank for the item is or
becomes final.  If the bank fails to receive such a final settlement the right
of charge-back or refund must be exercised promptly after the bank learns the
facts.  The right exists (if so promptly exercised) whether or not the bank is
able to return the item.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Subsection (2) is an affirmative provision for so-called
&quot;direct returns&quot;.  This is a new practice that is currently in the
process of developing in a few sections of the country.  Its purpose is to
speed up the return of unpaid items by avoiding handling by one or more
intermediate banks.  The subsection is bracketed because the practice is not
yet well established and some bankers and bank lawyers would prefer to let the
practice develop by agreement.  The contention is made that substantive rights
between banks may be affected, e.g. available set-offs, but proponents contend
advantages of direct returns outweigh possible detriments.  However, if the
subsection were omitted, the election to use direct returns would be on the
depositary bank and it would probably be necessary for that bank to
specifically authorize direct returns with each outgoing letter.  This is a
cumbersome way of meeting the problem.  If the subsection is retained the payor
bank, unless it has been specifically directed otherwise, will have the right
to make the decision whether it will return an unpaid item directly.  Since the
subsection is permissive and its inclusion tends toward greater flexibility,
its retention is recommended.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  The rule of subsection (4) relating to charge-back (as
distinguished from claim for refund) applies irrespective of the cause of the
nonpayment, and of the person ultimately liable for nonpayment.  Thus
charge-back is permitted even where nonpayment results from the depositary
bank's own negligence.  Any other rule would result in litigation based upon a
claim for wrongful dishonor of other checks of the customer, with potential
damages far in excess of the amount of the item.  Any other rule would require
a bank to determine difficult questions of fact.  The customer's protection is
found in the general obligation of good faith (Sections 1-203 and 4-103).  If
bad faith is established the customer's recovery &quot;includes other damages,
if any, suffered by the party as a proximate consequence&quot; (Section
4-103(5); see also Section 4-402).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  It is clear that the charge-back does not relieve the
bank from any liability for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling the
item.  The measure of damages for such failure is stated in Section 4-103(5).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Subsection (6) states a rule fixing the time for determining
the rate of exchange if there is a charge-back or refund of a credit given in
dollars for an item payable in a foreign currency.  Compare Section 3-107(2). 
Fixing such a rule is desirable to avoid disputes.  If in any case the parties
wish to fix a different time for determining the rate of exchange, they may do
so by agreement.</p>
