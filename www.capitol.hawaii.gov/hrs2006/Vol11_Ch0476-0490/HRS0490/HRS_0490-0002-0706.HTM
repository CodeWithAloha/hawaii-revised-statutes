<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-706  Seller's resale including
contract for resale.</b>  (1)  Under the conditions stated in section 490:2-703
on seller's remedies, the seller may resell the goods concerned or the
undelivered balance thereof.  Where the resale is made in good faith and in a
commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between
the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages
allowed under the provisions of this Article (section 490:2-710), but less
expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection
(3) or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale
including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to
an existing contract of the seller.  Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at
any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the
method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable.  The
resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but
it is not necessary that the goods be in existence or that any or all of them
have been identified to the contract before the breach.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Where the resale is at private sale the
seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  Where the resale is at public sale</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Only identified goods can be sold except where
there is a recognized market for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   It must be made at a usual place or market for
public sale if one is reasonably available and except in the case of goods
which are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily the seller must
give the buyer reasonable notice of the time and place of the resale; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   If the goods are not to be within the view of
those attending the sale the notification of sale must state the place where
the goods are located and provide for their reasonable inspection by
prospective bidders; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (d)   The seller may buy.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (5)  A purchaser who buys in good faith at a
resale takes the goods free of any rights of the original buyer even though the
seller fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (6)  The seller is not accountable to the buyer
for any profit made on any resale.  A person in the position of a seller
(section 490:2-707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably
revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security
interest, as hereinafter defined (subsection (3) of section 490:2-711). [L
1965, c 208, §2-706; HRS §490:2-706]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 60, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  To simplify the
prior statutory provision and to make it clear that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The only condition precedent to the seller's right of
resale under subsection (1) is a breach by the buyer within the section on the
seller's remedies in general or insolvency.  Other meticulous conditions and
restrictions of the prior uniform statutory provision are disapproved by this
Article and are replaced by standards of commercial reasonableness.  Under this
section the seller may resell the goods after any breach by the buyer.  Thus,
an anticipatory repudiation by the buyer gives rise to any of the seller's
remedies for breach, and to the right of resale.  This principle is
supplemented by subsection (2) which authorizes a resale of goods which are not
in existence or were not identified to the contract before the breach.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  In order to recover the damages prescribed in subsection
(1) the seller must act &quot;in good faith and in a commercially reasonable
manner&quot; in making the resale.  This standard is intended to be more
comprehensive than that of &quot;reasonable care and judgment&quot; established
by the prior uniform statutory provision.  Failure to act properly under this
section deprives the seller of the measure of damages here provided and
relegates him to that provided in Section 2-708.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under this Article the seller resells by authority of law, in
his own behalf, for his own benefit and for the purpose of fixing his damages. 
The theory of a seller's agency is thus rejected.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  If the seller complies with the prescribed standard of
duty in making the resale, he may recover from the buyer the damages provided
for in subsection (1).  Evidence of market or current prices at any particular
time or place is relevant only on the question of whether the seller acted in a
commercially reasonable manner in making the resale.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The distinction drawn by some courts between cases where the
title had not passed to the buyer and the seller had resold as owner, and cases
where the title had passed and the seller had resold by virtue of his lien on
the goods, is rejected.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Subsection (2) frees the remedy of resale from legalistic
restrictions and enables the seller to resell in accordance with reasonable
commercial practices so as to realize as high a price as possible in the
circumstances.  By &quot;public&quot; sale is meant a sale by auction.  A &quot;private&quot;
sale may be effected by solicitation and negotiation conducted either directly
or through a broker.  In choosing between a public and private sale the
character of the goods must be considered and relevant trade practices and
usages must be observed.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Subsection (2) merely clarifies the common law rule that
the time for resale is a reasonable time after the buyer's breach, by using the
language &quot;commercially reasonable.&quot;  What is such a reasonable time
depends upon the nature of the goods, the condition of the market and the other
circumstances of the case; its length cannot be measured by any legal yardstick
or divided into degrees.  Where a seller contemplating resale receives a demand
from the buyer for inspection under the section of preserving evidence of goods
in dispute, the time for resale may be appropriately lengthened.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  On the question of the place for resale, subsection (2) goes
to the ultimate test, the commercial reasonableness of the seller's choice as
to the place for an advantageous resale.  This Article rejects the theory that
the seller is required to resell at the agreed place for delivery and that a
resale elsewhere can be permitted only in exceptional cases.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  The purpose of subsection (2) being to enable the seller
to dispose of the goods to the best advantage, he is permitted in making the
resale to depart from the terms and conditions of the original contract for
sale to any extent &quot;commercially reasonable&quot; in the circumstances.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  The provision of subsection (2) that the goods need not
be in existence to be resold applies when the buyer is guilty of anticipatory
repudiation of a contract for future goods, before the goods or some of them
have come into existence.  In such a case the seller may exercise the right of
resale and fix his damages by &quot;one or more contracts to sell&quot; the
quantity of conforming future goods affected by the repudiation.  The companion
provision of subsection (2) that resale may be made although the goods were not
identified to the contract prior to the buyer's breach, likewise contemplates
an anticipatory repudiation by the buyer but occurring after the goods are in
existence.  If the goods so identified conform to the contract, their resale
will fix the seller's damages quite as satisfactorily as if they had been
identified before the breach.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  8.  Where the resale is to be by private sale, subsection (3)
requires that reasonable notification of the seller's intention to resell must
be given to the buyer.  The length of notification of a private sale depends
upon the urgency of the matter.  Notification of the time and place of this
type of sale is not required.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (4)(b) requires that the seller give the buyer
reasonable notice of the time and place of a public resale so that he may have
an opportunity to bid or to secure the attendance of other bidders.  An
exception is made in the case of goods &quot;which are perishable or threaten
to decline speedily in value.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  9.  Since there would be no reasonable prospect of
competitive bidding elsewhere, subsection (4) requires that a public resale
&quot;must be made at a usual place or market for public sale if one is
reasonably available;&quot; i.e., a place or market which prospective bidders
may reasonably be expected to attend.  Such a market may still be &quot;reasonably
available&quot; under this subsection, though at a considerable distance from
the place where the goods are located.  In such a case the expense of
transporting the goods for resale is recoverable from the buyer as part of the
seller's incidental damages under subsection (1).  However, the question of
availability is one of commercial reasonableness in the circumstances and if
such &quot;usual&quot; place or market is not reasonably available, a duly
advertised public resale may be held at another place if it is one which
prospective bidders may reasonably be expected to attend, as distinguished from
a place where there is no demand whatsoever for goods of the kind.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Paragraph (a) of subsection (4) qualifies the last sentence
of subsection (2) with respect to resales of unidentified and future goods at
public sale.  If conforming goods are in existence the seller may identify them
to the contract after the buyer's breach and then resell them at public sale. 
If the goods have not been identified, however, he may resell them at public
sale only as &quot;future&quot; goods and only where there is a recognized
market for public sale of futures in goods of the kind.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The provisions of paragraph (c) of subsection (4) are
intended to permit intelligent bidding.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The provision of paragraph (d) of subsection (4) permitting
the seller to bid and, of course, to become the purchaser, benefits the
original buyer by tending to increase the resale price and thus decreasing the
damages he will have to pay.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  10.  This Article departs in subsection (5) from the prior
uniform statutory provision in permitting a good faith purchaser at resale to
take a good title as against the buyer even though the seller fails to comply
with the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  11.  Under subsection (6), the seller retains profit, if any,
without distinction based on whether or not he had a lien since this Article
divorces the question of passage of title to the buyer from the seller's right
of resale or the consequences of its exercise.  On the other hand, where
&quot;a person in the position of a seller&quot; or a buyer acting under the
section on buyer's remedies, exercises his right of resale under the present
section he does so only for the limited purpose of obtaining cash for his
&quot;security interest&quot; in the goods.  Once that purpose has been
accomplished any excess in the resale price belongs to the seller to whom an
accounting must be made as provided in the last sentence of subsection (6).</p>
