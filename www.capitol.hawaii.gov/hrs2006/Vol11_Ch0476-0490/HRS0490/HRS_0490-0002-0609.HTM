<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-609  Right to adequate assurance of
performance.</b>  (1)  A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party
that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be
impaired.  When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the
performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance
of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially
reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the
agreed return.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Between merchants the reasonableness of
grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be
determined according to commercial standards.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Acceptance of any improper delivery or
payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate
assurance of future performance.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  After receipt of a justified demand
failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days such
assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular
case is a repudiation of the contract. [L 1965, c 208, §2-609; HRS §490:2-609]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
See Sections 53, 54(1)(b), 55 and 63(2), Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The section rests on the recognition of the fact that the
essential purpose of a contract between commercial men is actual performance
and they do not bargain merely for a promise, or for a promise plus the right
to win a lawsuit and that a continuing sense of reliance and security that the
promised performance will be forthcoming when due, is an important feature of
the bargain.  If either the willingness or the ability of a party to perform
declines materially between the time of contracting and the time for
performance, the other party is threatened with the loss of a substantial part
of what he has bargained for.  A seller needs protection not merely against
having to deliver on credit to a shaky buyer, but also against having to
procure and manufacture the goods, perhaps turning down other customers.  Once
he has been given reason to believe that the buyer's performance has become
uncertain, it is an undue hardship to force him to continue his own
performance.  Similarly, a buyer who believes that the seller's deliveries have
become uncertain cannot safely wait for the due date of performance when he has
been buying to assure himself of materials for his current manufacturing or to
replenish his stock of merchandise.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Three measures have been adopted to meet the needs of commercial
men in such situations.  First, the aggrieved party is permitted to suspend his
own performance and any preparation therefor, with excuse for any resulting
necessary delay, until the situation has been clarified.  &quot;Suspend
performance&quot; under this section means to hold up performance pending the
outcome of the demand, and includes also the holding up of any preparatory
action.  This is the same principle which governs the ancient law of stoppage
and seller's lien, and also of excuse of a buyer from prepayment if the
seller's actions manifest that he cannot or will not perform.  (Original Act,
Section 63(2).)</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Secondly, the aggrieved party is given the right to require
adequate assurance that the other party's performance will be duly
forthcoming.  This principle is reflected in the familiar clauses permitting
the seller to curtail deliveries if the buyer's credit becomes impaired, which
when held within the limits of reasonableness and good faith actually express
no more than the fair business meaning of any commercial contract.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Third, and finally, this section provides the means by which
the aggrieved party may treat the contract as broken if his reasonable grounds
for insecurity are not cleared up within a reasonable time.  This is the
principle underlying the law of anticipatory breach, whether by way of
defective part performance or by repudiation.  The present section merges these
three principles of law and commercial practice into a single theory of general
application to all sales agreements looking to future performance.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Subsection (2) of the present section requires that
&quot;reasonable&quot; grounds and &quot;adequate&quot; assurance as used in
subsection (1) be defined by commercial rather than legal standards.  The
express reference to commercial standards carries no connotation that the
obligation of good faith is not equally applicable here.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under commercial standards and in accord with commercial
practice, a ground for insecurity need not arise from or be directly related to
the contract in question.  The law as to &quot;dependence&quot; or
&quot;independence&quot; of promises within a single contract does not control
the application of the present section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Thus a buyer who falls behind in &quot;his account&quot; with
the seller, even though the items involved have to do with separate and legally
distinct contracts, impairs the seller's expectation of due performance. 
Again, under the same test, a buyer who requires precision parts which he
intends to use immediately upon delivery, may have reasonable grounds for
insecurity if he discovers that his seller is making defective deliveries of
such parts to other buyers with similar needs.  Thus, too, in a situation such
as arose in Jay Dreher Corporation v. Delco Appliance Corporation, 93 F.2d 275
(C.C.A.2, 1937), where a manufacturer gave a dealer an exclusive franchise for
the sale of his product but on two or three occasions breached the exclusive
dealing clause, although there was no default in orders, deliveries or payments
under the separate sales contract between the parties, the aggrieved dealer
would be entitled to suspend his performance of the contract for sale under the
present section and to demand assurance that the exclusive dealing contract
would be lived up to.  There is no need for an explicit clause tying the exclusive
franchise into the contract for the sale of goods since the situation itself
ties the agreements together.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The nature of the sales contract enters also into the
question of reasonableness.  For example, a report from an apparently
trustworthy source that the seller had shipped defective goods or was planning
to ship them would normally give the buyer reasonable grounds for insecurity. 
But when the buyer has assumed the risk of payment before inspection of the
goods, as in a sales contract on C.I.F. or similar cash against documents
terms, that risk is not to be evaded by a demand for assurance.  Therefore no
ground for insecurity would exist under this section unless the report went to
a ground which would excuse payment by the buyer.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  What constitutes &quot;adequate&quot; assurance of due
performance is subject to the same test of factual conditions.  For example,
where the buyer can make use of a defective delivery, a mere promise by a
seller of good repute that he is giving the matter his attention and that the
defect will not be repeated, is normally sufficient.  Under the same
circumstances, however, a similar statement by a known corner-cutter might well
be considered insufficient without the posting of a guaranty or, if so demanded
by the buyer, a speedy replacement of the delivery involved.  By the same token
where a delivery has defects, even though easily curable, which interfere with
easy use by the buyer, no verbal assurance can be deemed adequate which is not
accompanied by replacement, repair, money-allowance, or other commercially
reasonable cure.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A fact situation such as arose in Corn Products Refining Co.
v. Fasola, 94 N.J.L. 181, 109 A. 505 (1920) offers illustration both of
reasonable grounds for insecurity and &quot;adequate&quot; assurance.  In that
case a contract for the sale of oils on 30 days' credit, 2% off for payment
within 10 days, provided that credit was to be extended to the buyer only if
his financial responsibility was satisfactory to the seller.  The buyer had
been in the habit of taking advantage of the discount but at the same time that
he failed to make his customary 10 day payment, the seller heard rumors, in
fact false, that the buyer's financial condition was shaky.  Thereupon, the
seller demanded cash before shipment or security satisfactory to him.  The
buyer sent a good credit report from his banker, expressed willingness to make
payments when due on the 30 day terms and insisted on further deliveries under
the contract.  Under this Article the rumors, although false, were enough to
make the buyer's financial condition &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; to the seller
under the contract clause.  Moreover, the buyer's practice of taking the cash
discounts is enough, apart from the contract clause, to lay a commercial
foundation for suspicion when the practice is suddenly stopped.  These matters,
however, go only to the justification of the seller's demand for security, or
his &quot;reasonable grounds for insecurity&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The adequacy of the assurance given is not measured as in the
type of &quot;satisfaction&quot; situation affected with intangibles, such as
in personal service cases, cases involving a third party's judgment as final,
or cases in which the whole contract is dependent on one party's satisfaction,
as in a sale on approval.  Here, the seller must exercise good faith and
observe commercial standards.  This Article thus approves the statement of the
court in James B. Berry's Sons Co. of Illinois v. Monark Gasoline &amp; Oil
Co., Inc., 32 F.2d 74, (C.C.A. 8, 1929), that the seller's satisfaction under such
a clause must be based upon reason and must not be arbitrary or capricious; and
rejects the purely personal &quot;good faith&quot; test of the Corn Products
Refining Co. case, which held that in the seller's sole judgment, if for any
reason he was dissatisfied, he was entitled to revoke the credit.  In the
absence of the buyer's failure to take the 2% discount as was his custom, the
banker's report given in that case would have been &quot;adequate&quot;
assurance under this Act, regardless of the language of the &quot;satisfaction&quot;
clause.  However, the seller is reasonably entitled to feel insecure at a
sudden expansion of the buyer's use of a credit term, and should be entitled
either to security or to a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The entire foregoing discussion as to adequacy of assurance
by way of explanation is subject to qualification when repeated occasions for
the application of this section arise.  This Act recognizes that repeated
delinquencies must be viewed as cumulative.  On the other hand, commercial
sense also requires that if repeated claims for assurance are made under this
section, the basis for these claims must be increasingly obvious.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  A failure to provide adequate assurance of performance
and thereby to re-establish the security of expectation, results in a breach
only &quot;by repudiation&quot; under subsection (4).  Therefore, the
possibility is continued of retraction of the repudiation under the section
dealing with that problem, unless the aggrieved party has acted on the breach
in some manner.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The thirty day limit on the time to provide assurance is laid
down to free the question of reasonable time from uncertainty in later
litigation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Clauses seeking to give the protected party exceedingly
wide powers to cancel or readjust the contract when ground for insecurity
arises must be read against the fact that good faith is a part of the
obligation of the contract and not subject to modification by agreement and
includes, in the case of a merchant, the reasonable observance of commercial
standards of fair dealing in the trade.  Such clauses can thus be effective to
enlarge the protection given by the present section to a certain extent, to fix
the reasonable time within which requested assurance must be given, or to
define adequacy of the assurance in any commercially reasonable fashion.  But
any clause seeking to set up arbitrary standards for action is ineffective
under this Article.  Acceleration clauses are treated similarly in the Articles
on Commercial Paper and Secured Transactions.</p>
