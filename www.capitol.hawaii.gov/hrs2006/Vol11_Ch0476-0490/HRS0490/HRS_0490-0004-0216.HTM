<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:4-216  Insolvency and preference.  </b>(a) 
If an item is in or comes into the possession of a payor or collecting bank
that suspends payment and the item has not been finally paid, the item must be
returned by the receiver, trustee, or agent in charge of the closed bank to the
presenting bank or the closed bank's customer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If a payor bank finally pays an item and
suspends payments without making a settlement for the item with its customer or
the presenting bank which settlement is or becomes final, the owner of the item
has a preferred claim against the payor bank.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If a payor bank gives or a collecting bank
gives or receives a provisional settlement for an item and thereafter suspends
payments, the suspension does not prevent or interfere with the settlement's
becoming final if the finality occurs automatically upon the lapse of certain
time or the happening of certain events.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If a collecting bank receives from
subsequent parties settlement for an item, which settlement is or becomes final
and the bank suspends payments without making a settlement for the item with
its customer which settlement is or becomes final, the owner of the item has a
preferred claim against the collecting bank. [L 1965, c 208, §4-214; HRS

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  None; but see
Section 13.  American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The underlying purpose of the provisions of this section
is not to confer upon banks, holders of items or anyone else preferential
positions in the event of bank failures over general depositors or any other
creditors of the failed banks.  The purpose is to fix as definitely as possible
the cut-off point of time for the completion or cessation of the collection
process in the case of items that happen to be in such process at the time a
particular bank suspends payments.  It must be remembered that in bank
collections as a whole and in the handling of items by an individual bank,
items go through a whole series of processes.  It must also be remembered that
at any particular point of time a particular bank (at least one of any size) is
functioning as a depositary bank for some items, as an intermediary bank for
others, as a presenting bank for still others and as a payor bank for still
others, and that when it suspends payments it will have close to its normal
load of items working through its various processes.  For the convenience of
receivers, owners of items, banks, and in fact substantially everyone
concerned, it is recognized that at the particular moment of time that a bank
suspends payment, a certain portion of the items being handled by it have
progressed far enough in the bank collection process that it is preferable to
permit them to continue the remaining distance, rather than to send them back
and reverse the many entries that have been made or the steps that have been
taken with respect to them.  Therefore, having this background and these
purposes in mind, the section states what items must be turned backward at the
moment suspension intervenes and what items have progressed far enough that the
collection process with respect to them continues, with the resulting necessary
statement of rights of various parties flowing from this prescription of the
cut-off time.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The rules stated are similar to those stated in the
American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code, but with the abandonment of
any theory of trust.  Although for practical purposes Federal Deposit Insurance
affects materially the result of bank failures on holders of items and banks,
no attempt is made to vary the rules of the section by reason of such
insurance.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  It is recognized that in view of Jennings v. United
States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 294 U.S. 216, 55 S.Ct. 394, 79 L.Ed. 869,
99 A.L.R. 1248 (1935), amendment of the National Bank Act would be necessary to
have this section apply to national banks.  But there is no reason why it
should not apply to others.  See Section 1-108.</p>
