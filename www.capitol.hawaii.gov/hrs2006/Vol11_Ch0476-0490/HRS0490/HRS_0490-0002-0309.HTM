<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-309  Absence of specific time
provisions; notice of termination.</b>  (1)  The time for shipment or delivery
or any other action under a contract if not provided in this Article or agreed
upon shall be a reasonable time.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Where the contract provides for successive
performances but is indefinite in duration it is valid for a reasonable time
but unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at any time by either party.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Termination of a contract by one party
except on the happening of an agreed event requires that reasonable
notification be received by the other party and an agreement dispensing with
notification is invalid if its operation would be unconscionable. [L 1965, c
208, §2-309; HRS §490:2-309]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  Subsection (1) -
see Sections 43(2), 45(2), 47(1) and 48, Uniform Sales Act, for policy
continued under this Article; Subsection (2) - none; Subsection (3) - none.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:  </b>Completely different in scope.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Subsection (1) requires that all actions taken under a
sales contract must be taken within a reasonable time where no time has been
agreed upon.  The reasonable time under this provision turns on the criteria as
to &quot;reasonable time&quot; and on good faith and commercial standards set
forth in Sections 1-203, 1-204 and 2-103.  It thus depends upon what
constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in view of the nature, purpose and
circumstances of the action to be taken.  Agreement as to a definite time,
however, may be found in a term implied from the contractual circumstances,
usage of trade or course of dealing or performance as well as in an express
term.  Such cases fall outside of this subsection since in them the time for
action is &quot;agreed&quot; by usage.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The time for payment, where not agreed upon, is related
to the time for delivery; the particular problems which arise in connection
with determining the appropriate time of payment and the time for any
inspection before payment which is both allowed by law and demanded by the
buyer are covered in Section 2-513.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The facts in regard to shipment and delivery differ so
widely as to make detailed provision for them in the text of this Article
impracticable.  The applicable principles, however, make it clear that surprise
is to be avoided, good faith judgment is to be protected, and notice or
negotiation to reduce the uncertainty to certainty is to be favored.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  When the time for delivery is left open, unreasonably
early offers of or demands for delivery are intended to be read under this
Article as expressions of desire or intention, requesting the assent or
acquiescence of the other party, not as final positions which may amount
without more to breach or to create breach by the other side.  See Sections
2-207 and 2-609.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  The obligation of good faith under this Act requires
reasonable notification before a contract may be treated as breached because a
reasonable time for delivery or demand has expired.  This operates both in the
case of a contract originally indefinite as to time and of one subsequently
made indefinite by waiver.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When both parties let an originally reasonable time go by in
silence, the course of conduct under the contract may be viewed as enlarging
the reasonable time for tender or demand of performance.  The contract may be
terminated by abandonment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Parties to a contract are not required in giving
reasonable notification to fix, at peril of breach, a time which is in fact
reasonable in the unforeseeable judgment of a later trier of fact.  Effective
communication of a proposed time limit calls for a response, so that failure to
reply will make out acquiescence.  Where objection is made, however, or if the
demand is merely for information as to when goods will be delivered or will be
ordered out, demand for assurances on the ground of insecurity may be made
under this Article pending further negotiations.  Only when a party insists on
undue delay or on rejection of the other party's reasonable proposal is there a
question of flat breach under the present section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Subsection (2) applies a commercially reasonable view to
resolve the conflict which has arisen in the cases as to contracts of
indefinite duration.  The &quot;reasonable time&quot; of duration appropriate
to a given arrangement is limited by the circumstances.  When the arrangement
has been carried on by the parties over the years, the &quot;reasonable
time&quot; can continue indefinitely and the contract will not terminate until
notice.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  8.  Subsection (3) recognizes that the application of
principles of good faith and sound commercial practice normally call for such
notification of the termination of a going contract relationship as will give
the other party reasonable time to seek a substitute arrangement.  An agreement
dispensing with notification or limiting the time for the seeking of a
substitute arrangement is, of course, valid under this subsection unless the
results of putting it into operation would be the creation of an unconscionable
state of affairs.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  9.  Justifiable cancellation for breach is a remedy for
breach and is not the kind of termination covered by the present subsection.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  10.  The requirement of notification is dispensed with where
the contract provides for termination on the happening of an &quot;agreed event.&quot; 
&quot;Event&quot; is a term chosen here to contrast with &quot;option&quot; or
the like.</p>
