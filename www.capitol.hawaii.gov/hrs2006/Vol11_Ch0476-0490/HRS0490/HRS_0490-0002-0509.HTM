<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-509  Risk of loss in the absence of
breach.</b>  (1)  Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship
the goods by carrier</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   If it does not require him to deliver them at a
particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are
duly delivered to the carrier even though the shipment is under reservation
(section 490:2-505); but</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   If it does require him to deliver them at a
particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the
possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods
are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Where the goods are held by a bailee to be
delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the buyer:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   On the buyer's receipt of possession or control
of a negotiable document of title covering the goods;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   On acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's
right to possession of the goods; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   After the buyer's receipt of possession or
control of a nonnegotiable document of title or other direction to deliver in a
record, as provided in subsection (4)(b) of section 490:2-503.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  In any case not within subsection (1) or
(2), the risk of loss passes to the buyer on his receipt of the goods if the
seller is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the buyer on tender of
delivery.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  The provisions of this section are subject
to contrary agreement of the parties and to the provisions of this Article on
sale on approval (section 490:2-327) and on effect of breach on risk of loss
(section 490:2-510). [L 1965, c 208, §2-509; HRS §490:2-509; am L 2004, c 163,
§12]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 22, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten, subsection (3) of this section
modifying prior law.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  To make it clear
that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The underlying theory of these sections on risk of loss
is the adoption of the contractual approach rather than an arbitrary shifting
of the risk with the &quot;property&quot; in the goods.  The scope of the
present section, therefore, is limited strictly to those cases where there has
been no breach by the seller.  Where for any reason his delivery or tender
fails to conform to the contract, the present section does not apply and the situation
is governed by the provisions on effect of breach on risk of loss.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The provisions of subsection (1) apply where the contract
&quot;requires or authorizes&quot; shipment of the goods.  This language is
intended to be construed parallel to comparable language in the section on
shipment by seller.  In order that the goods be &quot;duly delivered to the
carrier&quot; under paragraph (a) a contract must be entered into with the
carrier which will satisfy the requirements of the section on shipment by the
seller and the delivery must be made under circumstances which will enable the
seller to take any further steps necessary to a due tender.  The underlying
reason of this subsection does not require that the shipment be made after
contracting, but where, for example, the seller buys the goods afloat and later
diverts the shipment to the buyer, he must identify the goods to the contract
before the risk of loss can pass.  To transfer the risk it is enough that a
proper shipment and a proper identification come to apply to the same goods
although, aside from special agreement, the risk will not pass retroactively to
the time of shipment in such a case.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Whether the contract involves delivery at the seller's
place of business or at the situs of the goods, a merchant seller cannot
transfer risk of loss and it remains upon him until actual receipt by the
buyer, even though full payment has been made and the buyer has been notified
that the goods are at his disposal.  Protection is afforded him, in the event
of breach by the buyer, under the next section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The underlying theory of this rule is that a merchant who is
to make physical delivery at his own place continues meanwhile to control the
goods and can be expected to insure his interest in them.  The buyer, on the
other hand, has no control of the goods and it is extremely unlikely that he
will carry insurance on goods not yet in his possession.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Where the agreement provides for delivery of the goods as
between the buyer and seller without removal from the physical possession of a
bailee, the provisions on manner of tender of delivery apply on the point of
transfer of risk.  Due delivery of a negotiable document of title covering the
goods or acknowledgment by the bailee that he holds for the buyer completes the
&quot;delivery&quot; and passes the risk.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  The provisions of this section are made subject by
subsection (4) to the &quot;contrary agreement&quot; of the parties.  This
language is intended as the equivalent of the phrase &quot;unless otherwise
agreed&quot; used more frequently throughout this Act.  &quot;Contrary&quot; is
in no way used as a word of limitation and the buyer and seller are left free
to readjust their rights and risks as declared by this section in any manner
agreeable to them.  Contrary agreement can also be found in the circumstances
of the case, a trade usage or practice, or a course of dealing or performance.</p>
