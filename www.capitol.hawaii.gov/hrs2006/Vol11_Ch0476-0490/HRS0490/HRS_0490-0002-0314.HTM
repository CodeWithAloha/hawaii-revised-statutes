<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-314  Implied warranty: 
merchantability; usage of trade.</b>  (1)  Unless excluded or modified (section
490:2-316), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a
contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of
that kind.  Under this section the serving for value of food or drink to be
consumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Goods to be merchantable must be at least
such as</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Pass without objection in the trade under the
contract description; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   In the case of fungible goods, are of fair
average quality within the description; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such
goods are used; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (d)   Run, within the variations permitted by the
agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all
units involved; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (e)   Are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled
as the agreement may require; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (f)   Conform to the promises or affirmations of fact
made on the container or label if any.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Unless excluded or modified (section
490:2-316) other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage
of trade. [L 1965, c 208, §2-314; HRS §490:2-314]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </b>Section 15(2),
Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:  </b>Completely rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes of Changes:  </b>This section, drawn in view of
the steadily developing case law on the subject, is intended to make it clear
that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The seller's obligation applies to present sales as well
as to contracts to sell subject to the effects of any examination of specific
goods.  (Subsection (2) of Section 2-316).  Also, the warranty of
merchantability applies to sales for use as well as to sales for resale.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The question when the warranty is imposed turns basically
on the meaning of the terms of the agreement as recognized in the trade.  Goods
delivered under an agreement made by a merchant in a given line of trade must
be of a quality comparable to that generally acceptable in that line of trade
under the description or other designation of the goods used in the agreement. 
The responsibility imposed rests on any merchant-seller, and the absence of the
words &quot;grower or manufacturer or not&quot; which appeared in Section 15(2)
of the Uniform Sales Act does not restrict the applicability of this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  A specific designation of goods by the buyer does not
exclude the seller's obligation that they be fit for the general purposes
appropriate to such goods.  A contract for the sale of second-hand goods, however,
involves only such obligation as is appropriate to such goods for that is their
contract description.  A person making an isolated sale of goods is not a
&quot;merchant&quot; within the meaning of the full scope of this section and,
thus, no warranty of merchantability would apply.  His knowledge of any defects
not apparent on inspection would, however, without need for express agreement
and in keeping with the underlying reason of the present section and the
provisions on good faith, impose an obligation that known material but hidden
defects be fully disclosed.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Although a seller may not be a &quot;merchant&quot; as to
the goods in question, if he states generally that they are
&quot;guaranteed&quot; the provisions of this section may furnish a guide to
the content of the resulting express warranty.  This has particular
significance in the case of second-hand sales, and has further significance in
limiting the effect of fine-print disclaimer clauses where their effect would
be inconsistent with large- print assertions of &quot;guarantee&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  The second sentence of subsection (1) covers the warranty
with respect to food and drink.  Serving food or drink for value is a sale,
whether to be consumed on the premises or elsewhere.  Cases to the contrary are
rejected.  The principal warranty is that stated in subsections (1) and (2)(c)
of this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Subsection (2) does not purport to exhaust the meaning of
&quot;merchantable&quot; nor to negate any of its attributes not specifically
mentioned in the text of the statute, but arising by usage of trade or through
case law.  The language used is &quot;must be at least such as...,&quot; and
the intention is to leave open other possible attributes of merchantability.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) are to be read
together.  Both refer, as indicated above, to the standards of that line of the
trade which fits the transaction and the seller's business.  &quot;Fair
average&quot; is a term directly appropriate to agricultural bulk products and
means goods centering around the middle belt of quality, not the least or the
worst that can be understood in the particular trade by the designation, but
such as can pass &quot;without objection.&quot; Of course a fair percentage of
the least is permissible but the goods are not &quot;fair average&quot; if they
are all of the least or worst quality possible under the description.  In cases
of doubt as to what quality is intended, the price at which a merchant closes a
contract is an excellent index of the nature and scope of his obligation under
the present section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  8.  Fitness for the ordinary purposes for which goods of the
type are used is a fundamental concept of the present section and is covered in
paragraph (c).  As stated above, merchantability is also a part of the
obligation owing to the purchaser for use.  Correspondingly, protection, under
this aspect of the warranty, of the person buying for resale to the ultimate
consumer is equally necessary, and merchantable goods must therefore be
&quot;honestly&quot; resalable in the normal course of business because they
are what they purport to be.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  9.  Paragraph (d) on evenness of kind, quality and quantity
follows case law.  But precautionary language has been added as a reminder of
the frequent usages of trade which permit substantial variations both with and
without an allowance or an obligation to replace the varying units.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  10.  Paragraph (e) applies only where the nature of the goods
and of the transaction require a certain type of container, package or label. 
Paragraph (f) applies, on the other hand, wherever there is a label or container
on which representations are made, even though the original contract, either by
express terms or usage of trade, may not have required either the labelling or
the representation.  This follows from the general obligation of good faith
which requires that a buyer should not be placed in the position of reselling
or using goods delivered under false representations appearing on the package
or container.  No problem of extra consideration arises in this connection
since, under this Article, an obligation is imposed by the original contract
not to deliver mislabeled articles, and the obligation is imposed where
mercantile good faith so requires and without reference to the doctrine of
consideration.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  11.  Exclusion or modification of the warranty of merchantability,
or of any part of it, is dealt with in the section to which the text of the
present section makes explicit precautionary references.  That section must be
read with particular reference to its subsection (4) on limitation of
remedies.  The warranty of merchantability, wherever it is normal, is so
commonly taken for granted that its exclusion from the contract is a matter
threatening surprise and therefore requiring special precaution.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  12.  Subsection (3) is to make explicit that usage of trade
and course of dealing can create warranties and that they are implied rather
than express warranties and thus subject to exclusion or modification under
Section 2-316.  A typical instance would be the obligation to provide pedigree
papers to evidence conformity of the animal to the contract in the case of a
pedigreed dog or blooded bull.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  13.  In an action based on breach of warranty, it is of
course necessary to show not only the existence of the warranty but the fact
that the warranty was broken and that the breach of the warranty was the
proximate cause of the loss sustained.  In such an action an affirmative
showing by the seller that the loss resulted from some action or event
following his own delivery of the goods can operate as a defense.  Equally,
evidence indicating that the seller exercised care in the manufacture,
processing or selection of the goods is relevant to the issue of whether the
warranty was in fact broken.  Action by the buyer following an examination of
the goods which ought to have indicated the defect complained of can be shown
as matter bearing on whether the breach itself was the cause of the injury.</p>
