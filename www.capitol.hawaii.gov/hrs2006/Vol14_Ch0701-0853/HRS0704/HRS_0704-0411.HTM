<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §704-411</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section rejects the concept of mandatory commitment
following a qualified acquittal on the basis of a physical or mental disease,
disorder, or defect which precluded defendant's responsibility.[1]  The Code
instead authorizes a flexible mode of disposition of defendants thus acquitted,
which depends on (1) the restraint necessary to protect other members of
society and the defendant from the consequences of a recurrence of the
prohibited conduct, and (2) the conditions necessary to afford the defendant
proper care and supervision.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Code recognizes three types of dispositions:  commitment,
conditional release, and discharge.  The Code utilizes the concept of
conditional release, which is presently recognized in the field of civil
commitment, but leaves the ultimate determination of the conditions of release
with the court, rather than with the medical authority to whom the defendant is
entrusted.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Since the defendant has been detained for a substantial
period of time for purposes of examination prior to the determination of the
defendant's lack of responsibility, the examiners, in an appropriate case, may
be able to indicate, at the trial or at a separate hearing, that commitment is
not called for.  In such a case, mandatory commitment followed by an
application for release or discharge would be abusive and wasteful. 
Furthermore, a disease, disorder, or defect excluding responsibility which is
influenced by biological or organic factors may be susceptible to adequate
treatment (by means of drugs or otherwise) on an out- patient basis without
danger to other members of society or may be such that repetition of the
prohibited conduct is foreclosed.  In such cases commitment should not be made
mandatory.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Proof of penally prohibited conduct at the time of the
alleged offense cannot be used as a justification for automatic commitment
following an acquittal based on lack of responsibility.[2]  A determination by
the court will have to be made as to whether the defendant's condition at the
time of disposition requires commitment, conditional release, or discharge. 
While proof of the commission of prohibited conduct and an acquittal predicated
on lack of responsibility at the time of the conduct are relevant to and
probative of present dangerousness, they are not substitutes for such a
finding.  Although the evidence at trial will be primarily devoted to a
determination of the defendant's physical and mental condition at the time of
the alleged offense, in certain cases the examiners may be able to indicate the
risks which the defendant presents.  In some cases a defendant, seeking to
avoid penal liability on the basis of physical or mental disease, disorder, or
defect excluding responsibility, may be quite willing to stipulate to the need
for commitment or conditional release following acquittal.  In such cases, it
should not be necessary to require that the court hold a separate hearing for
the purpose of determining the defendant's present condition and the risks the
defendant presents.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Code, therefore, provides in subsection (1) that the
disposition order may be made on the basis of medical evidence given either at
the trial or at a separate hearing.  In those instances where the court
believes that the evidence at trial is not sufficiently addressed to the risk
of danger which the defendant presents to allow a determination of that issue,
the court may order a separate hearing.  Where either the prosecution or the
defense believes that the evidence at the trial (including stipulations) is not
dispositive of the issue of present danger, each is free to move for a separate
post-acquittal hearing on that issue.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (3) provides that the procedure to be followed
with respect to a separate post-acquittal hearing shall conform to §704-404 to
the extent applicable.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (4) provides that the burden of proof with respect
to the issue of present danger is on the government and that proof shall be by
a preponderance of the evidence.  This section is consistent with the burden
the government must bear under §704-415 with respect to applications for
discharge, conditional release, or modification of conditions of release.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law, which provided &quot;that upon
presentment of due proof that... [the defendant] has regained his sanity at the
time of acquittal, the judge may release such person without... commital
[sic],&quot;[3] fell short of the flexibility and safeguards provided in the
Code.  By making dangerousness the relevant criterion, the Code provides for
possible commitment of a dangerous person even though the person's physical or
mental condition at the time of commitment does not preclude penal
responsibility.  Furthermore, the Code specifically provides that the court,
the prosecution, or the defendant may move for a separate post-acquittal
hearing directed to the limited issue of present dangerousness.  Consistent
with the concept of tailoring the disposition of the irresponsible defendant to
the condition of the defendant and the protection of others, the Code also
recognizes conditional release (in addition to commitment and discharge) and
provides for physical as well as mental conditions which preclude
responsibility.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §704-411</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 54, Session Laws 1974, amended subsection (3) to permit
the use of a certified clinical psychologist as a member of the examination
panel.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 3, Session Laws 1979, amended subsection (3) by modifying
the requirements for the composition of examination panels to allow the courts
greater flexibility in appointing mental health professionals.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 281, Session Laws 1983, amended subsection (1)(a) so that
defendants charged with nonviolent crimes who are acquitted pursuant to chapter
704, may be placed in the least restrictive environment which takes into
account the defendant's treatment needs and the need to prevent harm to the
defendant and others. Also, subsections (1) and (2) were amended to delete a
person's &quot;danger to property&quot; as a criteria justifying commitment,
based on Suzuki v. Yuen, 617 F.2d 173 (9th Cir. 1980), in which the court found
that criteria unconstitutionally broad.  House Conference Committee Report No.
27.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 314, Session Laws 1986, amended &quot;certified clinical
psychologists&quot; to &quot;licensed psychologists&quot;.  This change was
made because psychologists are licensed and not certified and the term
&quot;clinical&quot; does not accurately describe psychologists qualified to
determine penal responsibility and fitness to proceed.  Act 314 also provided
an exception to the licensure requirement which recognizes that under
§465-3(4), psychologists employed under government certification or civil
service rules are exempt from the licensure requirement.  Conference Committee
Report No. 51-86.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 145, Session Laws 1987, permitted the department of
health to set minimum standards for participation and appointment of a sanity
examiner.  The legislature felt this change would allow additional assurances
of higher quality testimony by these examiners.  Senate Standing Committee
Report No. 691, House Standing Committee Report No. 1217.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 305, Session Laws 1988, included licensed psychologists
among the professionals which may provide offender examination services to the Hawaii criminal justice system.  The legislature stated that the present laws, which permit
only psychiatric evaluation, are inconsistent with the many and varied uses the
court has found for the services of licensed psychologists.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 2153.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 88, Session Laws 1992, made technical amendments to the
section for purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 2579.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 306, Session Laws 1997, amended subsection (3) by, inter
alia, allowing mental health examinations to be conducted by one rather than
three examiners in nonfelony cases; the courts are allowed to appoint either a
psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist as the examiner.  In felony cases,
three examiners are required, including at least one psychiatrist and one
psychologist.  The Act also limited the time period during which a defendant,
if not then confined, may be committed by the court for examination, to not
more than thirty days unless the court determines it necessary upon written
findings.  The amendment streamlines the process for committing and releasing
mentally incompetent defendants.  Conference Committee Report No. 64.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among
other things, require that in a post-acquittal hearing, a defendant's fitness
shall not be an issue for a defendant who has been acquitted on the grounds of
physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect.  House Standing Committee
Report No. 665-06.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Prosecutor's comment that defendant, whose defense was
insanity, would &quot;walk the streets&quot; if acquitted was improper.  58 H.

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant failed to follow the procedural mechanisms
set forth in this section by failing to request a post-acquittal hearing to
address the issue of dangerousness in a proceeding separate from the trial
proceedings, supreme court lacked appellate jurisdiction to review trial
court's decision.  102 H. 130, 73 P.3d 668.</p>
