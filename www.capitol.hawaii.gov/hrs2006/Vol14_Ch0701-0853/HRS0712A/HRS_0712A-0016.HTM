<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §712A-16</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 197, Session Laws 1990, amended this section to require
the attorney general to prepare a report to the legislature on the use of the
Hawaii omnibus criminal forfeiture act.  The legislature felt it was important
to be kept well informed about the use of this powerful tool.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 2900.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 112, Session Laws 1992, amended this section to provide
that the holder of the immediate reversionary interest in leasehold real
property forfeited to the State under chapter 712A is to be offered the first
opportunity to acquire the remaining leasehold interest and any improvements on
the property built or paid for by the lessee.  The legislature felt that this
amendment adequately protects the rights of innocent property owners and other
interest holders while facilitating the disposition of forfeited leasehold
properties.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2482.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 249, Session Laws 2000, amended this section by adding to
the list of property which the attorney general is authorized to sell or
destroy under subsection (1)(c) any untaxed cigarettes forfeited to the State
and transferred to the attorney general for violating the cigarette tax and
tobacco tax law under chapter 245.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 94, Session Laws 2002, by making the cigarette tax stamp
law permanent, amended this and other sections.  The legislature sought to
ensure compliance with and enforcement of the cigarette tax stamp laws.  House
Standing Committee Report No. 502-02.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 63, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by providing
that the drug nuisance abatement unit expenses be paid out of the criminal
forfeiture fund in the department of the attorney general.  Conference
Committee Report No. 31.</p>
