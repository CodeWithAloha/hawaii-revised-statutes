<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §712-1250.5</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 122, Session Laws 1984, added the new offense of
promoting intoxicating liquor to a minor which prohibits persons from giving
liquor to a minor, or allowing a minor to possess intoxicating liquor on
property under that person's control.  The legislature believed that the
passage of this act would reduce the number of drunk drivers and deaths
resulting from drunk driving.  Senate Conference Report No. 40.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 207, Session Laws 1992, removed the repeal date of Act
342, Session Laws of Hawaii 1986, to permanently raise the minimum drinking age
to twenty-one.  Conference Committee Report No. 9.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 203, Session Laws 2006, clarified that individuals who
promote liquor to minors are persons who knowingly sell, offer for sale,
influence the sale, serve, deliver, or give intoxicating liquor to a person
under the age of twenty-one.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1127-06.</p>
