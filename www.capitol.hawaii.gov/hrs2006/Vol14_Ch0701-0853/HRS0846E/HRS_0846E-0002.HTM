<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§846E-2</b>  <b>Registration requirements.</b> 
(a)  A covered offender shall register with the attorney general and comply
with the provisions of this chapter for life or for a shorter period of time as
provided in this chapter.  A covered offender who is not:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  An aggravated sex offender;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A repeat covered offender; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A sexually violent predator,</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>shall be eligible to petition the court in a civil
proceeding for an order that the covered offender's registration requirements
under this chapter be terminated, as provided in section 846E-10.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Each provision of this chapter applicable
to sex offenders shall also be applicable to offenders against minors, unless
offenders against minors are specifically excluded.  Whenever a covered
offender's public information is made publicly accessible, separate registries
shall be maintained for:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Sex offenders; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Offenders against minors.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Registration information for each covered
offender shall consist of a recent photograph, verified fingerprints, and a
signed statement by the covered offender containing:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The name, all prior names, and all aliases used
by the covered offender or under which the covered offender has been known and
other identifying information, including date of birth, social security number,
sex, race, height, weight, and hair and eye color;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The actual address and telephone number of the
covered offender's residence or mailing address, or any current, temporary
address where the covered offender resides, and for each address how long the
covered offender has resided there;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The actual address and telephone number where the
covered offender is staying for a period of more than ten days, if other than
the stated residence;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  If known, the future address and telephone number
where the covered offender is planning to reside, if other than the stated
residence;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Names and, if known, actual business addresses of
current and known future employers and the starting and ending dates of any
such employment;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Names and actual addresses of current and known
future educational institutions with which the covered offender is affiliated
in any way, whether or not compensated, including but not limited to
affiliation as a faculty member, an employee, or a student, and the starting
and ending dates of any such affiliation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  The year, make, model, color, and license number
of all vehicles currently owned or operated by the covered offender;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  A statement listing all covered offenses for
which the covered offender has been convicted or found unfit to proceed or
acquitted pursuant to chapter 704;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  A statement indicating whether the covered
offender has received or is currently receiving treatment ordered by a court of
competent jurisdiction or by the Hawaii paroling authority;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  A statement indicating whether the covered
offender is a United States citizen; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  Any additional identifying information about the
covered offender.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Whenever a covered offender provides
registration information, during initial registration as a covered offender or
when providing notice of a change in registration information, the covered
offender also shall sign a statement verifying that all of the registration
information is accurate and current.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In addition to the requirement under
subsection (a) to register with the attorney general and comply with the
provisions of this chapter until a court relieves the covered offender of the
registration requirements of this chapter, each covered offender shall also
register in person with the chief of police where the covered offender resides
or is present.  Registration under this subsection is for the purpose of
providing the covered offender's photograph, fingerprints, and registration
information.  Registration under this subsection is required whenever the
covered offender, whether or not a resident of this State, remains in this
State for more than ten days or for an aggregate period exceeding thirty days
in one calendar year.  Covered offenders required to register in person with
the chief of police under this subsection shall register no later than three
working days after the earliest of:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Arrival in this State;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Release from incarceration;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Release from commitment;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Release on furlough;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Conviction for a covered offense, unless
incarcerated;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Release on probation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Placement on parole; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Arrival in a county in which the covered offender
resides or expects to be present for a period exceeding ten days.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>In addition to any other requirement to register
under this subsection or subsection (a), each covered offender shall report in
person every five years to the chief of police where the covered offender
resides for purposes of having a new photograph taken.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The registration provisions of this section
shall apply to all covered offenders without regard to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The date of the covered offender's conviction;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The date of finding, pursuant to chapter 704, of
the covered offender's unfitness to proceed; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The date of the covered offender's acquittal due
to mental disease, disorder, or defect, pursuant to chapter 704.  [L 1997, c
316, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 194, §2; am L 2002, c 234, §1; am L 2003, c 62, §4;
am L 2004, c 59, §2; am L 2005, c 45, §4; am L 2006, c 106, §2]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not
interfere with any of a sex offender's protected liberty interests, the
protections of procedural due process are not triggered.  97 H. 285, 36 P.3d
1255.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The lifetime registration component of the Hawaii sex
offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under the
Hawaii constitution, article I, §5 and requires that minimum requirements of
due process--notice and opportunity to be heard--be afforded to convicted sex
offenders; such a proceeding may be instituted by a sex offender in a special
proceeding.  105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242.</p>
