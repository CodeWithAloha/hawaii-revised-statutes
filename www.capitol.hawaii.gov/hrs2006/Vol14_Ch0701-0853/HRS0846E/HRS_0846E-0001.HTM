<p class=XNotesHeading>Revision Note</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;May 9, 2005,&quot; substituted for &quot;the effective
date of this Act&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Indecent exposure, in violation of §707-734, does not
constitute an offense that entails &quot;criminal sexual conduct&quot; and,
consequently, persons convicted of indecent exposure are not &quot;sex
offenders&quot; for purposes of this chapter; thus, defendant was not required
to register as a &quot;sex offender&quot; pursuant to this chapter.  102 H.
383, 76 P.3d 935.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under article I, §5, of the Hawaii constitution, due process
requires that a convicted sex offender under this section be afforded the right
to a judicial hearing at which evidence may be offered to demonstrate that
continuance of all or part of the lifetime registration requirements are not
necessary in a particular case to fulfill the public need to which the sex
offender act responded.  105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242.</p>
