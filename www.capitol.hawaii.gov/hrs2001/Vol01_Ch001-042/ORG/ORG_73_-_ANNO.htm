<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">General Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  The amendments of July&nbsp;9, 1921, are part of the "Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920," the homes commission proper part of which is set forth in full hereinafter, following the Organic Act.  See Joint Resolution of Annexation and the note thereto, RLH 1955, page 13, in regard to the cession of public lands to the United States, their status, disposition thereof, application of the proceeds thereof, and grants of franchises, between annexation and the establishment of territorial government; see Chronological Note of Acts Affecting Hawaii for Acts of Congress, Presidential proclamations and Executive orders relating to public lands, RLH 1955, page 9ff, see also the note to section 91; also §§75, 89, 91, 95, 97 and 99 of this act on public lands; also laws in this Revision relating to public lands.  As to shores, harbors, etc. see §106.  Quaere, whether the federal statute (29 Stat 618, 8 U.S.C.A. 71-77) relating to disabilities of aliens to hold land in territories in general applies to Hawaii.</P>
<P>  Under this § and §91, the public lands are under the territorial laws, but the President may set aside such as he deems proper for the uses of the United States, 24 Ops. 600.  Lands reserved by Executive order in the Territory for use of War Department may be returned by Executive order when purposes for which they were set aside have been served, 35 Ops. 205.  The Territory may acquire private lands by exchange, and these may then be so set aside by the President:  24 Ops. 600.</P>
<P>  Surplus water rights pass to owner of ili kupono on which lies source, 31 H. 376, aff. 52 F.2d 356.</P>
<P>  The legislature may add to the duties of the commissioner of public lands:  18 H. 490.  Before the amendment of May&nbsp;27, 1910, the commissioner's powers were subject to those of the superintendent of public works in respect of certain classes of lands under §75:  17 H. 540 et seq. (town lots); 18 H. 226, 231 (power of exchange).</P>
<P>  The title of the government to crown lands cannot be questioned by the courts:  18 H. 645.  Quaere, whether continuing the Hawaiian land laws in force until Congress otherwise provides, makes them federal laws so as to permit an appeal to the federal supreme court on the ground that a federal question is involved:  211 U.S. 442.  Leasehold interest in public land may be assessed at value of fee; quaere whether that provision of the tax law was continued in force by this § as part of laws relating to public lands:  23 H. 624.  Provision for reimbursement of homesteader for appraised value of improvements, on forfeiture, was continued in force by this § (before its am.) and legislature cannot appropriate additional amount on theory that appraisement was too low:  25 H. 409.  Likewise legislature cannot appropriate money to reimburse purchaser in part on theory that purchase price was appraised too high:  26 H. 106.  Assignment of mortgage is within inhibition against transfers without written consent of commissioner and governor:  27 H. 4.  A franchise granted by the legislature on the day (July&nbsp;7, 1898) the joint resolution of annexation was passed by Congress, whether ratified or not by this §, is not a federal franchise exempt from territorial taxation:  18 H. 18, 20; 211 U.S. 142, the latter holding also that a franchise granted July&nbsp;7, 1898, was not excluded from the franchises granted between that day and a later date, which were ratified by this §.  See §55 on grants of franchises by the territorial legislature.</P>
<P>  Referred to in 16 H. 245; 21 H. 137; 30 H. 210; 32 H. 310; 40 H. 675.</P>
<P>  See RLH 1955, cc 99 to 99D, 103A.</P>
<P>  Discretionary powers given to commissioner not unlawful delegation.  41 H. 461.</P>
<P>  Land laws of Hawaii, including section 73, will continue as state laws, notwithstanding section 15 of the Admission Act prescribing a cut-off date.  Att. Gen. Op. 61-68.  But laws relating to management and disposition of public lands were repealed by L. 1962, c 32, §3.</P>
