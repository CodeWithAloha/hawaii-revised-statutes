<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§37-33  Funds to which allotment system applies.</B>  Sections 37-31 to 37-42 relating to the allotment system shall apply to all appropriations (including standing, continuing, or annual appropriations and special funds) for all departments and establishments, but shall not apply to refund accounts nor to appropriations for the courts or the legislature nor to payment of unemployment compensation benefits.  In the cases of capital improvements and in other cases where periodical allotments are impracticable, the director of finance may dispense therewith and prescribe such regulations as will insure proper application and encumbering of funds.  Subject to section 37-40, emergency or contingent funds, revolving funds, and trust funds, shall be subject to such regulations as the director may prescribe for controlling the expenditures and encumbering the funds. [L Sp 1959 1st, c 12, pt of §3; Supp, §35-21; HRS §37-33]</P>
