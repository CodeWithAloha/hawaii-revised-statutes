<P>&#9;The house of representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment of the governor and lieutenant governor and the senate the sole power to try such impeachments, and no such officer shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of the senate.  When sitting for that purpose, the members of the senate shall be on oath or affirmation and the chief justice shall preside.  Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the legislature may provide for the manner and procedure of removal by impeachment of such officers.</P>
