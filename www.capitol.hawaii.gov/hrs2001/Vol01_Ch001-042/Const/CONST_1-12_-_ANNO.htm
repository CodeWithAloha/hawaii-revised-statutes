<P>  A proposal of the 1978 Constitutional Convention deleted the former section 12, which read:  "No person shall be disqualified to serve as a juror because of sex."  This deletion appears to be one of the unspecified changes submitted  for ratification under Question 34.  On whether any of the changes submitted under Question 34 was in fact approved by the electorate, see Kahalekai v. Doi, 60 H. 324 (1979), excerpted in the note preceding the Preamble to the Constitution.</P>
