<P>&#9;If the governor fails to make any appointment within thirty days of presentation, or within ten days of the senate's rejection of any previous appointment, the appointment shall be made by the judicial selection commission from the list with the consent of the senate.  If the senate fails to reject any appointment within thirty days thereof, it shall be deemed to have given its consent to such appointment.  If the senate shall reject any appointment, the governor shall make another appointment from the list within ten days thereof.
