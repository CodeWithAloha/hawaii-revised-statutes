<P>&#9;The commission may establish a working relationship with a democratically-elected Hawaiian homestead community self-governance organization to promote community welfare.  The selection of authorities to be delegated shall be left to the Hawaiian homes commission's discretion.  The commission may establish criteria to determine the boundaries and location of a Hawaiian homestead community and whether a Hawaiian homestead community organization is eligible for delegation.  Criteria for eligibility shall include but not be limited to the following:</P><DIR>
