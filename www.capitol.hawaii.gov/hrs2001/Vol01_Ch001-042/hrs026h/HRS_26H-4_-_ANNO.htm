<P>  <B>Regulatory programs for professions and occupations that were subject to assessment and repeal under prior law.</B>  Prior to 1994, this section contained references to many regulatory chapters and sections scheduled for assessment and repeal.  This information was noted in the main volumes at the specific profession or occupation chapter or section affected as "subject to reassessment, this chapter is repealed effective (date of scheduled repeal)".  L 1994, c 279, §3 amended this section by removing all of the chapters, sections, and repeal dates rendering the main volume notes obsolete.</P>
