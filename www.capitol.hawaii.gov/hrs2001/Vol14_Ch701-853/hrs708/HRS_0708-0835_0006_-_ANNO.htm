</B>
<P>  Act 277, Session Laws 2001, added this section to create a criminal offense of telemarketing fraud, involving use at least in part of a telephone and direct or implied claims of receiving anything of value or of recovering losses from a prize promotion.  Act 277 also provides for forfeiture of property used in the commission of the crime.</P>
<P>  The legislature found telemarketing fraud to be one of the fastest growing forms of fraud in the United States.  Telemarketers often target older citizens, knowing many of them have significant assets from a lifetime of saving.  Act 277 is part of a larger effort to combat this serious crime and to protect consumers from unscrupulous practices.  Act 277 allows Hawaii to increase its efforts and provide greater protection to its citizens from unscrupulous telemarketing practices.
