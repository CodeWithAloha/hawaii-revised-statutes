</B>
<P>  This section was added by Act 63, Session Laws 1973, "to provide an incentive to a person who rents a motor vehicle to return it to its lawful owner."  House Standing Committee Report No. 821. </P>
<P>  The Committee Report further states that "rental agencies have been plagued for a number of years with overdue and abandoned vehicles.  Presently, there is no legal means available to compel a person to return the vehicle when it is overdue.  This proposed bill would make it a misdemeanor if a person intentionally fails to return a rental motor vehicle."</P>
