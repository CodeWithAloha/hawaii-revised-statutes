<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENTARY ON §701-108</P>
</B>
<P>  Several important policies underlie the proposed statute of limitations.  The most persuasive is the fact that after a certain time, evidence tending to prove or disprove criminal liability becomes stale.  Witnesses die, move away, or forget; physical evidence disintegrates, and it becomes impossible to ascertain what actually happened.  Statutes of limitations may also be viewed as statutes of repose.  Even a person who has committed a penal act is entitled, after the passage of some time, to conduct the person's affairs on the assumption that they will not be disrupted by a prosecution.  This is particularly true in the case of someone who has ceased to engage in penal activity and is leading a law-abiding life.  These policies explain why, even when a time limitation is extended by one of the provisions in this section, an upper limit is set.</P>
<P>  Subsection (1) follows previous Hawaii law in providing no time limitation on murder.[1]  Here, the community's justifiable desire to require the murderer to pay for the murderer's act outweighs the policies discussed above.</P>
<P>  Subsection (2) represents a change in the prior law.  The limitation period was two years, but there were many statutory exceptions:</P>
<P>No person shall be prosecuted for any offense under the laws of the State, except murder in the first and second degrees, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to ravish, carnal abuse of a minor under the age of twelve years, kidnapping, arson in the first and second degrees, burglary in the first and second degrees, forgery, robbery in the first and second degrees, larceny in the first degree, giving, promising or receiving a bribe, extortion in the first and second degrees, compounding an offense punishable by imprisonment for life, and embezzlement, unless the prosecution for the offense is commenced within two years next after the commission thereof.  Nothing herein contained shall bar any prosecution against any person who flees from justice, or absents himself from the State, or so secretes himself that he cannot be found by the officers of the law, so that process cannot be served upon him.[2]</P>
<P>In accord with the policies articulated above, subsection (2) sets more realistic time limitations than prior law.  For the most serious class of felonies, other than murder, a six-year period is set, while for the other classes of felonies, three years is deemed sufficient.  Consistent with prior law, a two- year period is set for misdemeanors.  Prosecution for petty misdemeanors and violations must be commenced within one year.</P>
<P>  Subsection (3) seeks to identify situations in which the statute of limitations ought to be tolled.  In the cases of fraud, breach of fiduciary obligation, and misconduct in public office, the difficulties of detecting the offense suggest that an extension of the normal time is required.  Thus, in the case of fraud and breach of fiduciary obligation, a prosecution may be commenced within one year after discovery, and a prosecution for offenses relating to misconduct in office may be commenced at any time when the defendant is in public office, or within two years thereafter.  In both cases, however, the applicable time limitation may not be extended by more than three years.</P>
<P>  Subsection (4) defines the time at which an offense is to be considered as committed, and subsection (5) defines the time at which a prosecution is commenced.  Subsection (6) tolls the statute of limitations for the period when the accused is continuously absent from the State or has no reasonably ascertainable place of abode therein.  This continues the previous law.  Note, however, that again the time period may not be extended by more than three years.  This seems fair in light of procedures available for extradition.  Subsection (6) also declares that the statute of limitations does not run during any time when a prosecution based on the same conduct is pending against the accused.  This prevents any claim that the statute has run preventing retrial after reversal on appeal or dismissal for some reason which would not make retrial a matter of double jeopardy.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §701-108</P>
</B>
<P>  Act 93, Session Laws 1974, amended subsection (2)(c) to include within the two-year time limitation period the commencement of a prosecution for a parking violation.</P>
<P>  Act 28, Session Laws 1982, deleted from subsection (2), the reference to §707-740, a section repealed by Act 213, Session Laws 1981.</P>
<P>  Act 63, Session Laws 1983, amended subsection (5) to allow prosecution to commence by the filing of a complaint, thereby conforming the section to the 1982 amendment to Article I, Section 10 of the Hawaii State Constitution and to the procedure adopted by the state supreme court, which made the complaint the charging document following a preliminary hearing.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 349, House Standing Committee Report No. 757.</P>
<P>  Act 296, Session Laws 1986, increased the limitations period from one to two years after discovery for offenses involving fraud or breach of fiduciary duty.  Those cases are difficult to prosecute because misleading or fraudulent bookkeeping and records often hide criminal wrongdoing.  The extended limitations period allows authorities more time to collect and analyze those records and documents to determine the nature and extent of criminal activity.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1084-86.</P>
<P>  Act 181, Session Laws 1987, added language to this section to reflect the recently created statutory murder and attempted murder crimes.  These crimes are murder in the first and second degree and attempted murder in the first and second degree.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1130.</P>
<P>  Act 186, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to provide for a nonvehicular manslaughter limitations period of ten years.  Conference Committee Report No. 67.</P>
<P>  Act 171, Session Laws 1995, amended subsection (6) to toll the statute of limitations for bringing a prosecution regarding sexual offenses or child abuse during the time the victim is alive and less than eighteen years of age.  The extension of the statute of limitations recognized that child victims may be unable to report crimes to law enforcement within the existing statute of limitations time period.  House Standing Committee Report No. 693, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1205.</P>
<P>  Act 148, Session Laws 1996, increased the limitations period for offenses involving fraud or a breach of fiduciary obligation from two to three years after discovery of the offense.  The legislature recognized that these complex crimes can take years to uncover, investigate and prove, and can involve numerous victims and large losses.  The Act also clarified language relating to the extension of the statute of limitations for offenses involving fraud or a breach of fiduciary obligation, offenses based on misconduct in office by a public officer or employee, and cases in which the accused is continuously absent from the State or has no reasonably ascertainable place of abode or work within the State, by stating that the extensions shall begin from the expiration of the period of limitation prescribed in subsection (2).  House Standing Committee Report No. 1015-96, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2030.</P>
<P>  Act 149, Session Laws 1997, amended subsection (1) to include criminal conspiracy to commit murder and criminal solicitation to commit murder as offenses for which prosecution may be commenced at any time.  The legislature found that the offense of murder warranted punishment under the Code sufficient to fit the grave consequences of the crime, and that persons found guilty of conspiracy or solicitation to commit murder should also be penalized to a similarly serious degree.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1600.</P>
<P>  Act 33, Session Laws 2001, strengthened the State's computer crime laws by, among other things, setting the statute of limitations for [felony] computer-related crimes to within five years after the crime was committed.  The legislature found that society was adopting at a rapid pace, computer technology to conduct activities of daily living.  Computer technology was being utilized not only for purposes of business and recreation, but also for criminal activity.  Thus, computer-related criminal activity was on the rise as society's dependence on computers increased.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1508.</P>
