</B>
<P>  Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended §711-1109 to provide that depriving pet animals of necessary sustenance constitutes the crime of cruelty to animals.  The legislature noted that the statute identified only those acts which were the most heinous and extreme, such as beating, mutilation, poisoning, starvation, and torture.  However, on a daily basis, other less overt acts such as daily neglect also resulted in the inhumane treatment of animals.  Thus, the legislature agreed that pet animals deserved a minimum level of care including adequate food, water, and shelter.
