</B>
<P>  Act 159, Session Laws 1995, added this section to provide for a class C felony offense of aggravated harassment by stalking.  The legislature found that a stalker's behavior frequently is characterized by a series of acts directed at the same victim that are progressively more serious in nature.  Thus, the legislature believed it necessary to provide enhanced penalties in those cases to deter that type of behavior and to protect the public safety.  Conference Committee Report No. 77.</P>
