</B>
<P>  The Code as adopted added Items (5) and (6).  The Proposed Draft did not contain these items.</P>
<P>  Act 192, Session Laws 1986, amended the definition of "animal" to exclude human beings, thereby foreclosing the possible interpretation of the statute to include within the offense persons engaged in boxing.  House Conference Committee Report No. 37-86, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 27-86, and House Standing Committee Report No. 392.</P>
<P>  Act 292, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding the definition of "facsimile" to strengthen the laws against harassment.  Conference Committee Report No. 57.</P>
<P>  Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended this section by adding the definitions of "pet animal" and "necessary sustenance".  Act 173 protected pet animals in Hawaii from neglect by defining minimum standards of care.  The legislature found that pet animals deserved at least the minimum care of food, water, and protection from the elements.  Act 173 established guidelines to be used to prevent the neglect and abuse of pet animals.  Conference Committee Report No. 87.</P>
