</B>
<P>  Act 278, Session Laws 1999, added this section to make it a felony to take sexual photographs or videotapes of a person without that person's consent and when the person expects privacy.  The legislature found that current laws criminalizing a violation of privacy do not distinguish between surreptitious recording of any events and sounds in a private place, and the more egregious offense of installing a hidden device to surreptitiously record or observe persons while they are undressed or engaging in sexual activity.  The legislature believed that using a hidden device to record someone while engaged in very personal acts merits a higher penalty than simply using a hidden device to record any events in a private place.
