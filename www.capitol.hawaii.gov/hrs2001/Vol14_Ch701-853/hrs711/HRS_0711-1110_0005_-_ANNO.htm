</B>
<P>  Act 262, Session Laws 1985, requires the defendant convicted of cruelty to animals to surrender:  (1) the animal whose abuse led to the conviction; and (2) any other animal if there is evidence of its abuse or neglect.  The Legislature felt that a court- ordered hiatus in the custody of the abused animal would accomplish the clear intent of this measure to protect abused animals from further harm.
