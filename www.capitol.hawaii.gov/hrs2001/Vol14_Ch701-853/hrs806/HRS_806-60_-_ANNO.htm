<P>  Proposed amendment to section did not require constitutional amendment because jury comprised of six members in cases involving non-serious crimes tracked language of §14 of article I of state constitution; however, definition of "serious crimes" as exclusively crimes for which the defendant faces possibility of imprisonment of at least six months, was inconsistent with the principle that crimes that do not carry the possibility of this specific term of imprisonment may nonetheless constitute "serious crimes" which trigger constitutional right to jury trial.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-2.</P>
