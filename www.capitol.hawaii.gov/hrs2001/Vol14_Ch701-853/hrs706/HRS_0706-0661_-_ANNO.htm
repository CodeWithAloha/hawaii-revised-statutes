<P>  As §706-600 and this section do not authorize a court to impose a single sentence on a defendant who has been convicted of multiple charges, trial court did not violate plea agreement by  imposing a life term for each class A felony defendant was convicted of, and then running each life term concurrently.  91 H. 20, 979 P.2d 1046.</P>
