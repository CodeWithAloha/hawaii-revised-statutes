</B>
<P>  Act 338, Session Laws 1993, added this section to authorize the department of public safety to implement a rigorous offender program based on regimental discipline.  The legislature, which is concerned with the problem of prison overcrowding, found that the program established by this section is a viable alternative to incarceration for first-time offenders, who are more likely to respond to rehabilitative efforts.  Conference Committee Report No. 212.</P>
