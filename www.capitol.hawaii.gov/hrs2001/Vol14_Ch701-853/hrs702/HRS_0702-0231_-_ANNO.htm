</B>
<P>  A narrow defense is provided in this section for the defendant who claims that the defendant's conduct resulted not from the defendant's own culpability but rather from coercion exercised upon the defendant by a third party.  It cannot be said that the defendant's conduct is not "voluntary" as that term is used in the penal law, because the defendant's conduct does result from the defendant's conscious determination.  Rather, the basis for permitting the defense is the rationale that the penal law ought not to condemn that which most persons would do in similar circumstances.</P>
<P>  The defendant is afforded by this section an affirmative defense if the defendant engaged in the conduct or caused the result alleged because of the use or threatened use of unlawful force against the defendant or another and a person of reasonable firmness would have been unable to resist such duress.  Although the "reasonable man" standard is employed in a limited manner, the Code has not invoked a negligence standard for penal liability in all cases of duress.  The conscious decision to yield in a duress situation is distinguishable from the inadvertent disregard of unknown risks in the case of negligence.</P>
<P>  Subsection (2) makes the defense unavailable if the defendant was culpable in placing the defendant in the position where the defendant would be subject to duress.</P>
<P>  Subsection (3) abolishes the common-law presumption of coercion when a woman commits an offense under the direction of her husband.  The defense is still available to the wife provided she can raise and prove the issue by evidence.</P>
<P>  The prior law on this subject, H.R.S. §703-5 (as compiled prior to this Code), provided that a defendant will not be regarded as responsible for an act "to the doing of which he is compelled by force which he cannot resist, or from which he cannot escape" if the threatened or imminent danger is greater than that inflicted by the defendant.  (Emphasis added.)</P>

<P>  Act 183, Session Laws 1979, added subsection (5) which expressly categorizes duress as an affirmative defense.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 883 states:</P>
<P>If any class of defenses deserves the title of "affirmative," it is those defenses that admit the commission of the act charged with the necessary mental element, but seek to interpose the existence of facts that, if true, would provide a complete exculpation.  The traditional defenses of duress, necessity and self-defense are common examples.  Unless one is willing to draw the concepts of volitional act and mental element quite broadly, these defenses do not negate either concept.  In that respect they are analogous to the common law of confession and avoidance; they admit the truth of the facts pleaded but offer an excuse.  36 Ohio State Law Journal 828 at 840-41.</P>

<P>  The choice of evils defense under §703-302 and the duress defense under this section are not, as a matter of statutory law, inconsistent.  93 H. 399 (App.), 4 P.3d 533.</P>
