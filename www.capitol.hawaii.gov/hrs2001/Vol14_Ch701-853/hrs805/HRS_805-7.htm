The judge shall reduce to writing the substance of the evidence adduced, with the names of the witnesses.  If in the judge's opinion the testimony does not warrant commitment for trial, the judge shall release the prisoner, noting that fact upon the judge's docket.  But if in the judge's opinion there is probable cause to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense with which the accused is charged, the judge shall make out and deliver to a police officer a mittimus which may be in the form established by the usage and practice of the issuing court.
