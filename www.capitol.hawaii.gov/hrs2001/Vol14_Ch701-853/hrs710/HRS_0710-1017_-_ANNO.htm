</B>
<P>  This section is intended to penalize conduct which undermines confidence in the accuracy of public records.  The accuracy of public records is essential to efficient public administration and, beyond the immediate context of public administration, the government has an interest in protecting public confidence in its records. </P>
<P>  This section does not require that the misuse of the public record be with intent to defraud another, i.e., to injure an interest which has value, as do the sections on forgery.  Nor does this section require that the information made part of the public record, or offered for recordation, registration, or filing, be under oath or sworn to, as do the sections on perjury and related offenses.  Those offenses, however, do complement the offense of tampering with public records, but they deal directly, and in a more precise context, with the aggravated circumstances presented. </P>
<P>  This section is also addressed to the problem of access to public records.  Obviously, acts of destruction and concealment impair the efficiency of public administration.  Subsection (1)(d)(i) is intended primarily to cover acts of destruction, concealment, or impairment by individuals vis-a-vis the government, whereas subsection (1)(d)(ii) is intended primarily to cover the situation where a public servant refuses to surrender records to another public servant when the public servant has the duty to do so.  Both clauses of this subsection are, however, worded broadly in order to cover acts of destruction, concealment, or retention outside their areas of immediate concern.</P>
<P>  Subsection (2) is intended to be inclusive and to cover not only records traditionally considered "public" but also information kept for the benefit of the government, such as medical prescription records.</P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law on tampering with public records is similar to the code,[1] however the Code covers acts of tampering not covered under prior law, clarifies the acts that are covered, and dispenses with the former, archaic requirement of "malice" as it relates to this offense.</P>
