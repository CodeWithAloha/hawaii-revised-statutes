</B>
<P>  At common law, no conviction for perjury could be based upon two contradictory sworn statements, even where one of them was obviously intentionally false, unless the prosecution could prove which was the false statement.[1]  The common-law rule has suffered much criticism for its apparent logical inconsistency.[2]  Moreover, many recent code revisions have rejected the common-law rule.[3] </P>
<P>  Accordingly, the Code adopts §710-1065, allowing prosecution on the basis of the inconsistent statements alone, provided that the requisite circumstances and culpability are also proved.  The unwitting maker of contradictory statements will be protected by the requirement that the attendant circumstances and requisite state of mind be proved with regard to each statement.  Note also that where two contradictory statements carry different sanctions, the declarant may only be convicted of the lesser offense under this section. </P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law contained no specific provisions for inconsistent statements, nor are there any reported Hawaii cases on this point. </P>
