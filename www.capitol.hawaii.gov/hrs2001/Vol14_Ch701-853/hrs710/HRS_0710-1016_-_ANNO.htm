</B>
<P>  The object of this section is to prevent imposition on people by the false pretense of authority. </P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law recognized the offense of false personation of a government officer and imposed a possible maximum sentence of one year's imprisonment or a fine of $100.[1]  The Code authorizes the same imprisonment, but a greater fine, for misdemeanors.  Excluded from Part II are offenses involving falsity which borders on perjury, e.g., false application or consent to marriage, false impersonation before a court.[2]  These problems are dealt with directly in Part VI of this chapter.  Statutory protection for private fraternal organizations, by making unauthorized display of the badge or insignia of the organization a crime, is eliminated.[3]  Also eliminated is the questionable distinction between the penalty which attaches to the unauthorized wearing of a police officer's uniform or badge and that which attaches to the unauthorized wearing of a uniform or badge which resembles a police officer's.[4]  Both situations are covered equally under this section provided other requirements are met. </P>
