</B>
<P>  This section is aimed at persons who aid others to accomplish the unlawful objects of their crimes, for example, by safeguarding the proceeds thereof or converting the proceeds into a negotiable form.  The actor need not have the intent to hinder prosecution required under §§710-1029 and 1030.  As the Model Penal Code commentary points out, there would be "a certain artificiality in proceeding on the theory of obstruction of justice [by hindering prosecution] against one who has really linked himself to the principal offense, and whose interest in frustrating detection is bound to be as much for himself as others."[1] </P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law was more limited than the Code and dealt only with receiving stolen goods.[2]  The Code deals with all acts of securing the proceeds of an offense. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1018</P>
</B>
<P>  Act 149, Session Laws 1997, amended this section to provide that securing the proceeds of an offense is a class C felony if the person assisted, committed murder of any degree.</P>
<P>  The legislature found that the offense of murder warrants punishment that is sufficient to fit the grave consequences of the crime.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1600.</P>
