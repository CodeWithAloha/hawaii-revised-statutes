</B>
<P>  Subsection (1)(a) of this section is intended to place obligations upon the citizen in aiding fire control similar to those which §710-1011 places upon the citizen with regard to law enforcement.  Again, the request for aid need not be obeyed unless it is reasonable under the circumstances.</P>
<P>  Subsection (1)(b) is related to the control of crowds and vehicles in the vicinity of a fire, under circumstances where disorderly conduct and riot-dispersal statutes would not apply.</P>
<P>  The waiver of civil liability in subsection (4) is explained in the commentary to §710-1011.</P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law was substantially stricter than the Code in requiring all able-bodied men between 16 and 50 to aid in extinguishing a fire when properly so requested.  The section also imposed liability upon one who refused to lend necessary materials to the control of a fire.  The available penalty upon conviction was a fine of from $10 to $1,000.[1]  The Code more precisely states when aid is expected and what type can be requested.</P>
