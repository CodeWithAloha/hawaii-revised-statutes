<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§651C-4]  Transfers fraudulent as to present and future creditors.</B>  (a)  A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debtor:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(A)&#9;Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or</P>
<P>(B)&#9;Intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that the debtor would incur, debts beyond the debtor's ability to pay as they became due.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  In determining actual intent under subsection (a)(1), consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor was sued or threatened with suit;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The transfer was of substantially all the debtor's assets;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The debtor had absconded;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;The debtor had removed or concealed assets;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;The value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred;</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;The debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred;</P>
<P>    (10)&#9;The transfer had occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and</P>
<P>    (11)&#9;The debtor had transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor who had transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor. [L 1985, c 216, pt of §1]</P>
