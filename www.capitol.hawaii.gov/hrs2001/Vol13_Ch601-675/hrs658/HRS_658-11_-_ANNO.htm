<P>  Limitation provisions.  59 H. 207, 579 P.2d 673.</P>
<P>  Proper to ask for clarification of award after the ten-day period has expired.  72 H. 41, 805 P.2d 455.</P>

<P>  To the extent that an HRCP rule 59(e) motion to reconsider is limited to new evidence that (1) supports a statutory basis already raised in a timely motion to vacate under §658-9 and this section and (2) could not have been raised in a petition to vacate nor could have been discovered, despite due diligence, prior to the expiration of the ten-day period in this section, such a reconsideration motion would not contravene the express notice requirements of this section.  92 H. 505, 993 P.2d 539.</P>
<P>  Where motion for reconsideration raised a new basis for vacating the arbitration award, motion amounted to a motion to amend defendant’s prior motion to vacate after the ten-day period set forth in this section had elapsed, and was therefore untimely.  92 H. 505, 993 P.2d 539.</P>
