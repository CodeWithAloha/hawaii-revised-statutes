<P>  No award can be considered final, despite intention of parties, until court confirmation of award has been obtained.  73 H. 201, 830 P.2d 503.</P>
<P>  Failure to timely bring §§658-9 or 658-10 motion precludes challenge of award confirmation order and subsequent appeal under §658-15, except for clarification; change in amount of award not clarification.  74 H. 210, 847 P.2d 652.</P>
<P>  Trial court erred in a proceeding to confirm an arbitration award under this section when it determined a legal question not decided by the arbitrators and modified the arbitration award; unless the award was subject to review under the statutory grounds set forth in §§658-9 or 658-10, or one of two judicially recognized exceptions, trial court was mandated to confirm the award according to its terms.  94 H. 362, 14 P.3d 1043.</P>
<P>  No requirement exists under this section that an arbitration award be confirmed to be enforceable.  88 H. 209 (App.), 965 P.2d 142.</P>
