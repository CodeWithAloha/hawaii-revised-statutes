<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§658A-18]  Judicial enforcement of pre-award ruling by arbitrator</B>.  If an arbitrator makes a pre-award ruling in favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an award under section 658A-19.  A prevailing party may make a motion to the court for an expedited order to confirm the award under section 658A-22, in which case the court shall summarily decide the motion.  The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, or corrects the award under section 658A-23 or 658A-24. [L 2001, c 265, pt of §1]</P>
