(a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), upon motion of a party to an agreement to arbitrate or to an arbitration proceeding, the court may order consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings as to all or some of the claims if:</P><DIR>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;There are separate agreements to arbitrate or separate arbitration proceedings between the same persons or one of them is a party to a separate agreement to arbitrate or a separate arbitration proceeding with a third person;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The claims subject to the agreements to arbitrate arise in substantial part from the same transaction or series of related transactions;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The existence of a common issue of law or fact creates the possibility of conflicting decisions in the separate arbitration proceedings; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Prejudice resulting from a failure to consolidate is not outweighed by the risk of undue delay or prejudice to the rights of or hardship to parties opposing consolidation.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  The court may order consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings as to some claims and allow other claims to be resolved in separate arbitration proceedings.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The court may not order consolidation of the claims of a party to an agreement to arbitrate if the agreement prohibits consolidation. [L 2001, c 265, pt of §1]</P>
