<P>  Where appellate court's amended order denying reconsideration corrected only clerical errors and did not materially alter rights or obligations, entry of amended order did not extend time within which petitioner was required to file application for certiorari under subsection (c) and Hawaii rules of appellate procedure rule 40.1(a); petitioner's application for certiorari was thus untimely.  94 H. 297, 12 P.3d 1238.</P>
