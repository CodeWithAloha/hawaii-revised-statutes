</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule resembles Fed. R. Evid. 1101 with appropriate modifications.</P>
<P>  Subsections (a) and (b):  The intent is to posit the applicability of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence in all state courts and in all proceedings, except as provided in subsection (d).</P>
<P>  Subsection (c):  There are no exceptions to the privilege rules except as specifically set forth in Article V.</P>
<P>  Subsection (d):  Paragraph (1) simply restates the point made in the last sentence of Rule 104(a), and the matter is treated in the commentary to that rule.  Paragraph (2) follows the lead of Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d)(2) in excepting grand jury proceedings from the requirements of the rules.  There is no intent, however, to disturb rulings such as State v. Layton, 53 H. 513, 497 P.2d 559 (1972), and State v. Joao, 53 H. 226, 491 P.2d 1089 (1971), where the Hawaii Supreme Court has imposed supervisory and due process limitations on the kinds of evidence that can be presented to grand juries.  "Miscellaneous proceedings," exempted in paragraph (3), include "preliminary examination in criminal cases," by which is meant those hearings specified in HRCrP 5(c).  Other pretrial motions and proceedings in criminal and civil cases are not exempted.  The exemption for small claims courts is consistent with Hawaii Rev. Stat. §633-32 (1976).</P>
