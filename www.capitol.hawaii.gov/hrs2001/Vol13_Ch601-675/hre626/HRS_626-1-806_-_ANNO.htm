</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 806 except that the phrase, "or a statement defined in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E)," is omitted as superfluous, inasmuch as these categories of party-opponent admissions are treated in these rules as hearsay exceptions under Rule 803(a) supra.  As the Advisory Committee's Note to Fed. R. Evid. 806 puts it:  "The declarant of a hearsay statement which is admitted in evidence is in effect a witness.  His credibility should in fairness be subject to impeachment and support as though he had in fact testified."</P>
