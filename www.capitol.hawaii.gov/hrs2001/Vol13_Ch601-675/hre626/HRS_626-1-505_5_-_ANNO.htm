</B>
<P>  This rule, which resembles victim-counselor privilege provisions now in existence in some twenty states, e.g., Cal. Evid. Code §§1035 through 1037.7 (1992), encourages and protects the counseling of emotionally distressed victims of violent crimes by according privilege status to confidential communications made in the course of the counseling process.  In adopting a similar law, N.J. Stat. Ann. §2A:84A-22.13 and 22.15 (1991), the New Jersey Legislature declared that the "counseling of victims is most successful when the victims are assured [that] their thoughts and feelings will remain confidential and will not be disclosed without their permission."  The present provision proceeds upon just such a policy basis.</P>
