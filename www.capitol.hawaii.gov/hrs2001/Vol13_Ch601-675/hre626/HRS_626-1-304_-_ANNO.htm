<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 304 COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<B><P>  </B>The criteria established by this rule are modeled upon, and accord generally with, those of Cal. Evid. Code §§660-669, with modifications appropriate to the rules of law of this jurisdiction.</P>
<P>  Subsection (a):  This provision is analogous in purpose to Rule 303(a) supra.  It establishes the general criteria for determination of those presumptions that impose on the adverse party the burden of proof.  The standard of determination of "public policy" in this subsection is identical with that discussed in the comment to Rule 303(a).  The catalogue of presumptions in subsection (c) of this rule, although not exhaustive, is determinative for the presumptions listed and is illustrative of the class of presumptions governed by this rule.</P>
<P>  Subsection (b):  This provision is analogous to Rule 303(b) supra.  Its purpose is to define the effect of the presumptions governed by this rule.  Since the effect is to shift the ultimate burden of proof, the general requirement is proof by "a preponderance of the evidence."  Despite disagreement by some authorities, the most reasonable meaning of this requirement, and the interpretation given it in most jurisdictions, is "proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence," McCormick §339.</P>
<P>  Subsection (c):  The presumptions in this list parallel the traditional common law presumptions incorporated in Cal. Evid. Code §§662-668, with some modifications.</P>
<P>  Although presumption (1) apparently has not been litigated at the appellate level in Hawaii, it is a traditional common law presumption supported by a public policy so compelling as to require clear and convincing proof to overcome it.</P>
<P>  Presumption (2), that official duty has been regularly performed, has been affirmed by the Hawaii Supreme Court, e.g., DeMello v. Wilson, 28 H. 298 (1925); Nichols v. Wah Chong Sun, 28 H. 395 (1925); State v. Hawaiian Dredging Co., 48 H. 152, 397 P.2d 593 (1964); State v. Midkiff, 49 H. 456, 421 P.2d 550 (1966).  The qualification barring extension of the presumption to the lawfulness of arrests or searches conducted without warrants is implicit in search and seizure law, e.g., State v. Barnes, 58 H. 333, 335, 568 P.2d 1207, 1209 (1977):  "[A]n arrest without a warrant will be upheld only where there was probable cause for the arrest." In State v. Kaluna, 55 H. 361, 363, 520 P.2d 51, 55 (1974), the court declared:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>[S]ince it was conducted without a warrant, the search carries an initial presumption of unreasonableness....  To overcome this presumption, the State must show that the facts or the case justified the police in searching without a warrant and that the search itself was no broader than necessary to satisfy the need which legitimitized departure from the warrant requirement in the first place.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>  Presumption (3) finds support in a long line of Hawaii Supreme Court decisions.  In Lord v. Lord, 35 H. 26, 39 (1939), the court said:  "Where a person does an act he is presumed in doing so to have intended the natural consequences thereof."  See also Yuen v. French, 29 H. 625 (1927); Territory v. Palai, 23 H. 133 (1916).  However, consistent with the statutory requirement that every element of a crime charged must be proved, Hawaii Rev. Stat. §701-114 (1976), and that state of mind, when designated by the statute, is an element of the crime, Hawaii Rev. Stat. §702-204 (1976), intent may not be established by presumption in criminal actions.</P>
<P>  Presumption (5) accords with Hawaii Supreme Court decision. In In Re Kawahara Yasutaro, 15 H. 667, 670 (1904), the court said:  "The presumption is in favor of the regularity of the proceedings of courts of record and the burden is placed on one alleging errors therein to show it affirmatively."  In a later decision, State v. Villados, 55 H. 394, 397, 520 P.2d 427, 430 (1974), the court addressed the aspect of presumptive jurisdiction:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>[C]ircuit courts are courts of general jurisdiction in this State, and therefore the presumption is in favor of retention rather than divestiture of jurisdiction.... [B]efore a party can claim that an act or statute has the effect of divesting jurisdiction which has regularly and fully vested, the law in favor of such divestment must be clear and unambiguous.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>  Presumption (6) is established by Hawaii Supreme Court decision.  In Estate of Ah Leong, 34 H. 161, 165 (1937), the court said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>[T]he contention is that upon proof of the celebration of a ceremonial marriage...followed by an actual living together publicly...the law will presume, in the absence of countervailing proof, that all of the prerequisites to a valid marriage...were complied with.</P>
<P>  The rule of law supporting this contention has been so often judicially announced that it may be considered firmly established.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>See also Hawaii Rev. Stat. §572-13(c) (1976), providing that a certified copy of a certificate of marriage is prima facie evidence of the fact of marriage.</P>
<P>  Presumption (7) accords with Hawaii Rev. Stat. §560:1-107(3), and modifies the traditional common law presumption of death after a seven-year period of absence.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Jury instruction that deceased presumed to have exercised due care was superfluous, where defendant had burden of proving deceased was negligent.  6 H. App. 516, 730 P.2d 342.</P>
