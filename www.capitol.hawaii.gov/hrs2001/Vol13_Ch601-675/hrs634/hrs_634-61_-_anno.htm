<P>  Defendant removed action to U.S. district court alleging complete diversity of citizenship based on plaintiff's notice of defendant doctor's death, and argued, inter alia, that under Hawaii law, a decedent is not a proper party to an action; because the time in which to substitute doctor's estate or representative had not yet passed, the action against doctor had not been dismissed; therefore, removal on that basis was premature.  61 F. Supp. 2d 1121.</P>
<P>  Trespass quare clausum abates upon death of plaintiff.  6 H. 556, questioned 45 H. 373, 375, 369 P.2d 96.  Ejectment does not abate by death of sole defendant between verdict and judgment.  10 H. 505.  Counsel for deceased may appear as amicus curiae on motion made prior to death.  Id.  Plaintiff in ejectment having died after verdict and before defendant's bill of exceptions was allowed, plaintiff's heirs could not be substituted on motion in supreme court.  19 H. 385.  Survival of cause of action.  34 H. 667.</P>
<P>  Suit over title to land or over performance of decedent's contract to convey land, heirs as parties.  See 43 H. 241; 44 H. 464, 474, 357 P.2d 110; 45 H. 1, 13, 361 P.2d 374; 49 H. 409, 410, 420 P.2d 93.</P>
<P>  Substitution of party must be made within reasonable time after death of party.  60 H. 125, 588 P.2d 416.</P>
<P>  Appellant’s claim against corporations not abated by involuntary dissolutions, where before default judgment was entered, corporations were involuntarily dissolved.  77 H. 417, 886 P.2d 754.</P>
<P>  As a general rule, an heir of an undistributed estate, who has not been judicially appointed as the personal representative of a decedent's estate, is not a "proper party" for substitution pursuant to HRCP rule 25(a)(1).  89 H. 91, 969 P.2d 1209.</P>
<P>  Defamation action does not survive death of defendant.  1 H. App. 517, 620 P.2d 771.</P>
