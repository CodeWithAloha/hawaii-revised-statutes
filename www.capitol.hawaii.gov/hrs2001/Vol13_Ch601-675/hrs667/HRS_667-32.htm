<P>(G)&#9;The public notice of the public sale was posted on the mortgaged property or on such other real property of which the mortgaged property is a part on <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> (date).  That date was at least sixty days before the date of the public sale;</P>
<P>(H)&#9;Two public showings (open houses) of the mortgaged property were held (or were not held because the mortgagor did not cooperate);</P>
