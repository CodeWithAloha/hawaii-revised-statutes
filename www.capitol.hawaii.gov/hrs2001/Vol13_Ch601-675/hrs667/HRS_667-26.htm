<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§667-26]  Public showing of mortgaged property. </B> (a)  If the default is not cured as stated in the notice of default, the foreclosing mortgagee shall conduct two open houses of the mortgaged property before the public sale; provided that the foreclosing mortgagee timely received the signed letter of agreement from the mortgagor as required by the notice of default.  Only two open houses shall be required even if the date of the public sale is postponed.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Even if the signed letter of agreement is timely received, if there is no subsequent cooperation by the mortgagor to allow two open houses, the public sale may be held without any open houses of the mortgaged property.  If the public notice of the public sale advertised the dates and times of the open houses, but there were no open houses because of the lack of cooperation by the mortgagor, the public sale may still be held as advertised, and the public notice of the public sale may not need to be republished. [L 1998, c 122, pt of §1]</P>
