Benefits shall also be paid from this fund to an employee who is entitled to receive temporary disability benefits but cannot receive such benefits because of the bankruptcy of the employee's employer or because the employee's employer is not in compliance with this chapter.  Benefits paid from the special fund to such employee may be recovered from the employee's bankrupt or noncomplying employer.  The director shall institute administrative and legal actions, as provided in section 392-47, to effect recovery of such benefits.
