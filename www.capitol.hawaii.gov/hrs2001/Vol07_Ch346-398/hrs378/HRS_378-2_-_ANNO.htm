<P>  Monocular pilot applicant’s disability discrimination claim and retaliation claim not preempted by Airline Deregulation Act of 1978; pilot applicant’s success or failure on the discrimination claim had no bearing on pilot applicant’s retaliation claim.  128 F.3d 1301.</P>
<P>  Not unlawful for employer to discharge wife, who along with husband, violated employer's policy by forming own company while still working for employer.  558 F. Supp. 1229.</P>

<P>  Purpose is to protect claimants under workers' compensation law.  749 F. Supp. 1023.</P>
<P>  Because this section and §378-62 did not contain limitation periods, court invoked State’s general personal injury statute of limitations, §657-7; plaintiff’s state law claims barred where neither the collective bargaining proceedings nor the equal employment opportunity commission proceedings tolled the statute of limitations.  874 F. Supp. 1095.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff brought forth evidence of a continuing series of conduct which affected plaintiff and plaintiff's work environment; plaintiff's sexual harassment claims may proceed using the evidence, even though much of it predated limitations period; plaintiff may not rely on other proffered evidence because to extent those actions raised claims, statute of limitations had passed.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1224.</P>
<P>  Violated by company policy requiring termination of person married to someone in same department unless termination falls under exception in §378-3.  72 H. 350, 816 P.2d 302.</P>
<P>  Defendant’s policy prohibiting persons related by blood or marriage from working in the same department, as applied to plaintiff, violated plain language and purpose of this section, unless the termination fell within one of the exceptions in §378-3.  76 H. 454, 879 P.2d 1037.</P>

<P>  Where record contained numerous instances of both physical and verbal conduct of a sexual nature by doctor towards complainant and others, complainant never solicited or incited doctor’s conduct, and conduct had effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work environment, there was sufficient evidence to support commission’s determination that doctor violated paragraph (1)(A) and Hawaii administrative rule §12-46-109(a)(3).  88 H. 10, 960 P.2d 1218.</P>
<P>  Based on definition of  "employer" in §378-1, legislature intended all employers, regardless of size, to be subject to the provisions of this chapter, including paragraph (1)(A).  89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104.</P>
<P>  Employer’s policy of denying any extended leave during employee’s first year of employment violated Hawaii administrative rule §12-46-108, which was adopted to enforce the legislative mandate of paragraph (1)(A) and Hawaii’s constitutional prohibition against sex discrimination in the exercise of a person’s civil rights in employment.  89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff in age discrimination suit did not meet plaintiff's burden of establishing that defendant's articulated reason for taking adverse employment action against plaintiff was pretextual, and plaintiff did not give any other evidence that would give rise to a genuine issue of material fact, trial court properly granted summary judgment.  94 H. 368, 14 P.3d 1049.</P>
<P>  An employee may bring action against employer for intentional infliction of emotional distress caused by discrimination in violation of this section, and this action is not barred by exclusivity provision of §386-5.  87 H. 57 (App.), 951 P.2d 507.</P>
