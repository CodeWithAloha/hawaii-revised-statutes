<P>&#9;<B>[§378-51]  Action against labor organization, limitation.</B>  Any complaint, whether founded upon any contract obligation or for the recovery of damage or injury to persons or property, by an employee against a labor organization for its alleged failure to fairly represent the employee in an action against an employer shall be filed within ninety days after the cause of action accrues, and not thereafter.</P>
<P>&#9;Where the alleged failure to fairly represent an employee arises from a grievance, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue when an employee receives actual notice that a labor organization either refuses or has ceased to represent the employee in a grievance against an employer.  Where the alleged failure is related to negotiations or collective bargaining, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue when the applicable collective bargaining agreement or amendment thereto is executed. [L 1980, c 35, §1]</P>
