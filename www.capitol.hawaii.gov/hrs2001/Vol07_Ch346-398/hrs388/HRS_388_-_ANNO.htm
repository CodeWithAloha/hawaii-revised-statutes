<P>  Chapters 387 and 388 serve to prevent employer from withholding sums or benefits to which employee has rights by virtue of contract with employer, not a predecessor.  661 F.2d 776.</P>
<P>  Chapter establishes clear mandate of public policy to protect at will employee from being discharged for asserting rights accorded employee by its provisions, and does not itself provide sufficient remedy for discharge; no legislative intent to supersede at will employee’s common law remedy for wrongful discharge detected.  10 H. App. 250, 865 P.2d 170.</P>
