<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§371-4  Labor and industrial relations appeals board.</B>  (a)  There is created a labor and industrial relations appeals board composed of three members nominated and, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, appointed by the governor for terms of ten years each, except that the terms of members first appointed shall be for six, eight, and ten years respectively as designated by the governor at the time of appointments.  The governor shall designate the chairperson of the board who shall be an attorney at law licensed to practice in all of the courts of this State.  Each member shall hold office until the member's successor is appointed and qualified.  Because cumulative experience and continuity in office are essential to the proper handling of appeals under workers' compensation law and other labor laws, it is hereby declared to be in the public interest to continue board members in office as long as efficiency is demonstrated.  The members shall devote full time to their duties as members of the board.  Effective January&nbsp;1, 1989, and January&nbsp;1, 1990, the salary of the chairperson of the board shall be set by the governor within the range from $69,748 to $74,608 and $72,886 to $77,966 a year, respectively, and the salary of each of the other members shall be ninety-five per cent of the chairperson's salary.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The board shall have power to decide appeals from decisions and orders of the director of labor and industrial relations issued under the workers' compensation law and any other law for which an appeal to the board is provided by law.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A decision concurred in by any two members shall constitute a decision of the board.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A vacancy in the board, if there remain two members of it, shall not impair the authority of two members to act.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  If any member of the board is unable to act because of absence, temporary disability, or disqualification, the governor may make a temporary appointment and the appointee shall have all the powers and duties of a regular member of the board.</P>
