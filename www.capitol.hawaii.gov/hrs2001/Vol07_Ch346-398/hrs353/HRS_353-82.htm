In this respect, the Hawaii paroling authority and the various circuit judges, in cases under their respective jurisdictions, may, in their discretion require the individual to post bond in an amount believed sufficient to assure coverage of return costs in the event of delinquency or commission of further crime in the receiving state during the period of parole or probation.  The bond shall be held in trust by the state director of finance until application is made by the paroling authority or any circuit judge for its return to the depositor or its surrender to meet expenses for the return of the individual from the receiving state.
