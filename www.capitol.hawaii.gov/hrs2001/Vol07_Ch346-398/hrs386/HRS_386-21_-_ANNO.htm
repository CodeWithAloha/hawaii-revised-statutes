</B>
<P>  Offsets for workers' compensation benefits in pension plan constituted forfeitures under ERISA.  504 F. Supp. 958.</P>
<P>  Workers' compensation benefits clearly intended to indemnify workers for job related injury or disease, not to provide income lost on retirement.  504 F. Supp. 958.</P>
<P>  Voluntary, involuntary medical attendance.  32 H. 503.</P>
<P>  A decision that finally adjudicates the matter of medical and temporary disability benefits under §§386-31(b), 386-32(b), and this section is an appealable final order under §91-14(a), even though the matter of permanent disability benefits under §§386-31(a) and 386-32(a) has been left for later determination.  89 H. 436, 974 P.2d 1026.</P>
<P>  There is no statutory authority granted to board to apportion the medical treatment coverage afforded under this section between a preexisting dental condition and the accident-induced temporomandibular joint disorder; where substantial evidence in record indicated that the medical treatment proposed was necessitated by the nature of the injury, the employer was required to provide compensation for "all" medical treatment required.  93 H. 116 (App.), 997 P.2d 42.</P>
<P>  Cited:  24 H. 731, 733.</P>
