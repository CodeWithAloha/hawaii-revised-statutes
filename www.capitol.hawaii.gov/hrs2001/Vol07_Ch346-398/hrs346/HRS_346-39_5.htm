Prior to the reversion to the program's appropriation from which the funds were expended, the department may use the balance of the household's electronic benefit transfer account to offset any outstanding overpayments still owed by the household.</P>
<P>&#9;For purposes of this section, financial assistance benefits refer to cash payments authorized by the department to be issued through the electronic benefit transfer system.  A financial assistance account shall be considered abandoned when there is no debit transaction to the account for a period of ninety consecutive calendar days.
