<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Minimum requirements be as simple and clear as possible;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Minimum requirements be germane to the provision of care to children in a private home as opposed to a nonresidential facility or institution, require as little recordkeeping by the provider as possible, and require information and reports if deemed necessary, from the provider which the department intends to scrutinize carefully and not cursorily; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Department establish minimum requirements, the compliance with which can be assessed easily and objectively by officers and employees of the department, providers, and parents and legal guardians of children. [L 1985, c 208, pt of §2]</P>
