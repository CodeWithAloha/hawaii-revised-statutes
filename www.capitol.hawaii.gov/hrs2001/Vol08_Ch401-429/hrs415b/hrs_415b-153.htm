<P>&#9;Interrogatories to an officer or director shall be mailed by registered mail to the individual's latest residence address on file in the office of the director.  The interrogatories shall be answered within thirty days after their mailing or within any additional time fixed by the director.  The answers to the interrogatories shall be full and complete, in writing, and under oath.  If the interrogatories are directed to an individual they shall be answered by the individual; and, if directed to a corporation, they shall be answered by its president, vice-president, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer, or assistant treasurer. </P>
<P>&#9;The director need not file any document related to the interrogatories until the interrogatories are answered pursuant to this section, and not then if the answers disclose that the document is not in conformity with this chapter.  The director shall certify to the attorney general, for any action the attorney general deems appropriate, all interrogatories and answers thereto which disclose a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. </P>
<P>&#9;The director, or designated agent, at any time, may call for the production of the books and papers of any domestic or foreign corporation doing business in this State, and examine under oath its officers, members, and any other persons associated with its corporate affairs.
