<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Subject to any restrictions in chapter 415 or the articles of incorporation, the consideration to be paid for the issuance of authorized capital stock of a Hawaii stock financial institution shall be authorized by the board of directors of the financial institution and shall be paid only in money or such other consideration as may be authorized by chapter 415 or this chapter, but not in labor or services actually performed for the financial institution; provided that upon authorization by the board of directors, the financial institution may issue its own authorized shares of capital stock in exchange for or in conversion of its outstanding shares, or distribute its own shares pro rata to its shareholders or the shareholders of one or more classes or series, to effectuate stock dividends or splits, and any such transaction shall not require consideration; provided, further, that no such issuance of shares of any class or series shall be made to the holders of shares of any other class or series unless it is either expressly provided for in the articles of incorporation, or is authorized by the affirmative vote or the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series in which a distribution is to be made.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;No Hawaii financial institution shall issue any share of its capital stock unless and until the full amount of any consideration therefor as authorized by the board of directors shall have been paid into or received by the financial institution.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;No Hawaii stock financial institution other than a nondepository financial services loan company shall issue preferred stock without first obtaining the written approval of the commissioner as to the amount and terms thereof.  While any preferred stock of a financial institution is held as owner or pledgee by any federal agency or entity established by law for the purpose of providing financial assistance to financial institutions, such preferred stock and any dividends paid thereon shall be exempt from taxation by this State.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;No Hawaii stock financial institution other than a nondepository financial services loan company shall decrease its authorized capital stock or the par value of capital stock having par value, or decrease its outstanding capital stock by the acquisition of its own shares, without first receiving the written approval of the commissioner.
