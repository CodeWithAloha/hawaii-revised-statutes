</B><P>  Plaintiff limited partners stood in the position of "third persons", rather than "copartners", for the purposes of determining general partners' liability to them, pursuant to §§425-113 through 425-115 (1993); thus, general partners were jointly and severally liable for any wrongful acts and breach of trust chargeable to the partnership on the basis of the other general partners' tortious misconduct.  95 H. 116, 19 P.3d 699.</P>
