<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§414-313  Action plan.</B>  (a)  After adopting a plan of merger or share exchange, the board of directors of each corporation party to the merger, and the board of directors of the corporation whose shares will be acquired in the share exchange, shall submit the plan of merger (except as provided in subsection (h)) or share exchange for approval by its shareholders.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  For a plan of merger or share exchange to be approved:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The board of directors must recommend the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders, unless the board of directors determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation and communicates the basis for its determination to the shareholders with the plan; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The shareholders entitled to vote must approve the plan.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  The board of directors may condition its submission of the proposed merger or share exchange on any basis.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the proposed shareholders' meeting in accordance with section 414-125.  The notice must also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan of merger or share exchange and contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  With respect to corporations incorporated on or after July 1, 1987, at such a meeting, a vote of the shareholders shall be taken on the proposed plan.  The plan shall be approved upon receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of each class of the shares entitled to vote thereon as a class and of the total shares entitled to vote thereon.  Any class of shares of any such corporation shall be entitled to vote as a class if any such plan contains any provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would entitle that class of shares to vote as a class and, in the case of an exchange, if the class is included in the exchange.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  With respect to corporations incorporated before July 1, 1987, at such meeting, a vote of the shareholders shall be taken on the proposed plan.  The plan shall be approved upon receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of three-fourths of all the issued and outstanding shares of stock having voting power even though their right to vote is otherwise restricted or denied by the articles, bylaws, or resolutions of any such corporation.  The articles of incorporation may be amended by the vote set forth in the preceding sentence to provide for a lesser proportion of shares, or of any class or series thereof, than is provided in the preceding sentence, in which case the articles of incorporation shall control; provided that the lesser proportion shall be not less than the proportion set forth in subsection (e).</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  Separate voting by voting groups is required:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;On a plan of merger if the plan contains a provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by one or more separate voting groups on the proposed amendment under section 414-284; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;On a plan of share exchange by each class or series of shares included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(h)  Action by the shareholders of the surviving corporation on a plan of merger is not required if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation will not differ (except for amendments enumerated in section 414-282) from the articles of incorporation before the merger;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Each shareholder of the surviving corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger will hold the same number of shares, with identical designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights, immediately after the merger;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The number of voting shares outstanding immediately after the merger, plus the number of voting shares issuable as a result of the merger (either by the conversion of securities issued pursuant to the merger or the exercise of rights and warrants issued pursuant to the merger), will not exceed by more than twenty per cent the total number of voting shares of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately before the merger; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The number of participating shares outstanding immediately after the merger, plus the number of participating shares issuable as a result of the merger (either by the conversion of securities issued pursuant to the merger or exercise of rights and warrants issued pursuant to the merger), will not exceed by more than twenty per cent the total number of participating shares outstanding immediately before the merger.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(i)  As used in subsection (h):</P>
<P>&#9;"Participating shares" means shares that entitle their holders to participate without limitations in distributions.</P>
<P>&#9;"Voting shares" means shares that entitle their holders to vote unconditionally in elections of directors.</P>
<P>&#9;(j)  After a merger or share exchange is authorized, and at any time before articles of merger or share exchange are filed, the planned merger or share exchange may be abandoned (subject to any contractual rights), without further shareholder action, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the plan of merger or share exchange or, if none is set forth, in the manner determined by the board of directors.
