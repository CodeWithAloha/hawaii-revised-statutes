The interrogatories shall be answered within thirty days after the mailing thereof, or within such additional time as shall be fixed by the director, and the answers thereto shall be full and complete and shall be made in writing and under oath.  If the interrogatories are directed to an individual, they shall be answered by the individual, and if directed to a corporation, they shall be answered by the president, vice president, secretary, or assistant secretary thereof.  The director need not file any document to which the interrogatories relate until the interrogatories are answered as provided herein, and not then if the answers thereto disclose that the document is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.  The director shall certify to the attorney general, for such action as the attorney general may deem appropriate, all interrogatories and answers thereto which disclose a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.
