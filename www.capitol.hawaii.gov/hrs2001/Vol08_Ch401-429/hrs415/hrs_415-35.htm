<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-35  Board of directors.</B>  (a)  All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under authority of, and the business and affairs of a corporation shall be managed under the direction of, a board of directors except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or the articles of incorporation.  If any such provision is made in the articles of incorporation, the powers and duties conferred or imposed upon the board of directors by this chapter shall be exercised or performed to such extent and by such person or persons as shall be provided in the articles of incorporation.  Directors need not be shareholders of the corporation unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws so require.  The articles of incorporation or bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors.  The board of directors shall have authority to fix the compensation of directors unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  A director shall perform the director's duties as a director, including the director's duties as a member of any committee of the board upon which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, and with such care as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.  In determining the best interests of the corporation, a director, in addition to considering the interests of the corporation's shareholders, may consider, in the director's discretion, any of the following factors:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The interests of the corporation's employees, customers, suppliers and creditors;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The economy of the State and the nation;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Community and societal considerations, including, without limitation, the impact of any action upon the communities in or near which the corporation has offices or operations; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The long-term as well as short-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders, including, without limitation, the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  In performing the director's duties, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;One or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters which the director reasonably believes to be within that person's professional or expert competence; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A committee of the board upon which the director does not serve, duly designated in accordance with a provision of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, as to matters within its designated authority, which committee the director reasonably believes to merit confidence;</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>provided that the director shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if the director has or should have knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.  A director who so performs the director's duties shall have no liability by reason of being or having been a director of the corporation.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A director of a corporation who is present at a meeting of its board of directors at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the director's dissent shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless the director shall file the director's written dissent to the action with the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting.  The right to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of the action.
