Nor shall any action or proceeding be maintained in any court of this State by any successor or assignee of the corporation on any right, claim, or demand arising out of the transaction of business by the corporation in this State, until a certificate of authority shall have been obtained by the corporation or by a corporation which has acquired all or substantially all of its assets.</P>
