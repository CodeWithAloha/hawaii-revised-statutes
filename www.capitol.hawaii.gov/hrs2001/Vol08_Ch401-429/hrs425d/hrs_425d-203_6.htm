The cancellation of the certificate shall not relieve the general partners of liability for the penalties for the failure to file any statement or certificate required by this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Within two years after the involuntary cancellation of a certificate of limited partnership under this section, the certificate of limited partnership may be reinstated by the director upon written application executed by any general partner of the limited partnership setting forth such information as the director may require, and the payment of all delinquent fees, penalties, assessments, taxes, costs of involuntary cancellation, and the filing of all statements due and unfiled.  Within the applicable reinstatement period, should the name of the limited partnership, or a name substantially identical thereto, be registered or reserved by another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or limited liability partnership, or should such name or a name substantially identical thereto be registered as a trade name, trademark, or service mark, then reinstatement shall be allowed only upon the registration of a new name by the limited partnership pursuant to the amendment provisions of this chapter.
