<P>&#9;(b)  The attorney general upon determining that one or more grounds exist under section 414D-283(b) for revocation of a certificate of authority shall request the department director to give, and the department director shall give, the foreign corporation written notice of that determination by mailing the notice to the foreign corporation at its last known address appearing in the records of the department director.</P>

The department director shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the foreign corporation under section 414D-280.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The authority of a foreign corporation to transact business in this State shall cease on the date shown on the certificate revoking its certificate of authority.</P>

Service of process on the department director under this subsection shall be service on the foreign corporation.  Upon receipt of process, the department director shall mail a copy of the process to the foreign corporation at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or in any subsequent communications received from the corporation stating the current mailing address of its principal office, or, if none are on file, in its application for a certificate of authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Revocation of a foreign corporation's certificate of authority does not terminate the authority of the registered agent of the corporation. [L 2001, c 105, pt of §1]</P>
