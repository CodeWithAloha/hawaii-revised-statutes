<P>&#9;(b)  The director may not revoke a certificate of authority of a foreign limited liability company unless the director sends the company notice of the revocation, at least sixty days before its effective date, by a record addressed to its agent for service of process in this State, or if the company fails to appoint and maintain a proper agent in this State, addressed to its last known address appearing in the director's records.  The notice shall identify the cause for the revocation of the certificate of authority.  If the foreign limited liability company does not cure its failure by the date specified in the notice of revocation, the director may issue a certificate of revocation in duplicate, file one of the certificates in the office of the director and mail the other certificate addressed as described in the preceding sentence to the foreign limited liability company.  The authority of the company to transact business in this State shall cease upon the issuance of the certificate of revocation. [L 1996, c 92, pt of §1; am L 2001, c 129, §101]</P>
