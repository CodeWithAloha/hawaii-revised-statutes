<P>&#9;(b)  For purposes of section 490:9-322(a), the priority of a security interest that becomes enforceable under section 490:9-203 of this article dates from the time this article takes effect if the security interest is perfected under this article by the filing of a financing statement before this article takes effect which would not have been effective to perfect the security interest under the former Article 9.  This subsection does not apply to conflicting security interests each of which is perfected by the filing of such a financing statement. [L 2000, c 241, pt of §1; ren L 2001, c 228, §14]</P>
