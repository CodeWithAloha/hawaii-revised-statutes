<P>&#9;(d)  Failure to give the notice specified in subsection (b) or to mention fraud, forgery, or expiration in the notice does not preclude the issuer from asserting as a basis for dishonor, fraud, or forgery as described in section 490:5-109(a) or expiration of the letter of credit before presentation.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  An issuer shall observe the standard practice of financial institutions that regularly issue letters of credit.  Determination of the issuer's observance of the standard practice is a matter of interpretation for the court.  The court shall offer the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence of the standard practice.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  An issuer is not responsible for:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Observance or knowledge of the usage of a particular trade other than the standard practice referred to in subsection (e).</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(g)  If an undertaking constituting a letter of credit contains nondocumentary conditions, an issuer shall disregard the nondocumentary conditions and treat them as if they were not stated.</P>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Except as otherwise provided in sections 490:5-110 and 490:5-117, is precluded from restitution of money paid or other value given by mistake to the extent the mistake concerns discrepancies in the documents or tender that are apparent on the face of the presentation; and</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Is discharged to the extent of its performance under the letter of credit unless the issuer honored a presentation in which a required signature of a beneficiary was forged. [L 1996, c 39, pt of §1]</P>
