</B><P>  This section is designed to safeguard a person holding a right of action from any unintentional loss of rights by the ill-advised use of such terms as "cancellation", "rescission", or the like.  Once a party's rights have accrued they are not to be lightly impaired by concessions made in business decency and without intention to forego them.  Therefore, unless the cancellation of a contract expressly declares that it is "without reservation of rights", or the like, it cannot be considered to be a renunciation under this section.</P>
