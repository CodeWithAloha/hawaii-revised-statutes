<P>  <B>Prior</B> <B>Uniform</B> <B>Statutory</B> <B>Provision:</B>  Subsection (1) - Sections 53(1)(b), 54(1)(c) and 57, Uniform Sales Act; Subsection (2) - none; Subsection (3) - Section 76(3), Uniform Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Rewritten, the protection given to a seller who has sold on credit and has delivered goods to the buyer immediately preceding his insolvency being extended.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes</B> <B>of</B> <B>Changes</B> <B>and</B> <B>New</B> <B>Matter:</B>  To make it clear that:</P>
<P>  1.  The seller's right to withhold the goods or to stop delivery except for cash when he discovers the buyer's insolvency is made explicit in subsection (1) regardless of the passage of title, and the concept of stoppage has been extended to include goods in the possession of any bailee who has not yet attorned to the buyer.</P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (2) takes as its base line the proposition that any receipt of goods on credit by an insolvent buyer amounts to a tacit business misrepresentation of solvency and therefore is fraudulent as against the particular seller.  This Article makes discovery of the buyer's insolvency and demand within a ten day period a condition of the right to reclaim goods on this ground.  The ten day limitation period operates from the time of receipt of the goods.</P>
<P>  An exception to this time limitation is made when a written misrepresentation of solvency has been made to the particular seller within three months prior to the delivery.  To fall within the exception the statement of solvency must be in writing, addressed to the particular seller and dated within three months of the delivery.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsection (3) subjects the right of reclamation to certain rights of third parties "under this Article (Section 2-403)."  The rights so given priority of course include the rights given to purchasers from the buyer by Section 2-403(1) and (2).  They also include other rights arising under Article 2, such as the rights of lien creditors of the buyer under Section 2-326(3) on consignment sales.  Moreover, since Section 2-403(4) incorporates by reference rights given to other purchasers and to lien creditors by Articles 6, 7 and 9, such rights have the same priority.  "Lien creditor" here has the same meaning as in Section 9-301(3).  Thus if a seller retains an unperfected security interest, subordinate under Section 9-301(1)(b) to the rights of a levying creditor of the buyer, his right of reclamation under this section is also subject to the creditor's rights.  Purchasers or lien creditors may also have rights not arising under this Article; under Section 1-103 such rights may have priority by virtue of supplementary principles not displaced by this Section.  See In re Kravitz, 278 F.2d 820 (3d Cir. 1960).</P>
<P>  Because the right of the seller to reclaim goods under this section constitutes preferential treatment as against the buyer's other creditors, subsection (3) provides that such reclamation bars all his other remedies as to the goods involved.</P>
