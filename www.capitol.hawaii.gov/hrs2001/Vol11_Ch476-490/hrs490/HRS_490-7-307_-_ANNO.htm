<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Sections 27 through 32, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Rewritten; lien extended to carrier.  Lien of common carrier validated unless carrier had notice that consignor lacked authority to subject the goods to charges and expenses.  Where the carrier is not required by law to receive the goods for transportation, lien validated against anyone who permitted the bailor to have possession even if he had no real or apparent authority.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  The section is intended to give carriers a specific statutory lien for charges and expenses similar to that given to warehousemen by the first sentence of Section 7-209.  But since carriers do not commonly claim a lien for charges in relation to other goods or lend money on the security of goods in their hands, provisions for a general lien or a security interest similar to those in Section 7-209(1) and (2) are omitted.  See Comment to Section 7-105.  Since the lien given by this section is specific, and the storage or transportation often preserves or increases the value of the goods, subsection (2) validates the lien against anyone who permitted the bailor to have possession of the goods.  Where the carrier is required to receive the goods for transportation, the owner's interest may be subjected to charges and expenses arising out of deposit of his goods by a thief.  Cf. Section 9-310.  The crucial mental element is the carrier's knowledge or reason to know of the bailor's lack of authority.</P>
