<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  This section makes consideration unnecessary to the effective renunciation or waiver of rights or claims arising out of an alleged breach of a commercial contract where such renunciation is in writing and signed and delivered by the aggrieved party.  Its provisions, however, must be read in conjunction with the section imposing an obligation of good faith.  (Section 1-203).  There may, of course, also be an oral renunciation or waiver sustained by consideration but subject to Statute of Frauds provisions and to the section of Article 2 on Sales dealing with the modification of signed writings (Section 2-209).  As is made express in the latter section this Act fully recognizes the effectiveness of waiver and estoppel.</P>
