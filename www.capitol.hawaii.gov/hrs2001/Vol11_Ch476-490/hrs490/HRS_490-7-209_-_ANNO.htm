<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </B>Sections 27 through 32, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Rewritten.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Subsection (1) defines the warehouseman's statutory lien.  A specific lien attaches automatically, without express notation on the receipt, to goods stored under a non-negotiable receipt.  That lien is limited to the usual charges arising out of a storage transaction; by notation on the receipt it can be made a general lien extending to like charges in relation to other goods.  The same rules apply where the receipt is negotiable, except that as against a holder by due negotiation the lien is limited to the amount or rate specified on the receipt, or, if none is specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods after the date of the receipt.</P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (2) provides for a security interest based upon agreement.  Such a security interest arises out of relations between the parties other than bailment for storage or transportation, as where the bailee assumes the role of financer or performs a manufacturing operation, extending credit in reliance upon the goods covered by the receipt.  Such a security interest is not a statutory lien.  Compare Sections 9-102(2) and 9-310.  It is governed in all respects by Article 9, except that subsection (2) requires that the receipt specify a maximum amount and limits the security interest to the amount specified.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsections (1) and (2) validate the lien and security interest "against the bailor."  As against third parties, subsection (3) continues the rule under the prior uniform statutory provision that to validate the lien the owner must have entrusted the goods to the depositor, and that the circumstances must be such that a pledge by the depositor to a good faith purchaser for value would have been valid.  Thus the owner's interest will not be subjected to a lien or security interest arising out of a deposit of his goods by a thief.  The warehouseman may be protected because of the actual, implied or apparent authority of the depositor, because of a Factor's Act, or because of other circumstances which would protect a bona fide pledgee, unless those circumstances are denied effect under Section 7-503.  Where the third party is the holder of a security interest, the rights of the warehouseman depend on the priority given to a hypothetical bona fide pledgee by Article 9, particularly Section 9-312.  Thus the special priority granted to statutory liens by Section 9-310 does not apply to liens under subsection (1) of this section, since subsection (3) "expressly provides otherwise" within the meaning of Section 9-310.</P>
<P>  4.  It is unnecessary to state here, as in Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act 31, that a bailee with a valid lien need not deliver until the lien is satisfied.  Section 7-403 provides that a person demanding delivery under a document must be prepared to satisfy the bailee's lien.</P>
<P>  5.  Where goods have been stored under a non-negotiable warehouse receipt and are sold by the person to whom the receipt has been issued, frequently the goods are not withdrawn by the new owner.  The obligations of the seller of the goods in this situation are set forth in Section 2-503(4) on tender of delivery and include procurement of an acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods.  If a new receipt is requested, such an acknowledgment can be withheld until storage charges have been paid or provided for.  The statutory lien for charges on the goods sold, granted by the first sentence of subsection (1), continues valid unless the bailee gives it up.  But once a new receipt is issued to the buyer, the buyer becomes "the person on whose account the goods are held" under the second sentence of subsection (1); unless he undertakes liability for charges in relation to other goods stored by the seller, there is no general lien against the buyer for such charges.  Of course, the bailee may preserve the general lien in such a case either by an arrangement by which the buyer "is liable for" such charges, or by reserving a security interest under subsection (2).</P>
