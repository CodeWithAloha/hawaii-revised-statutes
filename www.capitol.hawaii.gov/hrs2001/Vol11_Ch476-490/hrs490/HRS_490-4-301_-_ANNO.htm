<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  None; but see American Bankers Association Model Deferred Posting Statute.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Deferred posting and delayed returns is that practice whereby a payor bank sorts and proves items received by it on the day they are received, e.g. Monday, but does not post the items to the customer's account or return "not good" items until the next day, e.g. Tuesday.  The practice typifies "production line" methods currently used in bank collection and is based upon the necessity of an even flow of items through payor banks on a day by day basis in a manner which can be handled evenly by employee personnel without abnormal peak load periods, night work, and other practices objectionable to personnel.  Since World War II statutes authorizing deferred posting and delayed returns have been passed in almost all of the forty-eight states.  This section codifies the content of these statutes and approves the practice.</P>
<P>  2.  The time limits for action imposed by Subsection (1) are adopted by Subsection (2) for cases where the payor bank is also the depositary bank, but in this case the requirement of a settlement on the day of receipt is omitted.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsection (3) fixes a base point from which to measure the time within which notice of dishonor must be given.  See Section 3-508.</P>
<P>  4.  Subsection (4) leaves banks free to agree upon the manner of returning items but establishes a precise time when an item is "returned".  For definition of "sent" as used in subsections (a) and (b) see Section 1-201(38).</P>
<P>  5.  Obviously the section assumes that the item has not been "finally paid" under Section 4-213(1).  If it has been, this section has no operation.</P>
