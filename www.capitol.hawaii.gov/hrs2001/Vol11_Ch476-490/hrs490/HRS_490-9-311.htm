<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A statute, regulation, or treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property preempt section 490:9-310(a);</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Chapter 286; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A certificate-of-title statute of another jurisdiction which provides for a security interest to be indicated on the certificate as a condition or result of the security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  Compliance with the requirements of a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) for obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor is equivalent to the filing of a financing statement under this article.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) and sections 490:9-313 and 490:9-316(d) and (e) for goods covered by a certificate of title, a security interest in property subject to a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) may be perfected only by compliance with those requirements, and a security interest so perfected remains perfected notwithstanding a change in the use or transfer of possession of the collateral.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) and section 490:9-316(d) and (e), duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest perfected by compliance with the requirements prescribed by a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) are governed by the statute, regulation, or treaty.  In other respects, the security interest is subject to this article.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  During any period in which collateral subject to a statute specified in subsection (a)(2) is inventory held for sale or lease by a person or leased by that person as lessor and that person is in the business of selling goods of that kind, this section does not apply to a security interest in that collateral created by that person.
