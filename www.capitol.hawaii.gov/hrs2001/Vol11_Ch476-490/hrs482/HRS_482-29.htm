<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;[§482-29]  Classification.</B>  The director may by rule establish a classification of goods and services for convenience of administration of this part, but not to limit or extend the applicant's or registrant's rights, and a single application for registration of a mark may include any or all goods upon which, or services with which, the mark is actually being used indicating the appropriate class or classes of goods or services.  When a single application includes goods or services which fall within multiple classes, the director may require payment of a fee for each class.  To the extent practical, the classification of goods and services should conform to the classification adopted by the United States patent and trademark office. [L 2001, c 15, pt of §1]</P>
