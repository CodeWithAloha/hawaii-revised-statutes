<P>&#9;(c)  The director may also require that a drawing of the mark accompany the application and comply with requirements the director may specify in rules.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The application shall be signed and verified by the applicant, a member of the firm, or an officer of the corporation or association applying.
