</B>
<P>  Defendant's motion for summary judgment denied, where, inter alia, (1) defendant's hotel did not "front" the beach within the meaning of this statute because it was not contiguous with the beach; thus, defendant not protected by the limitations on liability contained in this statute; and (2) court not persuaded by defendant's argument that this statute abrogated the liability of all hotelkeepers for ocean-related injuries.   98 F. Supp. 2d 1129.</P>
