<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§481F-5]  Express warranties.</B>  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision in any other law to the contrary, whenever the seller of print multiples furnishes a purchaser informational details required by section 481F-4, such information shall be presumed to be part of the basis of the bargain and shall create an express warranty as to the information furnished. </P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The express warranty shall not be negated or limited because the seller did not have a specific intention or authorization to make a warranty or because any information furnished to the purchaser purports to be merely the seller's opinion. </P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The existence of a factual basis for the information furnished to the purchaser shall not be a defense against the purchaser in an action to enforce the express warranty. [L 1986, c 194, pt of §2]</P>
