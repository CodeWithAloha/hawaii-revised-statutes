<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§431:3-408  Confidentiality and prohibition on announcements;</B> <B>prohibition on use in ratemaking.  </B>(a)  All risk-based capital reports (to the extent the information therein is not required to be set forth in a publicly available annual statement schedule) and risk-based capital plans (including the results or report of any examination or analysis of an insurer performed pursuant to this part and any corrective order issued by the commissioner pursuant to examination or analysis) with respect to any domestic insurer or foreign insurer which are filed with the commissioner, constitute information that might be damaging to the insurer if made available to its competitors, and therefore shall be kept confidential by the commissioner.  This information shall not be made public or be subject to subpoena, other than by the commissioner and then only to enforce actions taken by the commissioner pursuant to this part or any other provision of the insurance laws of this State.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The comparison of an insurer's total adjusted capital to any of its risk-based capital levels is a regulatory tool which may indicate the need for possible corrective action with respect to the insurer and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally.  Therefore, except as otherwise required under this part, the making, publishing, disseminating, circulating, or placing before the public, or causing, directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in a newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio or television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement, or statement containing an assertion, representation, or statement with regard to the risk-based capital levels of any insurer, or of any component derived in the calculation, by any insurer, agent, broker, or other person engaged in any manner in the insurance business would be misleading and is therefore prohibited; provided that if any materially false statement with respect to the comparison regarding an insurer's total adjusted capital to its risk-based capital levels (or any of them) or an inappropriate comparison of any other amount to the insurer's risk-based capital levels is published in any written publication and the insurer is able to demonstrate to the commissioner with substantial proof the falsity of the statement, or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then the insurer may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false statement.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The risk-based capital instructions, risk-based capital reports, adjusted risk-based capital reports, risk-based capital plans, and revised risk-based capital plans are intended solely for use by the commissioner in monitoring the solvency of insurers and the need for possible corrective action with respect to insurers and shall not be used by the commissioner for ratemaking, nor considered or introduced as evidence in any rate proceeding, nor used by the commissioner to calculate or derive any elements of an appropriate premium level or rate of return for any line of insurance which an insurer or any affiliate is authorized to write.
