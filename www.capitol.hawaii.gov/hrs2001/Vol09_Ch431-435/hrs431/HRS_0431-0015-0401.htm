<P>&#9;<B>§431:15-401  Conservation of property of foreign or alien insurers found in this State.</B>  (a)  If a domiciliary liquidator has not been appointed, the commissioner may apply to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit by verified petition for an order directing the commissioner to act as conservator to conserve the property of an alien insurer not domiciled in this State or a foreign insurer on any one or more of the following grounds:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Any of the grounds in section 431:15-301;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;That any of its property has been sequestered by official action in its domiciliary state, or in any other state;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;That enough of its property has been sequestered in a foreign country to give reasonable cause to fear that the insurer is or may become insolvent; or</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;That its certificate of authority to do business in this State has been revoked or that none was ever issued, and that there are residents of this State with outstanding claims or outstanding policies.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  When an order is sought under subsection (a), the court may require an appropriate notice to the insurer and a hearing and may issue the order in whatever terms it considers appropriate.  The filing or recording of the order with the bureau of conveyances imparts the same notice as an evidence of title.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The conservator may at any time petition for and the court may grant an order under section 431:15-402 to liquidate assets of a foreign or alien insurer under conservation, or if appropriate, for an order under section 431:15-404, to be appointed ancillary receiver.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The conservator may at any time petition the court for an order terminating conservation of an insurer.  If the court finds that the conservation is no longer necessary, it shall order that the insurer be restored to possession of its property and the control of its business.  The court may also make such finding and issue such order at any time upon motion of any interested party, but if such motion is denied all costs, including the reasonable attorney's fee of the conservator, shall be assessed against such party.
