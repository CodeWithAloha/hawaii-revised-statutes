<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§431:15-103.5]</B>  <B>Standards and authority.</B>  (a)  The following standards, either singly or in a combination of two or more, may be considered by the commissioner to determine whether the continued operation of any insurer transacting insurance business in this State may be deemed to be hazardous to the policyholders, creditors, or the general public:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Adverse findings reported in financial condition and market conduct examination reports;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' insurance regulatory information system and its related reports;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The ratios of commission expense, general insurance expense, policy benefits, and reserve increases as to annual premium and net investment income that could lead to an impairment of capital and surplus;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The insurer's asset portfolio, when viewed in light of current economic conditions, is not of sufficient value, liquidity, or diversity to assure the company's ability to meet its outstanding obligations as they mature;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The ability of an assuming reinsurer to perform and whether the insurer's reinsurance program provides sufficient protection for the company's remaining surplus after taking into account the insurer's cash flow and the classes of business written as well as the financial condition of the assuming reinsurer;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The insurer's operating loss in the last twelve-month period or any shorter period of time, including but not limited to net capital gain or loss, change in non- admitted assets, and cash dividends paid to shareholders, is greater than fifty per cent of such insurer's remaining surplus as regards policyholders in excess of the minimum required;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Whether any affiliate, subsidiary, or reinsurer is insolvent, threatened with insolvency, or delinquent in payment of its monetary or other obligations;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Contingent liabilities, pledges, or guaranties that, either individually or collectively, involve a total amount that, in the opinion of the commissioner, may affect the solvency of the insurer;</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;Whether any "controlling person" of an insurer is delinquent in the transmitting to, or payment of, net premiums to such insurer;</P>
<P>    (10)&#9;The age and collectibility of receivables;</P>
<P>    (11)&#9;Whether management of an insurer, including officers, directors, or any other person who directly or indirectly controls the operation of such insurer, fails to possess and demonstrate the competence, fitness, and reputation deemed necessary to serve the insurer in such position;</P>
<P>    (12)&#9;Whether management of an insurer has failed to respond to inquiries relative to the condition of the insurer or has furnished false and misleading information concerning an inquiry;</P>
<P>    (13)&#9;Whether management of an insurer either has filed any false or misleading sworn financial statement, or has released any false or misleading financial statement to lending institutions or to the general public, or has made a false or misleading entry, or has omitted an entry of material amount in the books of the insurer;</P>
<P>    (14)&#9;Whether the insurer has grown so rapidly and to such an extent that it lacks adequate financial and administrative capacity to meet its obligations in a timely manner; and</P>
<P>    (15)&#9;Whether the company has experienced, or will experience in the foreseeable future, cash flow or liquidity problems or both.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  For the purposes of making a determination of an insurer's financial condition under this part, the commissioner may:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Disregard any credit or amount receivable resulting from transactions with a reinsurer that is insolvent, impaired, or otherwise subject to a delinquency proceeding;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Make appropriate adjustments to asset values attributable to investments in or transactions with parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Refuse to recognize the stated value of accounts receivable if the ability to collect receivables is highly speculative in view of the age of the account or the financial condition of the debtor; or</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Increase the insurer's liability in an amount equal to any contingent liability, pledge, or guarantee not otherwise included if there is a substantial risk that the insurer will be called upon to meet the obligation undertaken within the next twelve-month period.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  If the commissioner determines that the continued operation of the insurer licensed to transact business in this State may be hazardous to the policyholders or the general public, the commissioner may, upon the commissioner's determination, issue an order requiring the insurer to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Reduce the total amount of present and potential liability for policy benefits by reinsurance;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Reduce, suspend, or limit the volume of business being accepted or renewed;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Reduce general insurance and commission expenses by specified methods;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Increase the insurer's capital and surplus;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Suspend or limit the declaration and payment of dividends by an insurer to its stockholders or to its policyholders;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;File reports in a form acceptable to the commissioner concerning the market value of the insurer's assets;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Limit or withdraw from certain investments or discontinue certain investment practices to the extent the commissioner deems necessary;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Document the adequacy of premium rates in relation to the risks insured;</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;File, in addition to regular annual statements, interim financial reports on the form adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or on such forms as approved by the commissioner.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  Any insurer subject to an order under subsection (c) may request a hearing to review that order pursuant to chapter 91. [L 1993, c 321, §3]</P>
