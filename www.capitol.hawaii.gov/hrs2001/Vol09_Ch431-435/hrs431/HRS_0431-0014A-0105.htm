The board shall consist of nine voting members and one nonvoting member.  The voting members shall consist of the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Eight directors who shall be owners, officers, or employees of policyholders of the company and shall represent each of the company divisions; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;One director who shall be a public, at-large member elected by the board of directors.</P></DIR>

<P>The administrator shall be the nonvoting member of the board.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The initial eight division directors shall be appointed by the governor within sixty days of June 19, 1996, and shall serve for terms of one year each.  The governor shall ensure adequate representation from the major sectors of the economy and workforce in the State.</P>
<P>&#9;The public, at-large member initially elected by the board shall serve for a term of one year.</P>
<P>&#9;The initial board of directors shall determine the staggering and length of future directors' terms; provided that no term shall exceed three years.  Upon the expiration of the terms of the initial division directors, the company's policyholders in the division represented by the director shall elect the directors.  Each director shall serve for terms as specified by the board unless sooner removed for cause pursuant to rules adopted by the board.  Each director shall hold office until a successor is elected as provided in this section.  No person shall serve more than two full terms as director.
