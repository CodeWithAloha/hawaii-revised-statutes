<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Unreasonably reject a contract of insurance furnished by the borrower where insurance is required by the loan or credit transaction.  A rejection shall not be deemed unreasonable if it is based on reasonable standards, uniformly applied, relating to the extent of coverage required and the financial soundness and the services of an insurer.  Such standards shall not discriminate against any particular type of insurer, nor shall such standards call for rejection of an insurance contract because the contract contains coverage in addition to that required in the loan or credit transaction;</P>

Compliance with disclosures as to insurance required by Truth-In- Lending laws or comparable state laws shall be in compliance with this paragraph.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The commissioner shall have the power to examine and investigate those insurance related activities of any person whom the commissioner believes may be in violation of this section. Any affected person may submit to the commissioner a complaint or material pertinent to the enforcement of this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Nothing in this section shall prevent a person who lends money or extends credit from placing insurance on real or personal property in the event the mortgagor, borrower, or purchaser has failed to provide required insurance in accordance with the terms of the loan or credit document.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Nothing contained in this section shall apply to credit life or credit disability insurance.</P>

Nothing in this section shall prevent a person who lends money or extends credit from referring a mortgagor, borrower, or purchaser to the Hawaii hurricane relief fund.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  The commissioner shall adopt rules to prevent any bank, or subsidiary or affiliate thereof, which is engaged in insurance activities, from draining assets to the detriment of the insurance operations; and shall also adopt rules to obtain diverted assets from the bank, subsidiary, or affiliate in the case of insolvency of the insurance operation.
