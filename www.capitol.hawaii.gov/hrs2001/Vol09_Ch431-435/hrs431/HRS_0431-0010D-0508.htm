<P>&#9;(c)  Where it is determined that the requirements of this part have not been met the replacing insurer shall provide to the policy owner an in force illustration if available or policy summary for the replacement policy or available disclosure document for the replacement contract and the appropriate notice regarding replacements required under this part.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Violations of this part shall subject the violators to penalties that may include the revocation or suspension of a producer's or company's license, monetary fines and the forfeiture of any commissions or compensation paid to a producer as a result of the transaction in connection with which the violations occurred.  In addition, where the commissioner has determined that the violations were material to the sale, the insurer may be required to make restitution, restore policy or contract values, and pay appropriate interest on the amount refunded in cash.
