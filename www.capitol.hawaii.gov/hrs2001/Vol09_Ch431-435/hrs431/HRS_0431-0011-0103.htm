<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Any kind of insurance business authorized by the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Acting as an insurance broker or as an insurance agent for its parent or for any of its parent's insurer subsidiaries;</P>

<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Rendering other services related to the operations of an insurance business including, but not limited to, actuarial, loss prevention, safety engineering, data processing, accounting, claims, appraisal, and collection services;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Ownership and management of assets which the parent corporation could itself own or manage; provided that the aggregate investment by the insurer and its subsidiaries acquired or organized pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the limitations applicable to the investments by the insurer;</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;Acting as administrative agent for a governmental instrumentality which is performing an insurance function;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)&#9;Financing of insurance premiums, agents, and other forms of consumer financing;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)&#9;Any other business activity determined by the commissioner to be reasonably ancillary to an insurance business; and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)&#9;Owning a corporation or corporations engaged or organized to engage exclusively in one or more of the businesses specified in this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities permitted in this chapter, a domestic insurer may also:</P>
<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of ten per cent of the insurer's assets or fifty per cent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders; provided that after the investments, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.  In calculating the amount of the investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries shall be excluded, and there shall be included:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities, and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer; provided that each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that the investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in paragraph (1) or in this chapter.  For the purpose of this subsection, the total investment of the insurer shall include:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the ownership of the subsidiary; and</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;With the approval of the commissioner, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of one or more subsidiaries; provided that after the investment, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to subsection (b) shall not be subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in this code applicable to investments of insurers.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Whether any investment pursuant to subsection (b) meets the applicable requirements thereof is to be determined before the investment is made, by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment therein made pursuant to this section within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after the investment shall have been made, the investment shall have met the requirements for investment under any other section of this code, and the insurer has notified the commissioner thereof.
