<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The charter tour trust liability account shall be reduced by the amount of actual payments made by the charter tour operator for air transportation, hotel accommodations, baggage handling, or ground transportation charges with respect to the charter tour operator's current obligations to provide travel services or to past travel services provided by the charter tour operator; provided that the charter tour trust liability account shall not be reduced for any expenditure which constitutes a qualified prepaid charter tour client trust asset;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The charter tour trust liability account shall be reduced by the amount of payments made by the charter tour operator of federal transportation taxes that are payable as a result of a charter tour and for commissions payable to third party travel agents; and</P>
