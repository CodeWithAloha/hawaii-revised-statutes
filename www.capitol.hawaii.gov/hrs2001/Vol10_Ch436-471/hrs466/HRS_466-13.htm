The identity of the person for whom the professional work is done shall be preserved in confidence.  In the event the review discloses information that a firm has not met the appropriate professional standards, the board may require further investigation of the firm.</P>
<P>&#9;Neither the proceedings nor the records of the quality review committees shall be subject to discovery.  Except as hereinafter provided, no person in attendance at a meeting of the committee shall be required to testify as to what transpired at the meeting; provided that the statements made by any person in attendance at the meeting who is a party to an action or proceeding the subject matter of which was reviewed at the meeting, shall be subject to discovery.
