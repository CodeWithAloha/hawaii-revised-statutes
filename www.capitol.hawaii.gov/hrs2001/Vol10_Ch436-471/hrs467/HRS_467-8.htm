<P>&#9;(b)  Prior to submitting to prelicensing education or examination requirements, an individual candidate may request that the commission consider a preliminary decision as to whether the individual candidate for a real estate license will be denied a real estate license pursuant to section 467-8(a)(3).  The individual candidate shall submit a completed application, all information requested by the commission, and the nonrefundable application fee as provided in rules adopted by the director pursuant to chapter 91.  The preliminary decision shall provide advisory guidance, shall not be construed as binding, and shall not be subject to appeal.  The individual candidate seeking a preliminary decision shall not be considered an applicant for licensure.  A preliminary decision that is unfavorable to the individual shall not prevent the individual from submitting a complete license application and fees after successful completion of the prelicensing requirements.
