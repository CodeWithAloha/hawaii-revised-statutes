<P>  Where pending claims exceed available funds, funds may be distributed pro rata to claimants.  68 H. 550, 722 P.2d 460.</P>
<P>  Aggrieved party must notify the commission at the time the action is commenced.  70 H. 536, 777 P.2d 709.</P>
<P>  Second complaint was timely; where appellants failed to notify real estate commission of dismissal of first complaint and of filing of second complaint, any technical non-compliance by appellants with the statutory requirements of subsection (a) constituted harmless error.   76 H. 39, 868 P.2d 457.</P>
<P>  Appeal of denial of post-judgment motion for order directing payment of judgment out of fund dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction as circuit court's jurisdiction in case had not ceased; amended default judgment was not final judgment where claims were still pending or unresolved against some defendants.  80 H. 270 (App.), 909 P.2d 598.</P>
