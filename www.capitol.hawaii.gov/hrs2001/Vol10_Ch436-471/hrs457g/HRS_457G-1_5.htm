<P>&#9;(b)  The department shall maintain and biennially update a list of the names and business addresses of the occupational therapists who are registered under subsection (a).</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply to occupational therapy assistants.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A registration granted under this chapter</P>
