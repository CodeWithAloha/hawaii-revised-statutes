<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;[§577-7.5  Parental preferences in government contracts, programs, and services.]  </B><I>[Section effective July 1, 2002.]</I>  (a)  The purpose of this section is to help to eliminate any preference in a state or county executive agency contract, program, or service that favors one parent over the other in terms of child-rearing; provided that nothing in this section is intended to affect maternity benefits.  This section shall not serve as a legal basis to invalidate any state or county contract, program, or service.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>(b)  All state and county executive agencies with contracts, programs, and services that affect parental roles in children's health, welfare, and education shall review those contracts, programs, and services, in the sole discretion of the agency, and determine whether a preference exists that favors one parent over another in the raising of their children.  If a determination in the sole discretion of the agency is made that a preference exists, it shall direct its staff to analyze the preference and determine whether it unfairly precludes a parent from participating in child-rearing.  If so, the state or county agency shall seek to eliminate that preference by encouraging modifications to ensure the inclusion of both parents in all contracts, programs, and services designed to assist in the raising of children; provided that this provision shall in no instance be interpreted to reduce or negatively impact maternity leave benefits or require any changes in personnel programs or work force policies.<B> </P>
<P>&#9;</B>(c)  This section shall not apply to a preference that:</P><DIR>
