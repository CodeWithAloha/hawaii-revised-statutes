<P>  A chapter 586 protective order does not unconstitutionally curtail a person's freedom of movement.  85 H. 197 (App.), 940 P.2d 404.</P>
<P>  The order to a respondent to show cause under subsection (a) is a direction from the court to appear at a hearing to answer and to respond to the petition’s allegations, rather than a mandate which places the burden on the respondent of initially going forward with evidence to prove the negative of the allegations.  91 H. 438 (App.), 984 P.2d 1264.</P>
<P>  Unless expressly permitted by the court, §134-7(f) unqualifiedly prohibits a person subject to an order under this chapter from possession and control of a firearm during the pendency of that order; this prohibition is effective irrespective of whether the respondent owned the firearms involved.  91 H. 438 (App.), 984 P.2d 1264.</P>
