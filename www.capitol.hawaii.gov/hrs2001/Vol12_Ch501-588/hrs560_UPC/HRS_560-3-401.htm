</B>
<P>&#9;<B>§560:3-401</B>  <B>Formal testacy proceedings; nature; when commenced.</B>  (a)  A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will.  A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing a petition as described in section 560:3-402(a) in which the person requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will which is the subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with section 560:3-402(b) for an order that the decedent died intestate.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated.  A formal testacy proceeding may, but need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the registrar shall not act upon any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain from exercising the personal representative's power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding.  A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the powers of the personal representative's office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator.  In the absence of a request, or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.
