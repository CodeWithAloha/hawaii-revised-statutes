<P>&#9;<B>[§507-61]  Definitions.</B>  Whenever used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires:</P>
<P>&#9;"Last known address" means the address provided by the occupant in the latest rental agreement, or the address provided by the occupant in a subsequent written notice of a change of address.</P>
<P>&#9;"Occupant" means a person, or the person's sublessee, successor, or assign, or who is entitled to the use of designated or individual storage space at a self-service storage facility under a rental agreement, to the exclusion of others.</P>
<P>&#9;"Owner" means the owner, operator, lessor, or sublessor of a self-service storage facility, an agent thereof, or any other person authorized to manage the facility, or to receive rent from an occupant under a rental agreement, and no real estate license is required.</P>
<P>&#9;"Personal property" means movable property not affixed to land, and includes, but is not limited to, goods, merchandise, furniture, household items, motor vehicles, and boats.</P>
<P>&#9;"Rental agreement" means any written agreement or lease which establishes or modifies the terms, conditions, rules, or any other provision concerning the use and occupancy of a self-service storage facility.</P>
<P>&#9;"Self-service storage facility" means any real property designed and used for the purpose of renting or leasing designated or individual storage space to occupants who are to have access to the space for the purpose of storing and removing personal property, but does not include a garage or other storage area in a private residence.  No occupant shall use a self-service storage facility for residential purposes.  A self-service storage facility is not a warehouse, nor a public utility.  If an owner issues any warehouse receipt, bill of lading, or other document of title for the personal property stored, the owner and the occupant are subject to chapter 490, and this part does not apply.
