<P>  Where cases of minor and minor’s siblings were so interrelated, release of information would have been harmful to minor’s siblings, and redactions of information in record did not delete all information related to the other children, trial judge’s ruling granting newspaper access to the family court’s record was not in the best interest of the other children and violated the applicable legal standard in allowing access to a redacted version of the record.  91 H. 200, 982 P.2d 334.</P>
