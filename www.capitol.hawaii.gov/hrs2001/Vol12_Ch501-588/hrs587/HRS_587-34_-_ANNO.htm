<P>  Procedural due process right not denied when guardian ad litem not appointed for mother where mother was provided with court-appointed attorney and, pursuant to subsection (d), court determined mother was capable of comprehending legal significance of issues.  85 H. 119 (App.), 938 P.2d 178.</P>
<P>  Failure by guardian ad litem to submit written reports and recommendations to the court concerning the best interests of the child as mandated by subsection (c) did not require remand where guardian’s reports and recommendation would not have been determinative; other evidence amply supported court’s determination that family supervision was appropriate.  91 H. 166 (App.), 981 P.2d 723.</P>
