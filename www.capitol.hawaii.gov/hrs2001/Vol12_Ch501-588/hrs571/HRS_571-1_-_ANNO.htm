<P>  Inherent powers give family court jurisdiction to determine rights of natural father of illegitimate child.  56 H. 462, 541 P.2d 13.</P>
<P>  As this section mandates against treating juvenile adjudications as convictions, appellate court erred in holding that defendant's prior juvenile adjudication of driving without no-fault insurance constituted a conviction for purposes of applying the repeat offender sentencing provisions of §431:10C-117 (1993) to defendant's subsequent offense of driving without no-fault insurance.  92 H. 521, 993 P.2d 555.</P>
