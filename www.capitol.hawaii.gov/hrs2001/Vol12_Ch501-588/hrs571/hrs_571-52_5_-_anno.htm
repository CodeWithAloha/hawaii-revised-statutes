<P>  Agreement to pay all post-high school education expenses is not an exceptional circumstance allowing lower child support payment than specified in guidelines; guidelines do not take precedence over the parties' agreement to pay more than the guidelines specify, but they do take precedence over the parties' agreements to pay less.  7 H. App. 221, 751 P.2d 93.</P>
<P>  Whether facts constitute exceptional circumstances is a question of law.  7 H. App. 345, 764 P.2d 1250.</P>
<P>  Neither expenses for a second vehicle nor preschool expenses of another child of non-custodial obligor parent supported a finding of exceptional circumstance.  88 H. 456 (App.), 967 P.2d 653.</P>
