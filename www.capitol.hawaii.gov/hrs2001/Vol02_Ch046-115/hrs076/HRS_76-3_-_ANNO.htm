<P>  This section and §76-2 reflect an interest in ensuring that there be uniformity among the State's and the counties' civil service systems; a jurisdiction does not have to establish that it and every other civil service system in Hawaii has never previously utilized a civil servant to provide a service before it may contract for that service.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</P>
