<P>&#9;All questions requiring the construction or interpretation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of chapter 77 shall be submitted to the attorney general for an opinion and the attorney general shall render an opinion promptly on any such question when requested by the head of any department of the State or any county.  In case the opinion is in conflict with an opinion rendered upon the same or substantially similar question by any county attorney or corporation counsel and the question upon which the opinion is rendered has been raised by a county, the question may, either at the instance of the county attorney, corporation counsel or the attorney general, be submitted to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit for a declaratory judgment on the question, and jurisdiction to hear and determine the questions is hereby conferred upon the circuit court.  The circuit court shall determine the question without delay. [L 1955, c 274, pt of §1; RL 1955, §3-2; HRS §76-2; gen ch 1993]</P>
