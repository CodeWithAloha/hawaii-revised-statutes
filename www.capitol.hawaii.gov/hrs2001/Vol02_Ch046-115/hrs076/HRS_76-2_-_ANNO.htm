<P>  Because the procedure outlined in this section is limited in its application to interpretations of chapters 76 and 77, the constitutionality of any provision of the two chapters is an issue beyond the bounds of that process.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</P>
<P>  This section and §76-3 reflect an interest in ensuring that there be uniformity among the State's and the counties' civil service systems; a jurisdiction does not have to establish that it and every other civil service system in Hawaii has never previously utilized a civil servant to provide a service before it may contract for that service.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</P>
