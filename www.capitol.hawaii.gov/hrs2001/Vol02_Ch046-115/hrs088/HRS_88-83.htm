<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§88-83  Election of mode of retirement allowance.</B>  (a)  Maximum allowance:  Upon retirement, any member may elect to receive the maximum retirement allowance to which the member is entitled computed in accordance with the provisions described under section 88-74, 88-76, or 88-80 and in the event of the member's death, there shall be paid to the member's beneficiary, otherwise to the member's estate, the difference between the balance of the member's accumulated contributions at the time of the member's retirement and the retirement allowance paid or payable to the member prior to death.</P>
<P>&#9;In lieu of this maximum allowance, the member may elect to receive the member's retirement allowance under any one of the optional plans described below, which shall be actuarially equivalent to the maximum allowance.</P>
<P>&#9;Option 1:  The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime.  At the member's retirement, there shall be established an amount of initial insurance which shall be computed on the basis of actuarial factors adopted by the board of trustees.  Upon the death of the retirant, any balance remaining in the initial insurance reserve after deducting the retirement allowance paid to the retirant prior to death, shall be paid to the retirant's beneficiary, otherwise to the retirant's estate.  In lieu of the lump sum balance, the beneficiary may elect to receive an allowance for life based on the value of the balance; provided that the allowance is not less than $100 per month.</P>
<P>&#9;Option 2:  The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have such allowances, including cumulative post retirement, if applicable, continued after the member's death to the member's beneficiary during the lifetime of such person.  In the event of death of the beneficiary prior to that of the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant.</P>
<P>&#9;Option 3:  The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have one-half of such allowance, including fifty per cent of all cumulative post retirement allowances, if applicable, continued after the member's death to the member's beneficiary during the lifetime of such person.  In the event of death of the beneficiary prior to that of the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant.</P>
<P>&#9;Option 4:  The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and provide some other benefit to the member's beneficiary in accordance with the member's own specification; provided that such election shall be certified by the actuary to be the actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement allowance and shall be approved by the board.</P>
<P>&#9;Option 5:  The member may elect to receive the balance of the member's accumulated contributions at the time of retirement in a lump sum and, during the member's lifetime a retirement allowance equal to the maximum retirement allowance reduced by the actuarial equivalent of these contributions.  Upon the death of the retirant, all further payments shall cease.  Only a member retiring for service having at least ten years of credited service or for disability may elect this mode of retirement.</P>
<P>&#9;To receive benefits, the beneficiary must have been designated by the member in such form and manner as is prescribed by the board.</P>
<P>&#9;In the event of the death of the retirant within one year after the date of retirement, the retirant's beneficiary may elect to receive either the death benefits under the mode of retirement selected, or in lieu thereof, such benefits as would have been paid had the retirant died immediately prior to retirement, less any payments which the retirant received.</P>
<P>&#9;Any election of a mode of retirement allowance shall be irrevocable.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Section 88-84 to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event of the death of a member after the date of the filing of the member's written application to retire, the designated beneficiary, otherwise the personal representative of the member's estate, shall receive the allowance under the option selected by the member which would have been payable had the member retired, and the benefits paid to the beneficiary or representative shall be computed as though the member had died on or after the effective date of the member's retirement.</P>
<P>&#9;Any election of a mode of retirement shall be irrevocable.
