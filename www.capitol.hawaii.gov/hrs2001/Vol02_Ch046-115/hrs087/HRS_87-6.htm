<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§87-6  Contributions by an employee-beneficiary for health benefits plans.</B>  (a)  Each employee-beneficiary shall make a monthly contribution to the fund amounting to the difference between the monthly charge of the health benefits plan selected by the employee-beneficiary and the State's and county's contribution to the fund.</P>
<P>&#9;Nothing in this section shall prohibit any employee-beneficiary from participating in a cafeteria plan authorized under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and part II of chapter 78.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  During the period the health benefits plan selected by an employee-beneficiary is in effect, the employee-beneficiary shall authorize, if otherwise allowed by law, the employee-beneficiary's contribution to be withheld and transmitted to the fund monthly by the comptroller or finance officer who disburses the employee-beneficiary's compensation, pension, or retirement pay.  If, however, an employee-beneficiary's contribution to the fund is not withheld and transmitted to the fund, the employee-beneficiary shall pay the monthly contribution (1) directly to the fund by the first day of each month, in the case of an employee-beneficiary who normally receives the employee-beneficiary's compensation from the comptroller of the State, or (2) in the case of all other employee-beneficiaries, to the respective finance officer from whom the employee-beneficiary normally receives compensation for transmittal to the fund by the first day of each month.</P>
