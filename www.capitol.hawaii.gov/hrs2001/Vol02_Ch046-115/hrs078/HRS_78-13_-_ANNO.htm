<P>  District court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, where court granted a preliminary injunction against operation of Act 355, L 1997 (which amended this section), State's "pay lag" law, on the ground that it impaired the obligations of the employees' collective bargaining agreement in violation of the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution.  183 F.3d 1096.</P>
<P>  Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction granted, where plaintiffs filed motion seeking to enjoin defendants from delaying payroll under Act 355, L 1997 (which amended this section), with respect to University of Hawaii faculty members, arguing that Act 355 violated the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution because a five-day delay in pay violated the collective bargaining agreement between the State and the faculty members at the University.  16 F. Supp. 2d 1242.</P>
<P>  Where there was no existing contract that Act 355, L 1997 (amending this section), impaired, no contracts clause violation possible and injunction no longer needed; the case was moot.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.</P>
