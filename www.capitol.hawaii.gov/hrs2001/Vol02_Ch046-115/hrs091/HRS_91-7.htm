The action may be maintained whether or not petitioner has first requested the agency to pass upon the validity of the rule in question.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The court shall declare the rule invalid if it finds that it violates constitutional or statutory provisions, or exceeds the statutory authority of the agency, or was adopted without compliance with statutory rulemaking procedures. [L 1961, c 103, §7; Supp, §6C-7; HRS §91-7]</P>
