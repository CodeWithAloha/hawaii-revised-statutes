<P>&#9;(b)  The preference in this section may not be used in combination with any other preference otherwise available to a bidder under state or federal law.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In any section 103D-302 or 103D-303 contract for a public works project, a state agency shall award the contract to an offeror who has filed all state tax returns due to the State and paid all amounts owing on such returns for two successive years prior to submitting the offer; provided that the amount of that offer is not more than seven per cent higher than the amount offered by any competing contractor who has not filed or paid all applicable state taxes, and the amount of the offer by the state tax paying offeror is $5,000,000 or less.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  In any section 103D-302 or 103D-303 contract for a public works project, a state agency shall award the contract to an offeror who has filed all state tax returns due to the State and paid all amounts owing on such returns for four successive years prior to submitting the offer; provided that the amount of that offer is not more than seven per cent higher than the amount offered by any competing contractor who has not filed or paid all applicable state taxes, and the amount of the offer by the state tax paying offeror is more than $5,000,000.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  If two or more contractors who have paid state and county taxes or were required to submit a filing regarding state and county taxes are bidding on a public works contract, and those contractors meet the criteria outlined in subsection (c) or (d), the state agency shall award the contract to the contractor among them who has submitted the lowest bid.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting of federal assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a particular public works project because of preference awarded by this section, this section shall not apply insofar as its application would preclude or reduce federal assistance for that work.<B> </B>[L 1997, c 352, pt of §2; am L 1999, c 149, §20]</P>
