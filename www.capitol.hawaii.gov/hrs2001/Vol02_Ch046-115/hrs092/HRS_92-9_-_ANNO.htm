<P>  This section and §§92-1 and 92-7 require commission to specify subject matter of items on public meeting agenda; agency responsible to make its minutes available to public.  Att. Gen. Op. 85-2.</P>
<P>  This section and §92-5(a)(2) read together permit board and commission members to disclose some matters deliberated or decided in executive session, but they cannot disclose matters which would be inconsistent with §92-5(a)(2), i.e., matters affecting privacy of individuals under consideration for hire and they must maintain this confidentiality for as long as disclosure would defeat purpose of convening the executive meeting.  Att. Gen. Op. 94-1.</P>
