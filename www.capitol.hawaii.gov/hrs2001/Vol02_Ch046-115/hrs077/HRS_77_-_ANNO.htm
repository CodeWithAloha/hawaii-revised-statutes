<P>  Chapter repealed July 1, 2002.  L 2000, c 253, §131.</P>
<P>  Privatization; contracting of government services with the private sector (repealed June 30, 2007).  L 2001, c 90, §2.</P>
<P>  This chapter is based upon L 1955, c 274, §2, which completely reenacted RL 1945, Chapter 3.  Chapter 3 was based upon L Sp 1941, c 88, and was amended by L 1945, c 263, §§1, 3, 5, 6; L 1947, c 208, §§1, 2; L 1949, c 282, §1, c 298, §§2, 3; L 1951, c 21, §1, c 51, §3, c 319, §2, c 320, §1; L 1953, c 278, §2.  Source notes following each section commence as of L 1955, c 274.  See §76-6 making inoperative any provision which jeopardizes federal funds.</P>
<P>  Workforce restructuring:  voluntary severance benefits or special retirement incentive benefit (repealed June 30, 2003).  L 2000, c 253, §§115 to 124.</P>
<P>  L 2001, c 123, §15 provides in part:</P>
<P>  "...the rights, benefits, and privileges currently enjoyed by persons occupying civil service positions under chapters 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, and 83, Hawaii Revised Statutes, who were hired prior to July 1, 2001, shall not be diminished or impaired, until those rights, benefits, and privileges are either negotiated into collective bargaining agreements or established by executive order for civil service employees."</P>

<P>  Because the procedure outlined in §76-2 is limited in its application to interpretations of this chapter and chapter 76, the constitutionality of any provision of the two chapters is an issue beyond the bounds of that process.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</P>
