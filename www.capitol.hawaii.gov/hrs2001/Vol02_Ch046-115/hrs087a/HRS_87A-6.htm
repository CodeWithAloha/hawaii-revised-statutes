Each term shall commence on January 1 and expire on December 31.  The governor may reduce the terms of those initially appointed so as to provide, as far as practicable, for the expiration of an equal number of terms at intervals of one year.</P>
<P>&#9;A vacancy on the board shall be filled by appointment of the governor; provided that the criteria used for selecting the successor shall be the same criteria used for selecting the person's predecessor.  The person appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the term of the person's predecessor.</P>
<P>&#9;If by the end of a trustee's term a trustee is not reappointed or the trustee's successor is not appointed, the trustee shall serve until the trustee's successor is appointed. [L 2001, c 88, pt of §1]</P>
