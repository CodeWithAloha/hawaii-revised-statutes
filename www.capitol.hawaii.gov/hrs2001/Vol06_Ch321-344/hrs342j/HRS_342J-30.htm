The facilities shall be deemed to have interim status.  This subsection shall not apply to any facility which has been previously denied a permit under section 3005 of RCRA, 42 United States Code §6925 or section 342J-5 or if authority to operate the facility under section 3005 of RCRA, 42 United States Code §6925 or this section has been previously terminated.</P>

Failure to comply with such schedules shall be a basis for automatic termination of interim status. [L 1989, c 212, pt of §5; am L 1991, c 259, §14; am L 1992, c 154, §1; am L 1993, c 267, §2]</P>
