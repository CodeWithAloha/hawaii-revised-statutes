<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§328-16  Drugs limited to dispensing on prescription.</B>  (a)  A prescription drug shall be dispensed only if its label bears the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The name of the person for whom the drug was prescribed or the name of the owner of the animal for which the drug was prescribed;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The serial number of the prescription;</P>

<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The name of the practitioner if the seller is not the practitioner;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The name, strength, and quantity of the drug;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;The date the potency of the drug expires if the date is available from the manufacturer or principal labeler;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;The number of refills available, if any; and</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;Specific directions for the drug's use; provided that if the specific directions for use are too lengthy for inclusion on the label, the notation "take according to written instructions" may be used if separate written instructions for use are actually issued with the drug by the practitioner or the pharmacist, but in no event shall the notation "take as directed", referring to oral instructions, be considered acceptable.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>If any prescription for a drug does not indicate the number of times it may be refilled, if any, the pharmacist shall not refill that prescription unless subsequently authorized to do so by the practitioner.  The act of dispensing a prescription drug other than a professional sample or medical oxygen contrary to this subsection shall be deemed to be an act that results in a drug being misbranded while held for sale.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  In addition to the requirements enumerated in subsection (a), a prescription drug shall be dispensed only:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;By a pharmacist pursuant to a valid prescription;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;By a medical oxygen distributor pursuant to a prescription or certificate of medical necessity; provided that the drug to be dispensed is medical oxygen; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;By a practitioner to an ultimate user; provided that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The practitioner shall inform the patient, prior to dispensing any drug other than a professional sample, that the patient may have a written, orally ordered, or electronically transmitted or conveyed prescription directed to a pharmacy or a medical oxygen distributor of the patient's own choice;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The practitioner shall promptly record in the practitioner's records:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;The prescription in full;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;The name, strength, and quantity of the drug, and specific directions for the drug's use;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;The date the drug was dispensed; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iv)&#9;The name and address of the person for whom the drug was prescribed or the name of the owner of the animal for which the drug was prescribed;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;The records described in subparagraph (B) shall be subject to the inspection of the department or its agents at all times; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;No undisclosed rebate, refund, commission, preference, discount, or other consideration, whether in the form of money or otherwise, has been offered to the practitioner as compensation or inducement to dispense or prescribe any specific drug in preference to other drugs that might be used for the identical therapeutic indication.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;An electronic signature; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;A digital signature;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;or by other means as approved by the director;</P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The prescription is refilled only once during the three-month period;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The refill does not exceed a thirty-day supply of the drug;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;The refill does not provide any amount of the drug fifteen months beyond the date the original prescription was written;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;In the case of medical oxygen, the duration of therapy indicated on a certificate of medical necessity shall supersede any limitations or restrictions on refilling; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(E)&#9;Subparagraphs (A) to (D) shall apply only to pharmacies and medical oxygen distributors practicing in the State.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  Any prescription may be refilled by the pharmacy and a prescription for medical oxygen may be refilled by the medical oxygen distributor if that refilling is authorized by the practitioner either:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;The serial number, prescription number, control number, or other unique identifier of the prescription record from which the information was transferred;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The date the original prescription was issued;</P>

<P>&#9;(f)  For the purposes of this section, a "prescription drug" is a drug intended for use by a person that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Is a habit forming drug to which section 328-15(4) applies;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Because of its toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its use, is not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Is limited by an approved application under section 505 of the Federal Act, or section 328-17, to use under the professional supervision of a practitioner. </P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(g)  Any drug other than medical oxygen dispensed pursuant to a prescription shall be exempt from the requirements of section 328-15 (except paragraphs (1), (9), (11), and (12), and the packaging requirements of paragraphs (7) and (8)), if the drug bears a label containing:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(h)  The director of health, by rule, may remove drugs subject to sections 328-15(4) and 328-17 from the requirements of subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) when such requirements are not necessary for the protection of the public health.  Drugs removed from the prescription requirements of the Federal Act by regulations issued thereunder may also, by rules issued by the director, be removed from the requirements of subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d).</P>
<P>&#9;(i)  A drug that is subject to subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) shall be deemed to be misbranded if, at any time prior to dispensing, its label fails to bear the statement "Caution:  Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription", "Caution:  State law prohibits dispensing without prescription", or "Rx only".  A drug to which subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) do not apply shall be deemed to be misbranded if, at any time prior to dispensing, its label bears a caution statement quoted in the preceding sentence.</P>
<P>&#9;(j)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement, prescribed by or under authority of law with respect to drugs now included or that may hereafter be included within the classifications of controlled substances as defined in the applicable federal and state laws relating to controlled substances.</P>
<P>&#9;(k)  Oral code numbers or designations shall be issued by the department of public safety, pursuant to applicable laws and rules.</P>
