<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§342D-81</B> <B> Declaration of policy.</B>  The State's policy is to promote water pollution prevention and control, including the use of recycled water, by financing county and state agency eligible projects consistent with applicable federal and state laws.  The State intends such financing to occur through a revolving fund loan program that makes loans to counties and state agencies at or below market rates and a leveraging program that uses revenue bonds and revolving fund loan programs together in a coordinated manner that does not cause the state debt ceiling to be exceeded. [L 1997, c 221, pt of §1; am L 2001, c 269, §5]</P>
