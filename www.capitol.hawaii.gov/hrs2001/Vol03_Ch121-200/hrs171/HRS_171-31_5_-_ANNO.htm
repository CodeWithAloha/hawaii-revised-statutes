<P>  Where plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated their constitutional rights to due process by depriving them of their dwelling without constitutionally adequate process, and relied almost entirely on their assertion that defendants violated this section in support of their argument that they received inadequate process, plaintiffs’ reliance on this section was misplaced.  832 F. Supp. 1399.</P>
