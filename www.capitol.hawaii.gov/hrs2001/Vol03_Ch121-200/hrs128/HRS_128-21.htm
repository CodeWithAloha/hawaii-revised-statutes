<P>&#9;"I,........................, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.</P>
<P>&#9;And I do further swear (or affirm) that I do not advocate, nor am I a member or an affiliate of any organization, group, or combination of persons that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence; and that during such time as I am a member of the (name of civil defense organization), I will not advocate nor become a member or an affiliate of any organization, group, or combination of persons that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence."</P>
<P>&#9;Provided that to the extent permitted by the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 the governor by rule may provide for additional time for the taking of the oath, where compliance with the requirement before the person so required enters upon the person's duties is or may be impracticable; for like reasons the governor similarly may provide as to the oath required by part II of chapter 85.</P>
<P>&#9;The governor by rule may relieve persons, or classes of persons, subject to the requirements imposed by this section, from compliance with part II of chapter 85. [L 1951, c 268, pt of §2; RL 1955, §359-20; HRS §128-21; gen ch 1985]</P>
