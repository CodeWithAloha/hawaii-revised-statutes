<P>  Status of sections 127-1 to 127-9.  These sections are indefinitely suspended.  They were originally superseded until the expiration of chapter 128, which prior to L 1961, c 35, would have expired on June&nbsp;30, 1961.  Act 35 amended chapter 128 by deleting its expiration date, thereby continuing chapter 128 indefinitely.  See also L 1951, c 268, §1; L 1957, c 58, §1; L 1959, c 2, §2.</P>
