No forfeiture may extend to any pay or allowances accrued before that date.</P>

Rules adopted by the governor may provide that sentences of confinement may not be executed until approved by designated officers.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  All other sentences of courts-martial are effective on the date ordered executed. [L 1982, c 171, pt of §2]</P>
