<P>&#9;(b)  All sentences shall be determined by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time that the vote is taken.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote.  A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged.  A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused.  A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused. [L 1982, c 171, pt of §2]</P>
