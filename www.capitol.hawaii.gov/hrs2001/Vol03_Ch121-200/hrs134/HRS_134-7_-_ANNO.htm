</B>
<P>  Felon convicted of possessing firearm properly sentenced under this section instead of §706-610.  68 H. 622, 725 P.2d 799.</P>
<P>  Defendant exercised control when defendant sold gun.  70 H. 219, 768 P.2d 230.</P>
<P>  Previously convicted felon must have intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly possessed or controlled the firearm.  70 H. 509, 778 P.2d 704.</P>
<P>  Defendant may not assert the invalidity of the prior conviction as a defense under this section.  71 H. 101, 784 P.2d 872.</P>
<P>  Convicted person may not assert the invalidity of the prior offense as a defense to this section.  71 H. 111, 784 P.2d 873.</P>
<P>  Subsection (b) applies to felons who are convicted through a nolo contendere plea.  83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Where defendant’s convictions were premised upon the use of "any firearm" and language of indictments and trial court’s instructions "to wit, a semiautomatic pistol" did not alter the statutory elements of §§708-840, 134-6, or this section, trial court’s error of not providing definition of "semiautomatic firearm" did not warrant reversal of convictions of first degree robbery, carrying or use of firearm in commission of separate felony, or felon in possession of firearm.  91 H. 33, 979 P.2d 1059.</P>
<P>  For the purposes of subsection (b), "possession" must be analyzed using a two-pronged analysis: (1) the voluntary act of "possession" of an object "itself" is, by way of §702-202, satisfied where an individual acts knowingly with respect to his or her conduct; and (2) the requisite state of mind with respect to the attendant circumstances--i.e., the particular qualities of the object that make it illegal to possess it--is, by way of §702-204, satisfied by a reckless state of mind.  93 H. 87, 997 P.2d 13.</P>
<P>  Where one bag containing a gun was found on truck seat next to defendant and another bag with two guns was found on truck floor where defendant had been sitting, jury could have inferred from totality of circumstances that defendant had the state of mind requisite to commit possession of a firearm and/or ammunition by a person convicted of certain crimes.  93 H. 87, 997 P.2d 13.</P>
<P>  A person commits the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm, pursuant to §705-500(1)(b) and (3), and subsection (b), if he or she intentionally engages in conduct that, under the circumstances as he or she believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to culminate in his or her commission of the offense of prohibited possession of a firearm.  93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479.</P>
<P>  As the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm under this section does not include a result-of-conduct element and §705-500(2) does not therefore apply, trial court instruction erroneously defined the state of mind necessary to prove the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm as something less than intentional, as required by §705-500(1)(b).  93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479.</P>
<P>  Pursuant to §§701-109(4)(b), 705-500(1)(b) and (3), and subsection (b), attempted prohibited possession of a firearm is an included offense of prohibited possession of a firearm.  93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479.</P>
<P>  Requisite state of mind for a violation of subsection (b) is that of acting intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; failure to instruct jury on state of mind element, as required by §701-114(1)(b), was prejudicial and not harmless error.  78 H. 422 (App.), 895 P.2d 173.</P>
<P>  Where State failed to establish defendant's prior felony conviction and no lesser included offense of a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition in chapter 134, defendant's convictions of being a felon in possession of a firearm and firearm ammunition under subsection (b) reversed.  82 H. 517 (App.), 923 P.2d 934.</P>
<P>  Under subsection (b), multiple punishments are not authorized for violating the prohibition against possession of "any firearm or ammunition therefor"; thus, where defendant was already convicted of possessing a firearm, defendant could not be convicted for possession of ammunition loaded into that firearm.  89 H. 59 (App.), 968 P.2d 1070.</P>
<P>  Although evidence that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony was relevant for purposes of this section, evidence that defendant may have received ineffective assistance of counsel during that prior felony trial would not have any bearing on the validity of that felony conviction; thus, trial court did not err in precluding evidence that defendant may have received ineffective assistance during prior trial.  90 H. 489 (App.), 979 P.2d 85.</P>
<P>  Unless expressly permitted by the court, subsection (f) unqualifiedly prohibits a person subject to a chapter 586 order from possession and control of a firearm during the pendency of that order; this prohibition is effective irrespective of whether the respondent owned the firearms involved.  91 H. 438 (App.), 984 P.2d 1264.</P>
<P>  Mentioned:  9 H. App. 333, 839 P.2d 1186.</P>
