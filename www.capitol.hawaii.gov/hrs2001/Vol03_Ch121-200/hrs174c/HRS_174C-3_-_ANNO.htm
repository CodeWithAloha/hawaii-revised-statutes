<P>  Commission did not err in excluding golf course irrigation from the category of "agricultural use".  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</P>
<P>  The "reasonable-beneficial use" standard and the related criterion of "consistent with the public interest" demand examination of the proposed use not only standing alone, but also in relation to other public and private uses and the particular water source in question; thus, permit applicants requesting water diverted from streams must duly take into account the public interest in instream flows.   94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</P>
