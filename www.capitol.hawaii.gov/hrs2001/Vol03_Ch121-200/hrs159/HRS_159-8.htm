<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;Witnesses summoned before the board shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the circuit courts of the State, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking them shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts.
