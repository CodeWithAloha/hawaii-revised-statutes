<P>&#9;A husband and wife filing separate returns for a taxable year for which a joint return could have been filed by them shall claim only the tax credit to which they would have been entitled had a joint return been filed.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The tax credit under this section shall not be available to (1) any person who has been convicted of a felony and who has been committed to prison and has been physically confined for the full taxable year; (2) any person who would otherwise be eligible to be claimed as a dependent but who has been committed to a youth correctional facility and has resided at the facility for the full taxable year; or (3) any misdemeanant who has been committed to jail and has been physically confined for the full taxable year.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The tax credits claimed by a resident taxpayer pursuant to this section shall be deductible from the resident taxpayer's individual income tax liability, if any, for the tax year in which they are properly claimed.  If the tax credits claimed by a resident taxpayer exceed the amount of income tax payment due from the resident taxpayer, the excess of credits over payments due shall be refunded to the resident taxpayer; provided that tax credits properly claimed by a resident individual who has no income tax liability shall be paid to the resident individual.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If the tax credit is claimed by an individual who does not reside in the appropriate county as set forth in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), there shall be added to and become a part of the tax liability of the individual:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;All claims for tax credits under this section, including any amended claims, must be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credits may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit. [L 1990, c 184, §3; am L 1992, c 235, §§2, 3]</P>
