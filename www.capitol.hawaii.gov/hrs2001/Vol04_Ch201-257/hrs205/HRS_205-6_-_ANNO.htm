<P>  Recreational theme park on agricultural land was not "unusual and reasonable use" which would qualify for special permit.  64 H. 265, 639 P.2d 1079.</P>
<P>  "Communications equipment buildings" and "utility lines" in §205-4.5(a)(7) do not encompass "telecommunications antennas" or "transmission antennas" such as a cellular telephone tower; public utility thus had to apply for a special permit under this section to place the tower in a state agricultural district.  90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.</P>
