In any case to which this subsection relates, if the director is required to give any notice to or make any demand upon any person, the requirement shall be deemed to be satisfied if the notice or demand is prepared and signed, in any case in which the address of the person last known to the director is in an area for which United States post offices under instructions of the Postmaster General, by reason of the combatant activities, are not accepting mail for delivery at the time the notice or demand is signed.  In this case the notice or demand shall be deemed to have been given or made upon the date it is signed.</P>
