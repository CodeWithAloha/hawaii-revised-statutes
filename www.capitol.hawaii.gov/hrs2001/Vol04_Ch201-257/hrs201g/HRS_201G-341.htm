<P>&#9;<B>[§201G-341]  Purpose; findings and determinations.</B>  The legislature finds that there are approximately one hundred twelve thousand persons of all ages with physical disabilities in the State.  Many of them require alterations to their residences in order to accommodate their disabilities and assist them in maintaining independent lifestyles.  These alterations include, but are not limited to, such basic alterations as modifications to kitchens, baths, doorways, doors, cabinets, drawers, windows, and other fixtures.  These alterations are costly and largely unaffordable for persons with disabilities, many of whom live on a fixed income.  The legislature further finds that the cost of these essential residential alterations is far less than the cost of the alternative of institutional care.</P>
<P>&#9;It is the purpose of this subpart to assist persons with physical disabilities by making available affordable loans for necessary alterations to their residences in order for them to maintain independent lifestyles. [L 1997, c 350, pt of §2]</P>
