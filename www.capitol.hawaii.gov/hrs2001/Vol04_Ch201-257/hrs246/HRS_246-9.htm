The maps, as far as possible, shall show the names of owners of each division of land, and shall be revised from time to time as ownerships change and as further divisions of parcels occur.  The department shall also maintain, as and when such information is available, maps showing present use, zoning, and physical use capabilities of land within each taxation district for the guidance of assessors and the information of various tax review tribunals and the general public.</P>
<P>&#9;The director of taxation may charge fees for the use and other disposition of tracings of these maps, including copies or prints made therefrom, by private persons or firms as provided for in section 92<B>-</B>22.
