<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§246-2  Tax base and rate.</B>  Except as exempted or otherwise taxed, all real property in each county shall be subject each year to a tax upon sixty per cent or less of its fair market value determined in the manner provided by law, at such rate as shall be determined in the manner provided in section 248<B>-</B>2.  However, the director of taxation may use as the tax base a lesser percentage of fair market value; if the director does so the director shall certify to the county council the percentage so used at the time the director furnishes the council the calculations as to the tax base pursuant to section 248<B>-</B>2(d), and if the director does not do so the director shall certify to the council that the director has used sixty per cent of fair market value as the tax base.  Both as to the calculations as to the tax base and also as to the percentage of fair market value used as the tax base, the director's certificate to the council shall be conclusive insofar as the validity of any tax rate is concerned, except for the right to appeal assessments of real property as may be provided by law.  Whether the director uses as the tax base sixty per cent of fair market value or some other percentage of fair market value, no taxpayer shall be deemed aggrieved by an assessment, nor shall an assessment be lowered, except as the result of a decision on an appeal as provided by law.
