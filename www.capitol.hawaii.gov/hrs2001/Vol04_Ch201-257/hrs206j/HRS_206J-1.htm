<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§206J-1  Findings and purpose.</B>  The legislature finds that the area in downtown Honolulu on the waterfront, including the Hale Awa Ku Moku Building and Irwin Memorial Park, hereinafter called the Aloha Tower complex, is one of the most valuable properties in downtown Honolulu and that certain portions of this area should be redeveloped, renovated, or improved to better serve the economic, maritime, and recreational needs of the people of Hawaii.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature further finds that the Aloha Tower complex still serves a vital maritime function that must be maintained to insure adequacy and viability for existing and future maritime activities.</P>
<P>&#9;The purpose of this chapter is to establish a new public body corporate and politic, public instrumentality, and agency of the State for the purpose of undertaking the redevelopment of the Aloha Tower complex to strengthen the international economic base of the community in trade activities, to enhance the beautification of the waterfront, and in conjunction with the department of transportation, to better serve modern maritime uses, and to provide for public access and use of the waterfront property.  Properly developed, the Aloha Tower complex will further serve as a stimulant to the commercial activities of the downtown business community and help transform the waterfront into a "people place."</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature finds and determines that the purpose of this chapter is in the public interest and constitutes a valid public purpose. [L 1981, c 236, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 146, §1; am L 1988, c 356, §1]</P>
