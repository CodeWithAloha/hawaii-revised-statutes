<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§206X-1  Findings and purpose.  </B>Tourism has been and probably will remain the mainstay of Hawaii's economy.  Although prospects for the tourism industry appear to be excellent for the foreseeable future, the legislature finds that certain steps should be taken to ensure this continued vitality.  The legislature finds and declares that the construction of a world- class convention center facility would strengthen Hawaii's economy by expanding its market size to convention-going visitors.</P>
<P>&#9;Conventioneers, because they spend more money per day than other visitors, are exceedingly desirable guests.  An added benefit is that most conventions are normally held during the traditional tourist off-season.  This influx of convention dollars during the normal tourist off-season results in greater year<B>-</B>round economic stability for all Hawaii.</P>
<P>&#9;The existing convention facilities in Hawaii are inadequate for the needs of many convention groups and, therefore, Hawaii has not been able to attract this segment of the market.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature declares that the convention center facility should be located to best address the needs of prospective conventioneers.  Toward this end, a survey of potentially appropriate sites both in Waikiki; and other areas in the State needs to be undertaken, from which the legislature may select the most appropriate site.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature finds that this project would best be served by the establishment of a new state corporate supervisory agency.  The fundamental objective of this agency would be to supervise and regulate the development of a convention center facility.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature acknowledges that private and public sector cooperation is critical to the feasibility and success of a convention facility.  To this end, the legislature believes that the State should invite convention facility development proposals from developers and enter into appropriate agreements covering their undertaking of the development and financing of a convention facility for the State, in consideration for land use, zoning, and other benefits for development and construction accruing to the site pursuant to the convention center development plan as adopted under this chapter.
