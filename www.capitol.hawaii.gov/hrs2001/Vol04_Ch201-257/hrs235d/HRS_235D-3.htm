All claims for a tax credit under this chapter shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the initial taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit. [L 1999, c 306, pt of §1]</P>
