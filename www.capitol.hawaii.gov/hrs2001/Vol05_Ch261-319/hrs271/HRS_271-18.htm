<P>  As this chapter contains no provisions regarding dormancy, and "public convenience and necessity" is not a prerequisite to transfer of certificates of public convenience and necessity pursuant to subsection (d), the public utilities commission was not required to permit intervenor carriers to argue those issues in proceedings regarding carrier's transfer applications.  93 H. 45, 995 P.2d 776.</P>
<P>  Where the public utilities commission acted within its prerogatives in treating bankrupt carrier's application as a request to permit other carriers to continue bankrupt carrier's existing service, and in doing so considered the public interest factors required under §271-1 and this section, §271-12 and the new service doctrine were inapposite to the case.  93 H. 45, 995 P.2d 776.</P>
