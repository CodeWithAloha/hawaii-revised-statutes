</B>
<P>&#9;<B>[§269-101]  Definitions.</B>  As used in this part:</P>
<P>&#9;"Eligible customer-generator" means a metered residential or commercial customer of an electric utility who owns and operates a solar, wind turbine, biomass, or hydroelectric energy generating facility, or a hybrid system consisting of two or more of these facilities, with a capacity of not more than ten kilowatts, that is:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Located on the customer's premises;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Operated in parallel with the utility's transmission and distribution facilities;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;In conformance with the utility's interconnection requirements; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer's own electrical requirements.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;"Net energy metering" means measuring the difference between the electricity supplied through the electric grid and the electricity generated by an eligible customer-generator and fed back to the electric grid over a monthly billing period; provided that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Net energy metering shall be accomplished using a single meter capable of registering the flow of electricity in two directions;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;An additional meter or meters to monitor the flow of electricity in each direction may be installed with the consent of the customer-generator, at the expense of the electric utility, and the additional metering shall be used only to provide the information necessary to accurately bill or credit the customer-generator, or to collect solar, wind turbine, biomass, or hydroelectric energy generating system performance information for research purposes;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If the existing electrical meter of an eligible customer-generator is not capable of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions, the electric utility shall be responsible for all expenses involved in purchasing and installing a meter that is able to measure electricity flow in two directions;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;If an additional meter or meters are installed, the net energy metering calculation shall yield a result identical to that of a single meter; and</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;An eligible customer-generator who already owns an existing solar, wind turbine, biomass, or hydroelectric energy generating facility, or a hybrid system consisting of two or more of these facilities, is eligible to receive net energy metering service in accordance with this part.
