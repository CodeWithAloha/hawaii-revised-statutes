<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Public and private expenditures will be reduced by increases in ridesharing, particularly in maintenance and construction costs for highways.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Increased energy consumption, air pollution, traffic congestion, and motor vehicle parking constitute a serious problem in the State, particularly in urban areas, and ridesharing is a cost-effective alternative approach for solving these problems.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The increased use of ridesharing will contribute to conservation of fuel, improvement of air quality, and more effective use of existing streets, highways, and parking facilities.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Ridesharing constitutes one of the most cost-effective and energy-efficient means of transportation.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Many employees work in and commute to the downtown area of Honolulu where the problems associated with traffic congestion, parking, energy consumption, and air pollution are greatest.</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;It is in the public interest and a public purpose for private industry, cities, counties, and the State to encourage people to use alternatives to single occupant motor vehicles, such as ridesharing. [L 1986, c 90, §1]</P>
