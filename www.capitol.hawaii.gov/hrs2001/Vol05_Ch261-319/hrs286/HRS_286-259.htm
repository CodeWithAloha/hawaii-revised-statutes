<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;There existed reasonable suspicion to stop the motor vehicle, the motor vehicle was stopped at an intoxication and drug control roadblock established and operated in compliance with sections 286-162.5 and 286-162.6, or the person was tested pursuant to section 286-163;</P>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The evidence proves by a preponderance that the arrestee drove, operated, or was in actual physical control of the motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or while having an alcohol concentration of .08 or more or that the arrestee refused to submit to a breath or blood test after being informed of the sanctions of this part.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(f)  In addition to subsection (e), the director shall affirm the administrative revocation of the registration of all motor vehicles owned by or registered to the arrestee only if the director determines that the arrestee is a repeat intoxicated driver.  If the director affirms the administrative revocation pursuant to this subsection, the director shall order the arrestee to surrender the license plates and motor vehicle registrations of all motor vehicles owned by or registered to the arrestee.  The director may destroy any license plates seized from or surrendered by the arrestee.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  The arrestee's prior alcohol enforcement contacts shall be entered into evidence.</P>

If a continuance is granted at the request of the arrestee, the director shall not extend the validity of the temporary driver's permit or temporary motor vehicle registration, if applicable.  For purposes of this section a continuance means a delay in the commencement of the hearing or an interruption of a hearing that has commenced other than for recesses during the day or at the end of the day or week.</P>
<P>&#9;(l)  The director may grant a special motor vehicle registration, pursuant to section [286-263.6], to a qualified household member or co-owner of any motor vehicle upon determination that the person is dependent on the motor vehicle for the necessities of life.
