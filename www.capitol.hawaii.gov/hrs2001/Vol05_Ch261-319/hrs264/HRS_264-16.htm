<P>&#9;The director of transportation may, from time to time, make advances to the clearing accounts from the state highway fund or from any moneys appropriated or otherwise made available to the department.  The advances shall be in such amounts as may be required to meet the obligations of the department which are authorized by the legislature.</P>
<P>&#9;As soon as practicable after an expenditure from a clearing account, a determination shall be made of the proper fund or appropriation to which the expenditure should be charged.  The fund or account from which funds are advanced shall thereupon be reimbursed out of the proper fund or appropriation. [L 1979, c 166, §1]</P>
