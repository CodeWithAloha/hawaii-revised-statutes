The board of regents may provide in the resolution or resolutions that all revenue bonds of the same issue shall be equally and ratably secured without priority by reason of number, date, or maturity of the bonds, date of sale, execution, or delivery thereof.  Any pledge of revenues contained in any resolution or resolutions adopted under this chapter shall be valid and binding from and after the adoption of the resolution or resolutions without physical delivery of the revenues therein pledged or the necessity of any further action by the State or the board, or any officer or agent of either the State or board.
