The coupons pertaining to the revenue bonds shall be executed with the lithographed or engraved facsimile signatures of the chairperson and executive officer of the board.  Revenue bonds bearing the signature of officers in office at the date of the signing thereof shall be valid and binding obligations, notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof and payment therefor any or all of the persons whose signatures appear thereon shall have ceased to be officers.  The validity of the bonds shall not be dependent on nor affected by the validity or regularity of any proceedings relating to the construction or maintenance of the university project or projects or university system or systems for which the bonds were issued.  The resolution authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds may provide that the bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this chapter, which recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance.
