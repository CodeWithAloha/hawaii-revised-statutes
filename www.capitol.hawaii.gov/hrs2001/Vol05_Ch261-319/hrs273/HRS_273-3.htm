<P>&#9;It may make, in, upon, across, under, or over any such lands, or any street, roads, ways, railroads, tramways, hills, valleys, rivers, canals, watercourses, or waters, such temporary or permanent inclined planes, tunnels, cuttings, embankments, aqueducts, bridges, roads, ways, passages, conduits, drains, piers, arches, fences, and other work and conveniences as it thinks proper;</P>
<P>&#9;It may alter the course of any rivers not navigable, canals, brooks, streams, or watercourses during such times as is necessary for constructing or maintaining tunnels, bridges, or other works over, under, or affecting the same; and may temporarily or permanently alter the course of any rivers or streams, or raise or sink the level of any rivers or streams, streets, roads, or ways, to carry more conveniently the same over or under or by the side of any railway;</P>
<P>&#9;It may make drains or conduits into, through, or under any lands adjoining the railway for the purpose of conveying water from or to the railway, and upon the railway, or any lands adjoining or near thereto;</P>
<P>&#9;It may make such piers, jetties, stations, sidings, wharves, warehouses, tollhouses, and other houses, yards, engines, machinery, signal posts, and other apparatus, works, and conveniences whatsoever connected with the railway as the corporation may think proper, and may from time to time alter, repair, or discontinue any such apparatus, works, and conveniences, and substitute others in their stead;</P>
<P>&#9;It may fell or remove any timber or other trees being within two hundred feet from either side of the railway which, by their liability to fall or otherwise, might obstruct or injure the railway;</P>
<P>&#9;It may also fell or cut down and remove any trees or wood, whether timber or other trees, or scrub or underwood, which, by reason of the line making a curve or otherwise, may obstruct or impede a view of any signal post from any portion of the line which shall be within one mile in a right line from any such signal post;</P>
<P>&#9;It may enter upon and use any existing private road, being a road graveled or formed with stones or other hard material, and not being an avenue or approach to any dwelling house;</P>
<P>&#9;It may enter upon and take, purchase, and hold all such lands, tenements, and hereditaments as may be required for the purposes of the railway and works connected therewith;</P>
<P>&#9;It may do all other things necessary or convenient for making, maintaining, altering, or repairing and using the railway.</P>
