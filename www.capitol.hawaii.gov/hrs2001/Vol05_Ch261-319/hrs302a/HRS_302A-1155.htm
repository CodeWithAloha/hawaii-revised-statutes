<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§302A-1155  Provisional entrance to school.</B>  (a)  A child may enter school provisionally upon submitting written documentation from a licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or an authorized representative of the department of health stating that the child is in the process of receiving the required immunizations.  Further documentation showing that the required immunizations have been completed shall be submitted to the appropriate school official no later than three months after the child first entered the school.  If all of the required immunizations cannot be completed within three months due to the length of the minimum intervals between doses of a particular vaccine required by the department of health, provisional admission may be extended so long as the child's parent or guardian provides documentation that appointments for required immunizations have been made and that progress toward completing the immunizations continues in accordance with the requirements of the department of health.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Provisional entrance to school may be suspended by the department of health when there is danger of an epidemic from any of the communicable diseases for which immunization is required. [L 1996, c 89, pt of §2; am L 1997, c 217, §1; am L 1998, c 60, §2; am L 2000, c 109, §2]</P>
