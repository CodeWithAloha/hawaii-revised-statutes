<P>The director shall not issue a conditional license permit to a respondent whose license, during the conditional license permit period, is expired or is suspended or revoked as a result of action other than the instant revocation for which the respondent is requesting a conditional license permit under this section.</P>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A sworn statement from the respondent's employer establishing that the employer will, in fact, discharge the respondent if the respondent is prohibited from driving.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  A request made pursuant to subsection (a)(2) shall be accompanied by a sworn statement by the respondent attesting to the specific facts upon which the request is based, which statement shall be verified by the director.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A conditional license permit may include restrictions allowing the respondent to drive:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Only for specified purposes or to specified destinations.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In addition, the director may impose any other appropriate restrictions.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The duration of the conditional license permit shall be determined on the basis of the criteria set forth in subsections (b) and (c).</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  If the respondent violates the conditions imposed under this section, the conditional license permit shall be rescinded, and administrative revocation shall be immediate for the appropriate period authorized by law. [L 2000, c 189, pt of §23; am L 2001, c 157, §23]</P>
