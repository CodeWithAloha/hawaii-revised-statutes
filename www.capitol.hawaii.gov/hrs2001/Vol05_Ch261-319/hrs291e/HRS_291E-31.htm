<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<B><P>Decisions under prior law (Chap. 286, Pt. XIV).</P>
</B><P>  Administrative revocation of driver's license law is constitutional because arrestee's due process rights are fully protected; administrative revocation program was applied in constitutional manner to each appellant.  75 H. 1, 856 P.2d 1207.</P>
<P>  Administrative revocation program did not violate article V, §6 of Hawaii constitution; placement of program within judiciary did not violate separation of powers doctrine.  76 H. 380, 878 P.2d 719.</P>
<P>  Where information conveyed to defendant regarding defendant’s rights under this chapter was inaccurate and misleading, defendant was precluded from knowingly and intelligently consenting to the blood alcohol test in violation of this chapter; trial court thus properly suppressed blood test results in defendant’s criminal DUI prosecution.  92 H. 45, 987 P.2d 268.</P>
<P>  Article VI, §1 and article V, §6 of the Hawaii constitution, neither separately nor together prohibit the establishment of the administrative driver’s license revocation office in the judiciary.  91 H. 212 (App.), 982 P.2d 346.</P>
