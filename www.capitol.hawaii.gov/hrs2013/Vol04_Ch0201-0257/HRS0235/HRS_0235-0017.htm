<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §235&#8209;17  Motion picture, digital
media, and film production income tax credit.</b>  <i>[Repeal and reenactment
on January 1, 2016.  L 2006, c 88, §4(2).]</i>  (a)  Any law to the contrary
notwithstanding, there shall be allowed to each taxpayer subject to the taxes imposed
by this chapter, an income tax credit which shall be deductible from the
taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the
taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.  The amount of the credit
shall be:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Fifteen per cent of the qualified production
costs incurred by a qualified production in any county of the State with a
population of over seven hundred thousand; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Twenty per cent of the qualified production costs
incurred by a qualified production in any county of the State with a population
of seven hundred thousand or less.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>A qualified production occurring in more than one
county may prorate its expenditures based upon the amounts spent in each
county, if the population bases differ enough to change the percentage of tax
credit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In the case of a partnership, S corporation,
estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for qualified production costs
incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The cost upon which the tax
credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level.  Distribution and
share of credit shall be determined by rule.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If a deduction is taken under section 179 (with
respect to election to expense depreciable business assets) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, no tax credit shall be allowed for those
costs for which the deduction is taken.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The basis for eligible property for
depreciation of accelerated cost recovery system purposes for state income
taxes shall be reduced by the amount of credit allowable and claimed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The credit allowed under this section
shall be claimed against the net income tax liability for the taxable year. 
For the purposes of this section, &quot;net income tax liability&quot; means
net income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this
chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the tax credit under this section
exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of credits over
liability shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided that no refunds or
payment on account of the tax credits allowed by this section shall be made for
amounts less than $1.  All claims, including any amended claims, for tax
credits under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth
month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed. 
Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the
right to claim the credit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  To qualify for this tax credit, a
production shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Meet the definition of a qualified production
specified in subsection (l);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Have qualified production costs totaling at least
$200,000;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Provide the State, at a minimum, a shared-card,
end-title screen credit, where applicable;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Provide evidence of reasonable efforts to hire
local talent and crew; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Provide evidence of financial or in-kind
contributions or educational or workforce development efforts, in partnership
with related local industry labor organizations, educational institutions, or
both, toward the furtherance of the local film and television and digital media
industries.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  On or after July 1, 2006, no qualified
production cost that has been financed by investments for which a credit was
claimed by any taxpayer pursuant to section 235-110.9 is eligible for credits
under this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  To receive the tax credit, the taxpayer
shall first prequalify the production for the credit by registering with the
department of business, economic development, and tourism during the
development or preproduction stage.  Failure to comply with this provision may
constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The director of taxation shall prepare
forms as may be necessary to claim a credit under this section.  The director
may also require the taxpayer to furnish information to ascertain the validity
of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary
to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Every taxpayer claiming a tax credit under
this section for a qualified production shall, no later than ninety days
following the end of each taxable year in which qualified production costs were
expended, submit a written, sworn statement to the department of business,
economic development, and tourism, identifying:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  All qualified production costs as provided by
subsection (a), if any, incurred in the previous taxable year;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The amount of tax credits claimed pursuant to
this section, if any, in the previous taxable year; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The number of total hires versus the number of
local hires by category (i.e., department) and by county.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  The department of business, economic
development, and tourism shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Maintain records of the names of the taxpayers
and qualified productions thereof claiming the tax credits under subsection
(a);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Obtain and total the aggregate amounts of all
qualified production costs per qualified production and per qualified
production per taxable year; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Provide a letter to the director of taxation
specifying the amount of the tax credit per qualified production for each
taxable year that a tax credit is claimed and the cumulative amount of the tax
credit for all years claimed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Upon each determination required under this
subsection, the department of business, economic development, and tourism shall
issue a letter to the taxpayer, regarding the qualified production, specifying
the qualified production costs and the tax credit amount qualified for in each
taxable year a tax credit is claimed.  The taxpayer for each qualified
production shall file the letter with the taxpayer's tax return for the
qualified production to the department of taxation.  Notwithstanding the
authority of the department of business, economic development, and tourism
under this section, the director of taxation may audit and adjust the tax credit
amount to conform to the information filed by the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  Total tax credits claimed per qualified
production shall not exceed $8,000,000.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  Qualified productions shall comply with
subsections (d), (e), (f), and (h).</p>
