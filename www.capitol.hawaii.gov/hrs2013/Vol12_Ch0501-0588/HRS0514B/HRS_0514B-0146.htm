automatic lien that arises pursuant to this subsection or the declaration or
bylaws.  Any proceedings to enforce an association's lien for any assessment
shall be instituted within six years after the assessment became due; provided
that if the owner of a unit subject to a lien of the association files a

association's lien shall be tolled until thirty days after the automatic stay

mediation, either party may file for arbitration under section 514B&#8209;162;
