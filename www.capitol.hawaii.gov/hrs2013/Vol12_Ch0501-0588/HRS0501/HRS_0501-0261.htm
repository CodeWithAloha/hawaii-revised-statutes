<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §501-261  Deregistration of fee interests.  </b>(a) 
The registered owner of the fee interest in registered land may submit a
written request to the assistant registrar to deregister the land under this
chapter.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Any written request for deregistration shall
include proof of title insurance in the amount of the value of the land to be
deregistered and a written waiver of all claims against the State relating to
the title to the land arising after the date of deregistration.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Upon presentation to the assistant registrar of a
written request for deregistration by the registered owner of the fee interest
in registered land, the assistant registrar shall not register the same, but
shall:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Record in the bureau of conveyances,
pursuant to chapter 502, the current certificate of title for the fee interest
in the registered land; provided that prior thereto, the assistant registrar
shall note on the certificate of title all documents and instruments that have
been accepted for registration and that have not yet been noted on the
certificate of title for the registered land;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Record in the bureau of conveyances,
pursuant to chapter 502, the written request for deregistration presented to
the assistant registrar for filing or recording.  The request shall be recorded
immediately after the certificate or certificates of title; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Cancel the certificate of title.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (3)  The registrar or assistant registrar shall note
the recordation and cancellation of the certificate of title in the
registration book and in the records of the application for registration of the
land that is the subject of the certificate of title.  The notation shall state
the bureau of conveyances document number for the certificate of title so
recorded, the certificate of title number, and the land court application
number, map number, and lot number for the land that is the subject of the
certificate of title so recorded.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (4)  No order of court shall be required prior to or in
connection with the performance of any of the foregoing actions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>    (b)  The certificate of title for each fee time
share interest shall be canceled effective as of the date and time of
deregistration of such fee time share interest.  Notwithstanding the provisions
of section 501-261 in existence prior to July 1, 2012, a fee time share
interest for which a certificate of title was not recorded in the bureau of
conveyances pursuant to chapter 502 and part II of this chapter prior to July
1, 2012, shall be deregistered on July 1, 2012, at 12:01 a.m.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Beginning on July 1, 2012, and continuing for so
long as shall be reasonably necessary in the ordinary course of business, the
assistant registrar shall:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Note on the certificate of title for each
fee time share interest all documents and instruments affecting the fee time
interest:</p>

<p class=iClause>              (i)  That were or are registered as of a date
and time prior to the date and time of deregistration of the fee time share
interest; and</p>

<p class=iClause>             (ii)  That were not yet noted on the certificate
of title of the fee time share interest as of the date and time of
deregistration thereof; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Certify each certificate of title. </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Section 501-196 shall apply to a certificate of
title updated pursuant to paragraph (1) upon approval of the same by the
assistant registrar, which approval shall be evidenced by a certification of
the assistant registrar endorsed upon the certificate of title.  A certificate
of title for a fee time share interest, including but not limited to a
certificate of title recorded prior to July 1, 2012, pursuant to part II of
this chapter 501, shall not be considered completed or approved, and shall be
subject to modification by the assistant registrar, at any time prior to
certification thereof by the assistant registrar.  Subsequent to the
certification, the certificate of title for a fee time share interest may only
be modified pursuant to section 501-196 or as otherwise provided in this
chapter.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Upon certification of the certificate of title
for a fee time share interest by the assistant registrar, the assistant
registrar shall mark the certificate of title &quot;canceled&quot;, note the
cancellation of the certificate of title in the registration book, and notify
the court of the cancellation.  Regardless of the date upon which such
administrative acts are performed, the cancellation of the certificate of title
for a fee time share interest shall be effective as of the date and time of
deregistration of that fee time share interest.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  If only part of the land described in the
certificate of title consists of a fee time share interest, then upon the
petition of the registered owner of that portion of the registered land not
constituting a fee time share interest, a new certificate of title shall be
issued to such owner for that portion of the registered land not constituting a
fee time share interest.  If registered land is held in the condominium form of
ownership, then for purposes of this subsection each unit for which a separate
certificate of title has been issued shall be treated as if it were a separate
parcel of registered land.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Except as provided in paragraph (4), no order of
court shall be required prior to or in connection with the performance of any
of the foregoing actions. [L 2009, c 120, pt of §2; am L 2012, c 121, §4]</p>
