one-time once a month payroll payment to all public officers and employees to
effect a conversion to after-the-fact payroll as follows:</p>

weekday.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>The implementation of the after-the-fact payroll
shall not be subject to negotiation under chapter 89.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If an employee has been working for the
State for at least six months, has no paid leave accumulated, and has an

the same pay dates and for the same pay periods as non-salaried employees.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Upon accumulation of eighty hours of paid leave,

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=XNotes><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>  District court did
not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary
injunction, where court granted a preliminary injunction against operation of
Act 355, L 1997 (which amended this section), State's &quot;pay lag&quot; law,
on the ground that it impaired the obligations of the employees' collective
bargaining agreement in violation of the contract clause of the U.S.
Constitution.  183 F.3d 1096.</span></p>

<p class=XNotes><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>  Plaintiffs' motion
for a preliminary injunction granted, where plaintiffs filed motion seeking to
enjoin defendants from delaying payroll under Act 355, L 1997 (which amended
this section), with respect to University of Hawaii faculty members, arguing
that Act 355 violated the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution because a
five-day delay in pay violated the collective bargaining agreement between the
State and the faculty members at the University.  16 F. Supp. 2d 1242.</span></p>

<p class=XNotes><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>  Where there was no
existing contract that Act 355, L 1997 (amending this section), impaired, no
contracts clause violation possible and injunction no longer needed; the case
was moot.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.</span></p>

<p class=XNotes><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>  Based upon the
legislative history of this section, and where it could not be said that the
objective of Act 355, L 1997, which was to balance the state budget by amending
this section, was not achieved, the specific implementation dates set forth in
this section were mandatory.  111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.</span></p>

<p class=XNotes><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>  The Act 355, L 1997
amendment to this section, which essentially altered the dates when public
employees are to be paid, did not violate article XIII, §2 of the Hawaii
constitution nor chapter 89 inasmuch as they did not prohibit a state employer
from changing the pay dates of its employees; thus, the Act 355 amendment was
not unconstitutional.  111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.</span></p>

<p class=XNotes><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>  Where plaintiffs
failed to demonstrate that bargaining over pay dates was one of the core
subjects of collective bargaining that triggers a violation of article XIII, §2
of the Hawaii constitution, and failed to provide the supreme court with their
collective bargaining agreement to support their contention that pay dates are
bargainable, and these pay dates were not specifically incorporated into their
contract, the Act 355, L 1997 amendment to this section to unilaterally alter
the &quot;traditional practice&quot; of being paid on the fifteenth day and
last day of the month did not violate their right to collectively bargain pay
periods.  111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.</span></p>
