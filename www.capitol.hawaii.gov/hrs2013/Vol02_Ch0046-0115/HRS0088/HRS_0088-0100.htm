<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[</b><b>§88-100]  Payment by employers of
costs associated with significant non-base pay increases.  </b>(a)<b>  </b>The
contribution payable in each year to the pension accumulation fund by the State
and each county shall include the actuarial present value, as determined by the
system, of the excess maximum retirement allowance, payable over the employee's
or former employee's actuarial life expectancy, resulting from significant
non-base pay increases for each employee or former employee who became a member
of the system prior to July 1, 2012.  The additional contributions required by
this section shall be payable as provided in subsection (e).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The last employer of the employee or
former employee shall pay the additional contributions required by this
section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  An excess maximum retirement allowance
resulting from significant non-base pay increases occurs when:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The employee's or former employee's average
non-base pay, divided by the employee's or former employee's average base pay,
is greater than ten per cent; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The employee's or former employee's average final
compensation non-base pay ratio divided by the comparison period non-base pay
ratio is greater than or equal to one-hundred twenty per cent.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The amount of the &quot;excess maximum
retirement allowance resulting from significant non-base pay increases&quot; is
the amount by which an employee's or former employee's maximum retirement
allowance exceeds what the employee's or former employee's maximum retirement
allowance would be if the employee's or former employee's average final
compensation was equal to the employee's or former employee's average base pay
multiplied by the sum of one and the employee's or former employee's comparison
period non-base pay ratio.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The additional contributions required by
this section shall be payable in a lump sum in the fiscal year following the
fiscal year in which the employee or former employee retired; provided that, if
the additional contributions required for the employees or former employees who
retire in a fiscal year are greater than ten per cent of the employer's
contributions (excluding the additional contributions) to the pension
accumulation fund for that fiscal year, the employer may pay the additional
contributions over a period of three fiscal years in installments equal to no
less than one-third of the original amount of the required additional
contributions, plus interest on the unpaid balance, commencing on the first day
of the fiscal year following the retirement of the employees or former employees,
at an annual rate equal to the investment yield rate assumption for actuarial
valuations of the system. [L 2012, c 153, §5]</p>
