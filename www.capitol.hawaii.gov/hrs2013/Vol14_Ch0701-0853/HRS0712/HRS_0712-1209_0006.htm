<p class=1Paragraph>     (b)  A severe form of trafficking as defined in Title

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §712-1209.6</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>Act 216, Session Laws 2012, added this section to: 
(1) authorize a person convicted of committing the offense of prostitution to
file a motion to vacate the conviction under certain circumstances; and (2)
establish procedures for the motion to vacate the conviction.  The legislature
found that human trafficking, consisting of the subjugation, recruitment,
harboring, or transportation of people for the purpose of forced labor or
services, or commercial sexual exploitation, was one of the fastest growing
criminal industries.&nbsp; Act 216 would assist in combating human trafficking
by allowing trafficking victims who were forced into prostitution to file a
motion to have their prostitution convictions vacated from their records.
