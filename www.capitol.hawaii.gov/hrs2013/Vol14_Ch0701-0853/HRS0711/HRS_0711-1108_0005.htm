<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1108.5</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 114, Session Laws 2007, created the offense of cruelty to
animals in the first degree, making it a felony to intentionally or knowingly
torture, mutilate, or poison or cause the torture, mutilation, or poisoning of
any pet animal resulting in serious bodily injury or death of the pet animal. 
The legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must be
not tolerated in our society.  Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse
and the commission of violent acts against humans.  Hawaii is only one of nine
states in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal
abuse.  The legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional
bond and relationship with their owners and family members and friends. 
Violence and harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional
impact on their owners and family.  The felony provisions of Act 114 protected
pet animals.  Conference Committee Report No. 29.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 111, Session Laws 2008, amended this section by making an
offense involving serious bodily injury or death to an equine animal a class C
felony, thus extending to equine animals some of the legal protections accorded
to pet animals relating to animal cruelty.  The legislature believed that horses
belong under the protection of law and that adding equine animals to the list
of animals protected under the animal cruelty law reflects the fact that
companion animals come in all shapes and sizes.  House Standing Committee
Report No. 1589-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2879, Conference
Committee Report No. 20-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 135, Session Laws 2011, amended this section to include
killing or attempting to kill any pet animal belonging to another person
without first obtaining legal authority or the consent of the pet animal's
owner, except for the humane euthanasia of an animal in accordance with
American Veterinary Medical Association accepted standards or conduct that the
actor believes necessary to avoid an imminent harm or evil to the actor, another
person, or an animal.  The legislature found that the existing language of this
section did not expressly address any method of killing a pet animal other than
torture, mutilation, or poisoning.  The legislature believed that the loophole
should be closed for several reasons.  The killing of a pet animal for sport
was not only abhorrent, but this type of aggressive behavior has wider
implications.  Animal abuse has connections to the abuse of family members and
may increase aggressive or violent tendencies in children who witness their
pets being abused or killed.  There were concerns that animal abuse or killing
perpetuates the cycle of violence because people who commit acts of serious
animal abuse frequently have histories of, or future tendencies toward, violent
crimes against humans.  By expressly making the killing of a pet animal a
criminal offense, the legislature intended to deter this conduct and its grave
effects.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 559, Conference Committee Report
No. 29.</p>
