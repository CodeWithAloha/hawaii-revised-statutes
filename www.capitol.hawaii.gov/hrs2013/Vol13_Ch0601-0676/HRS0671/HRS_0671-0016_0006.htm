<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §671-16.6  Submission of inquiry to an
alternative dispute resolution provider.</b>  (a)  Any inquiry initially filed
with the medical inquiry and conciliation panel may be subsequently submitted
to an alternative dispute resolution provider upon the written agreement of all
of the parties and with the written approval of the director of commerce and
consumer affairs.  The director shall approve the alternative dispute
resolution provider and the alternative dispute resolution procedures.  All
filing fees, less a processing fee of $50, shall be refunded to the appropriate
parties if the panel was not constituted or had not taken any action related to
the inquiry prior to the submission of the inquiry to an alternative dispute
resolution provider.  If the panel was constituted or took any action prior to
the submission of the inquiry to an alternative dispute resolution provider,
the remaining balance of any filing fees shall be refunded to the appropriate
parties, less a processing fee of $50 and a pro-rata amount to be determined by
the director.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The parties shall comply with the
procedures established by the alternative dispute resolution provider and
approved by the director.  If a party does not comply with those procedures,
any other party may file a motion with the director to have the inquiry
resubmitted to the medical inquiry and conciliation panel.  The director may
collect any filing fees that were refunded pursuant to subsection (a) from a
party that resubmits its inquiry.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Notwithstanding section 671-12, any
inquiry may be submitted directly to an alternative dispute resolution process
upon the written agreement of all parties without first submitting the inquiry
to a medical inquiry and conciliation panel.  A written agreement shall be effective
as of the date of its execution by the parties.  Any inquiry submitted directly
to alternative dispute resolution need not be subsequently submitted to a
medical inquiry and conciliation panel and shall not be subject to filing fees
assessed by the director for the medical inquiry and conciliation panel.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Within thirty days after the completion of
the alternative dispute resolution process, the alternative dispute resolution
provider shall notify all parties concerned, their counsel, and the representative
of each health care provider's liability insurance carrier authorized to act
for the carrier, as appropriate, that the alternative dispute resolution
process has been completed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The party submitting the inquiry may
institute litigation based upon the inquiry in an appropriate court only if:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The parties were not able to resolve the entire
matter through the alternative dispute resolution process and the matter has
not been resubmitted to the medical inquiry and conciliation panel pursuant to
subsection (b) of this section; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The matter has not been resolved through the
alternative dispute resolution process after twelve months from the date the
matter was filed with the approved or agreed upon alternative dispute
resolution provider.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  No statement made in the course of the
approved or agreed upon alternative dispute resolution process shall be
admissible in evidence as an admission, to impeach the credibility of a
witness, or for any other purpose in any trial of the action.  No decision,
conclusion, finding, or recommendation of the approved or agreed upon
alternative dispute resolution provider on the issue of liability or on the
issue of damages shall be admitted into evidence in any subsequent trial, nor
shall any party to the approved or agreed upon alternative dispute resolution
hearing, their counsel, or other representative of the party, refer or comment
thereon in an opening statement, in an argument, or at any time, to the court
or jury. [L 2003, c 211, §2; am L 2012, c 296, pt of §4]</p>
