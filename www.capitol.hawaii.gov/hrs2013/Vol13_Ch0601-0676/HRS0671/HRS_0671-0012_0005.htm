<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§671-12.5  Certificate of consultation.</b> 
(a)  Any inquiry filed with the medical inquiry and conciliation panel under
this chapter shall be accompanied by a certificate that declares one of the
following:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  That the party initiating the inquiry or the party's
attorney has consulted with at least one physician who is licensed to practice
in this State or any other state, and who is knowledgeable or experienced in
the same medical specialty as the health care professional against whom the
inquiry is made, and that the party or the party's attorney has concluded on
the basis of the consultation that there is a reasonable and meritorious cause
for filing the inquiry.  If the party initiating the inquiry or the party's
attorney is not able to consult with a physician in the same medical specialty
as the health care professional against whom the inquiry is made, that party or
the party's attorney may consult with a physician who is licensed in this State
or in any other state who is knowledgeable and experienced in a medical
specialty that is as closely related as practicable to the medical specialty of
the health care professional against whom the inquiry is made.  The physician
or physicians consulted may not be a party to the inquiry, nor be compelled to
testify or otherwise participate in proceedings related to the medical inquiry
and conciliation panel;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  That the party initiating the inquiry or the
party's attorney was unable to obtain the consultation required by paragraph
(l) because a statute of limitations would impair the action and that the
certificate required by paragraph (1) could not be obtained before the
impairment of the action.  If a certificate is executed pursuant to this
paragraph, the certificate required by paragraph (1) shall be filed by the
party initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney within ninety days after
filing the inquiry; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  That the party initiating the inquiry or the
party's attorney was unable to obtain the consultation required by paragraph
(1) after the party or the party's attorney had made a good faith attempt to
obtain the consultation and the physician contacted would not agree to the
consultation.  For purposes of this paragraph, &quot;good faith attempt&quot;
refers to the responsibility of a party initiating an inquiry or the party's
attorney to make reasonable efforts to contact a physician for the purpose of
reviewing the circumstances upon which an inquiry is based.  The party
initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney may contact physicians by
letter, telephone, facsimile, or other electronic means of communication.  If
the physician does not respond within a reasonable time, the party initiating
the inquiry or the party's attorney may submit the inquiry to the medical
inquiry and conciliation panel along with a certificate declaring the
nonresponse to the party or the party's attorney's good faith attempt.  A
&quot;good faith attempt&quot; shall ultimately be evaluated in light of the
goal of having a qualified physician assist the party initiating the inquiry or
the party's attorney in understanding the basis of the inquiry and the
determination shall depend upon the circumstances of each individual case.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Where a party initiating an inquiry or the
party's attorney intends to rely solely on a failure to inform of the
consequences of a procedure (informed consent), this section shall be
inapplicable.  The party initiating an inquiry or the party's attorney shall
certify upon filing of the inquiry that the party or the party's attorney is
relying solely on the failure to inform of the consequences of a procedure and
for that reason is not filing a certificate as required by this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  For the purposes of this section, the
party initiating an inquiry or the party's attorney shall not be required to
disclose the names of any physician consulted to fulfill the requirements of
subsection (a) to any of the other parties to the inquiry.  The medical inquiry
and conciliation panel may require the party initiating an inquiry or the
party's attorney to disclose the name of any physician consulted to fulfill the
requirements of subsection (a).  No disclosure of the name of any physician
consulted to fulfill the requirements of subsection (a) shall be made to any of
the other parties to the inquiry; provided that the medical inquiry and
conciliation panel may contact the physician to determine if the requirements
of subsection (a) were met.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Unless a certificate is filed pursuant to
subsection (a) or (b), the inquiry shall not be received for filing by the
medical inquiry and conciliation panel. [L 2003, c 211, §1; am L 2012, c 296,
pt of §4]</p>
