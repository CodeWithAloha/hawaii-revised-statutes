<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>PART I. 
GENERAL PROVISIONS</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Note</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sections 669-1 to 669-8 designated as Part I by L 1997, c
131, §3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§669-1  Object of action.</b>  (a)  Action
may be brought by any person against another person who claims, or who may
claim adversely to the plaintiff, an estate or interest in real property, for
the purpose of determining the adverse claim.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Action for the purpose of establishing
title to a parcel of real property of five acres or less may be brought by any
person who has been in adverse possession of the real property for not less
than twenty years.  Action for the purpose of establishing title to a parcel of
real property of greater than five acres may be brought by any person who had
been in adverse possession of the real property for not less than twenty years
prior to November 7, 1978, or for not less than earlier applicable time periods
of adverse possession.  For purposes of this section, any person claiming title
by adverse possession shall show that such person acted in good faith.  Good
faith means that, under all the facts and circumstances, a reasonable person
would believe that the person has an interest in title to the lands in question
and such belief is based on inheritance, a written instrument of conveyance, or
the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Action brought to claim property of five
acres or less on the basis of adverse possession may be asserted in good faith
by any person not more than once in twenty years, after November 7, 1978.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Action under subsection (a) or (b) shall
be brought in the circuit court of the circuit in which the property is
situated.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Action may be brought by any person to
quiet title to land by accretion; provided that no action shall be brought by
any person other than the State to quiet title to land accreted along the ocean
after May 20, 2003, except that a private property owner whose eroded land has
been restored by accretion may also bring such an action for the restored
portion.  The person bringing the action shall prove by a preponderance of the
evidence that the accretion is natural and permanent and that the land accreted
before or on May 20, 2003.  The person bringing the action shall supply the
office of environmental quality control with notice of the action for publication
in the office's periodic bulletin in compliance with section 343-3(c)(4).  The
quiet title action shall not be decided by the court unless the office of
environmental quality control has properly published notice of the action in
the office's periodic bulletin.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     As used in this section, &quot;permanent&quot;
means that the accretion has been in existence for at least twenty years.  The
accreted portion of land shall be considered within the conservation district. 
Land accreted after May 20, 2003, shall be public land except as otherwise
provided in this section.  Prohibited uses are governed by section 183-45. [L

<p class=XNotes>  Where claimant failed to rebut presumption that claimant's

<p class=XNotes>  Appeals court erred in determining that summary judgment was
proper in quiet title action for subject property where, viewed in the light
most favorable to defendants, there were genuine issues of material fact as to
whether a cotenancy existed among plaintiff and defendants and, if a cotenancy
did exist, whether plaintiff acted in good faith towards its cotenant.  114 H.

<p class=XNotes>  Article XVI, §12, of the Hawaii constitution does not bar
adverse possession claims to more than five acres of land where claim matured
prior to November 7, 1978; this section is a reasonable construction of article
XVI, §12.  91 H. 545 (App.), 985 P.2d 1112.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Claimant established prima facie case of adverse possession
where claimants built, operated and leased slaughterhouse for over fifty years,
erected signs designating property, and placed and maintained fences around
property.  91 H. 545 (App.), 985 P.2d 1112.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Publicly recorded conveyances evidencing the existence of a

to suspect the cotenancy's existence not objectively reasonable.  91 H. 545
(App.), 985 P.2d 1112.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where earliest point at which plaintiffs' alleged
