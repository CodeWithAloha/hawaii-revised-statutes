<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     </span><b><span lang=X-NONE>§667-81 
Outcome of dispute resolution; neutral's closing report.  </span></b><span
lang=X-NONE>(a)  Within ten days from</span><span lang=X-NONE> the conclusion
of the dispute resolution, the neutral shall file a closing report with the
department, which verifies the parties' presence at the session, compliance
with the requirements of this part, and reports whether the parties reached an
agreement to resolve the dispute and the date of the dispute resolution's
conclusion.  Upon receipt of the neutral's closing report, the department shall
close the case.  The department shall forward a written copy of the neutral's
closing report by registered or certified mail to the parties within five days
after receipt from the neutral.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     </span><span lang=X-NONE>(b) 
If, despite the parties' participation in the dispute resolution process and compliance
with the requirements of this part, the parties are not able to come to an
agreement, the neutral shall file a closing report with the department that the
parties met the program requirements.  The mortgagee may record the report. 
Upon recording of the report pursuant to this subsection, the foreclosure
process shall resume along the timeline as it existed on the date before the
mortgagor elected dispute resolution, and may proceed as otherwise provided by
law.  The mortgagee shall notify the mortgagor of the recording date and
document number of this report and the deadline date to cure default in an
amended foreclosure notice.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
require the neutral to wait the full sixty days allotted for dispute resolution
to determine that the parties were unable to reach an agreement and file a
report.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the parties have complied with the
requirements of this part and have reached an agreement, the agreement shall be
memorialized in writing and signed by the parties or their authorized
representatives.  The parties shall be responsible for drafting any agreement
reached and enforcing the agreement.  The agreement shall be a contract between
the parties and shall be enforceable in a private contract action in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction in the event of breach by either party.  If the
agreement allows for foreclosure or other transfer of the subject property, the
stay of the foreclosure under section 667-83 shall be released upon the
recordation of the neutral's closing report.  Thereafter, the office of the
assistant registrar of the land court or bureau of conveyances may record a
notice of sale or other conveyance document, as appropriate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If the parties to a dispute resolution
process reach an agreement which resolves the matters at issue in the dispute
resolution before the first day of the scheduled dispute resolution session
scheduled pursuant to this section, the parties shall notify the neutral by
that date.  The neutral shall thereafter issue a closing report that the
parties have reached an agreement prior to the commencement of a dispute
resolution session.  If the agreement provides for foreclosure, the parties
shall memorialize the agreement in writing, which shall be signed by both parties. 
The parties may record the report.  If the agreement authorizes foreclosure,
the stay of the foreclosure under section 667-83 shall be released upon the
recordation of the report.  Thereafter, the land court or bureau of conveyances
may record a notice of sale or other conveyance document, as appropriate.  No
fees shall be refunded if the parties come to an agreement prior to a dispute
resolution session conducted pursuant to this part. <span lang=X-NONE>[L 2011,
