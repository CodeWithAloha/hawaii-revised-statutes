<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     [§302D-12]</b>  <b>Charter school governing
boards; powers and duties.  </b>(a)  No more than thirty per cent of the
members of a governing board shall be employees of a school or relatives of
employees of a school under the jurisdiction of that governing board; provided
that the chief executive officer, chief administrative officer, executive
director, or otherwise designated head of a charter school may serve as an ex
officio, non-voting member of the governing board.  In selecting members,
consideration shall be given to persons who:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Provide the governing board with a diversity of
perspective and a level of objectivity that accurately represent the interests
of the charter school students and the surrounding community;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Demonstrate an understanding of best practices of
non-profit governance; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Possess strong financial and academic management
and oversight abilities, as well as human resource and fundraising experience.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  No employee of a charter school or
relative of an employee of a charter school may serve as the chair of the
governing board of that charter school; provided that an authorizer may grant
an exemption from the provisions of this subsection based upon a determination
by the authorizer that an exemption is in the best interest of the charter
school.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The governing board shall be the
independent governing body of its charter school and shall have oversight over
and be responsible for the financial, organizational, and academic viability of
the charter school, implementation of the charter, and the independent
authority to determine the organization and management of the school, the
curriculum, virtual education, and compliance with applicable federal and state
laws.  The governing board shall ensure its school complies with the terms of
the charter contract between the authorizer and the school.  The governing
board shall have the power to negotiate supplemental collective bargaining
agreements with the exclusive representatives of their employees.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Governing boards shall be exempt from
chapter 103D, but shall develop internal policies and procedures for the
procurement of goods, services, and construction, consistent with the goals of
public accountability and public procurement practices.  Governing boards and
charter schools are encouraged to use the provisions of chapter 103D wherever
possible; provided that the use of one or more provisions of chapter 103D shall
not constitute a waiver of the exemption from chapter 103D and shall not
subject the charter school to any other provision of chapter 103D.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Charter schools and their governing boards
shall be exempt from the requirements of chapters 91 and 92.  The governing
boards shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Make available the notices and agendas of public
meetings:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  At a publicly accessible area in the
governing board's office and the authorizer's office so as to be available for
review during regular business hours; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  On the governing board's or charter
school's internet website, if applicable, and the authorizer's internet website
not less than six calendar days prior to the public meeting, unless a waiver is
granted by the authorizer or authorizer's designee in the case of an emergency;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Make available the minutes from public meetings
within thirty days and maintain a list of the current names and contact
information of the governing board's members and officers:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  In the governing board's office and the
authorizer's office so as to be available for review during regular business
hours; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  On the governing board's or charter
school's internet website, if applicable, and the authorizer's internet
website.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  All charter school employees and members
of governing boards shall be subject to chapter 84.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The State shall afford the governing board
of any charter school the same protections as the State affords the board.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  For purposes of this section,
&quot;employees&quot; shall include the chief executive officer, chief
administrative officer, executive director, or otherwise designated head of a charter
school. [L 2012, c 130, pt of §2]</p>
