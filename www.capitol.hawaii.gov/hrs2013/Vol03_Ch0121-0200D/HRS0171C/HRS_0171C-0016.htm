<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§171C-16]  Transfer of public lands.</b> 
(a)  Notwithstanding chapter 171 or any provision of this chapter to the
contrary, the department may transfer, subject to the approval of the board of
land and natural resources, development rights for lands under its jurisdiction
to the corporation for purposes of this chapter; provided that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Development rights for all small boat harbors
that have an existing contract in force and effect relating to a lease or
development agreement, or a request for proposal that has been advertised or is
under negotiation for capital improvements to harbor facilities as of July 1,
2011, shall be transferred to the corporation on July 1, 2011; provided that
with regard to any:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Request for proposal that has been issued
for which a contract has not been executed; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Contract executed by the department that
is in force and effect,</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>          on the effective date of this section that
relates to the development or redevelopment of submerged or fast lands of a
small boat harbor under the control of the department, if the public land
corporation is not fully operational by July 1, 2011, the department shall
continue to execute its responsibilities relating to negotiating or executing a
contract for any such request for proposal or managing any existing contract
until the corporation is able to assume the negotiating, oversight, and
management responsibilities relating to the existing contract or request for
proposal, as the case may be, or until June 30, 2013, whichever occurs first;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  If the property to be developed is two hundred
acres or less and the board of land and natural resources approves the transfer
of development rights appurtenant to the property to be developed, the
development rights shall be transferred to the corporation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  If the property to be developed is greater than
two hundred acres and the board of land and natural resources approves the
transfer of development rights appurtenant to the property to be developed, the
development rights shall be transferred to the corporation, subject to
disapproval by the legislature by two-thirds vote of either the senate or the
house of representatives or by majority vote of both houses in any regular or
special session next following the date of transfer; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The size of any property to be developed shall be
deemed to be conclusively determined by the state surveyor, as established in
section 26-6.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If the corporation finds that state lands
under the control and management of the department or other public agencies are
suitable for its purposes under this chapter, the corporation may lease the
lands from the agency having the control and management of those lands, upon
such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the parties.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Notwithstanding subsection (b) to the
contrary, no public lands shall be leased to the corporation if the lease would
impair any covenant between the State or any county, or any department or board
thereof, and the holders of bonds issued by the State or the county, or any
department or board thereof. [L 2011, c 55, pt of §1]</p>
