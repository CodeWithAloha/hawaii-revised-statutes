<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§481B-14  Hotel or restaurant service
charge; disposition.]</b>  Any hotel or restaurant that applies a service
charge for the sale of food or beverage services shall distribute the service
charge directly to its employees as tip income or clearly disclose to the
purchaser of the services that the service charge is being used to pay for
costs or expenses other than wages and tips of employees. [L 2000, c 16, §2]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>This section is not preempted by the federal Fair
Labor Standards Act regulations; further, this section is not
unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process; moreover, this section
did not deny defendant hotel and resort employer due process because it did not
automatically transform the service charges in question into the property of
plaintiff hotel employees, who sought unpaid wages, because it permitted
defendant the option of disclosing to customers that the service charges would
not be paid to employees.  810 F. Supp. 2d 1145.</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>This section requires hotels and restaurants to pay
service charges to employees as tip income if they do not disclose their
contrary practice to customers; to the extent that the legislative history of
this section is relevant to the question of whether employees may sue for
unpaid wages under §388-6 based on violations of this section, that legislative
history, as interpreted by the Hawaii Supreme Court, provides support for the
idea that employees may do so.  810 F. Supp. 2d 1145.</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>Defendant resort's motion to dismiss plaintiff resort
employees' claim that defendant violated this section, brought under §480-2(a),
granted where plaintiffs' allegations did not show the nature of the
competition or demonstrate that plaintiffs have suffered an antitrust injury;
Hawaii's requirement that a plaintiff assert the nature of the competition was
designed to serve the same purpose as the federal requirement that a plaintiff
assert an antitrust injury.  818 F. Supp. 2d 1240.</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>Plaintiff resort employees' claim, brought under
§480-2(a), that defendant resort violated this section was not preempted by
§301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §185(a), because the
claim regarding this section was a statutory claim that was independent from
any obligations created under the collective bargaining agreement (agreement)
between defendant and plaintiffs; further, resolution of the claim did not
require interpretation of the agreement and there was no clear and explicit
waiver of plaintiffs' rights under this section in the agreement.  818 F. Supp.
2d 1240.</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>Plaintiff resort employees' claim that defendant
resort violated this section was not preempted by the National Labor Relations
Act pursuant to the Machinists doctrine because it is not the type of statute
that the Machinists doctrine was intended to preempt as it does not present the
types of concerns enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in Machinists;
further, this section had no comparable effect on the bargaining process;
moreover, this section provides a minimum protection for employees as well as
consumer protection.  818 F. Supp. 2d 1240.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Employees are &quot;any persons&quot; within the meaning of
§§480-1 and 480-2(e) and are within the category of plaintiffs who have
standing to bring a claim under §480-2(e) for a violation of this section;
however, based on the allegations contained in employees' amended complaint,
employees did not sufficiently allege the &quot;nature of the competition&quot;
to bring a claim for damages against employer under §§480-2(e) and 480-13(a)
for a violation of this section.  122 H. 423, 228 P.3d 303.</p>
