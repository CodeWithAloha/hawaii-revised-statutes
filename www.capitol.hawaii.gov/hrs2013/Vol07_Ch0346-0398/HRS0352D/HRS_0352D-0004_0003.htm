<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Except as otherwise specified, any

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The office may require the contracted

of the contracted provider or subcontractor has been convicted of an offense
for which incarceration is a sentencing option; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The office finds that the criminal history record
of the employee, prospective employee, or volunteer of the contracted provider
or subcontractor indicates that the employee, prospective employee, or
volunteer may pose a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of youth
receiving direct services by that employee, prospective employee, or volunteer.</p>
