lang=X-NONE>  Initiation of proceeding for involuntary medical treatment.</span></b><span
lang=X-NONE>  (a)  The director, or the director's designee, may file a
petition for involuntary medical treatment alleging that a person in the
custody of the department meets the criteria for involuntary medical treatment
under section 353-13.6.  The petition shall be executed subject to the
penalties of perjury but need not be sworn to before a notary public and shall
be filed in the circuit court of the circuit wherein the person who is the subject
of the petition is in custody.  The attorney general, the attorney general's
deputy, special deputy, or appointee designated to present the case shall
assist the petitioner to state the substance of the petition in plain and
simple language.  The petition may be accompanied by an affidavit of the
licensed physician or psychologist who has examined the person within two days
prior to submission of the petition, unless the person whose treatment is
sought has refused to submit to a medical or psychological examination, in
which case the fact of refusal shall be alleged in the petition.  The affidavit
shall set forth the signs and symptoms relied upon by the physician or
psychologist to determine whether the person is in need of treatment, whether
the person is capable of realizing and making a rational decision with respect
to the person's need for treatment, and the recommended treatment.  If the
petitioner believes that further evaluation is necessary before treatment, the
petitioner may request such further evaluation.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (b)  If the person has been
given an examination, evaluation, or treatment in a psychiatric facility or by
the department within five days before the filing of the petition, and
treatment is recommended by the staff of the facility or the department, the
petition may be accompanied by an affidavit of the department's medical
director or the mental health administrator in lieu of a physician's or
psychologist's affidavit. [L 2011, c 72, pt of §2]</span></p>
