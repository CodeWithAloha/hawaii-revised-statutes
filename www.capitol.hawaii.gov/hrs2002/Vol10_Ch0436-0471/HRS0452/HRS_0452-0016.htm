These licenses may be renewed by filing an application therefor, accompanied by a renewal fee.  The application shall be made between May 1 and June 30 of each even-numbered year.  Failure to apply for renewal as provided in this section shall constitute a forfeiture of the license as of the date of expiration.  Any license so forfeited may be restored within one year after expiration upon the filing of an application in the same manner and payment of a penalty fee in addition to all delinquent fees.  Thereafter, the person shall apply as a new applicant and the board may require the person to take and pass the examination and satisfy all requirements for the examination, including training, if the board is not satisfied that the person possesses current knowledge and skills for the practice of massage therapy.
