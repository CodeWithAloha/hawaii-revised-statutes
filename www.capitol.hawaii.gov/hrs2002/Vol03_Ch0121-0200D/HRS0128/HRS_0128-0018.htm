The governor may insure vehicles owned by the State or in the custody and use of the civil defense agency, but insurance effected under section 41D-8 on vehicles used for purposes other than civil defense need not necessarily include coverage of the insured vehicle against the risk incurred or which would be incurred under this chapter as a result of the use of the insured vehicle for civil defense.</P>
