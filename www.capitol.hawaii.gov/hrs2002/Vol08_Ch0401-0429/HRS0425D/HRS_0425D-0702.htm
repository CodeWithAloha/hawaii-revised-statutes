An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any right of a partner.  An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled.  Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all that partner's partnership interest. [L 1989, c 288, pt of §1]</P>
