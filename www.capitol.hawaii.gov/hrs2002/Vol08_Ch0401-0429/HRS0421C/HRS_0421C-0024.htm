Unless otherwise provided, a member may be expelled and lose all rights and privileges in the association, by the vote of a majority of the directors voting at any validly held meeting of directors.  The member against whom the charges are to be proffered shall be informed thereof in writing at least ten days in advance of the meeting, and shall have an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel at such meeting.  On decision of the association to expel a member, the directors shall purchase the member's holdings at par or book value, whichever is less, if and when there are sufficient surplus funds.
