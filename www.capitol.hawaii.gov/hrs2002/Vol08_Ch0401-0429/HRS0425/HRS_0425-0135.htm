<P>&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(II)&#9;Though the other party had not so extended credit, had nevertheless known of the partnership prior to dissolution, and, having no knowledge or notice of dissolution, the fact of dissolution had not been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the place (or in each place if more than one) at which the partnership business was regularly carried on.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)&#9;Where the partner has no authority to wind up partnership affairs; except by a transaction with one who</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner's dissociation but without the partner's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.
