<P>&#9;(2)  A partner is discharged from any existing liability upon dissolution of the partnership by an agreement to that effect between himself, the partnership creditor and the person or partnership continuing the business; and such agreement may be inferred from the course of dealing between the creditor having knowledge of the dissolution and the person or partnership continuing the business.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  Where a person agrees to assume the existing obligations of a dissolved partnership, the partners whose obligations have been assumed shall be discharged from any liability to any creditor of the partnership who, knowing of the agreement, consents to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of such obligations.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)  The individual property of a deceased partner shall be liable for all obligations of the partnership incurred while he was a partner but subject to the prior payment of his separate debts. [L 1972, c 17, §36]</P>

<P>&#9;(b)  A statement of dissociation is a limitation on the authority of a dissociated partner for the purposes of section 425-114(a) and (b).</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  For the purposes of sections 425-134(a)(3) and 425-135(b)(3), a person not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissociation ninety days after the statement of dissociation is filed. [L 1999, c 284, pt of §1]</P>
