<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§412:4-107  Accounts of minors.  </B>A financial institution may open an account and accept deposits therein in the name of a minor in the same manner as for an adult and the deposit shall be held for the exclusive right and benefit of the minor, free from the control of any other person.  All relations between the financial institution and the minor shall be on the same basis as though the minor were an adult, and any payment, transfer or withdrawal made to or on the order of the minor shall operate to release and discharge the financial institution for the paid, transferred or withdrawn funds with respect to all persons, and any pledge of the account by the minor shall be valid.  Provided, however, that in case any guardian, conservator or trustee is appointed for the minor by a court having jurisdiction, the financial institution may pay over or credit to the guardian, conservator or trustee the deposit and interest or dividends pertaining thereto, and such payment or credit shall operate to release and discharge the financial institution from further liability to the guardian, conservator or trustee and to the minor with respect to the funds so paid or credited.  No action at law or equity may be maintained against the financial institution for payment, transfer, withdrawal or pledge made in accordance with this section. [L 1993, c 350, pt of §1]</P>
