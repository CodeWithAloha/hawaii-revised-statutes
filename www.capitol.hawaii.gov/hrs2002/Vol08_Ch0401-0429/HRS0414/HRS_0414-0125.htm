If a meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, the notice shall also inform shareholders of the means of remote communication by which shareholders may be deemed to be present in person and allowed to vote.  Unless this chapter or the articles of incorporation require otherwise, the corporation is required to give notice only to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Unless this chapter or the articles of incorporation require otherwise, notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Notice of a special meeting must include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If not otherwise fixed under section 414-123 or 414-127, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at an annual or special shareholders' meeting is the day before the first notice is delivered to shareholders.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Unless the bylaws require otherwise, if an annual or special shareholders' meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if the new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment.  In addition, if the annual or special shareholders' meeting was held solely by means of remote communication, and the adjourned meeting will be held by a means of remote communication by which shareholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote, notice need not be given of the new means of remote communication if the new means of remote communication is announced at the meeting before adjournment.  If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under section 414-127, however, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given under this section to shareholders who are entitled to notice of the new record date.
