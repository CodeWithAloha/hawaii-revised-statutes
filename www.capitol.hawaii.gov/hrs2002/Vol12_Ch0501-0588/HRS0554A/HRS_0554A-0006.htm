<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§554A-6]  Powers exercisable by joint trustees; liability.</B>  (a)  Any power vested in three or more trustees may be exercised by a majority, but a trustee who has not joined in exercising a power is not liable to the beneficiaries or to others for the consequences of the exercise; and a dissenting trustee is not liable for the consequences of an act in which the trustee joins at the direction of the majority of the trustees, if the trustee expressed a dissent in writing to any of the cotrustees at or before the time of the joinder. </P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If two or more trustees are appointed to perform a trust, and if any of them is unable or refuses to accept the appointment, or, having accepted, ceases to be a trustee, the surviving or remaining trustees shall perform the trust and succeed to all the powers, duties, and discretionary authority given to the trustees jointly. </P>
<P>&#9;(c)  This section does not excuse a cotrustee from liability for failure either to participate in the administration of the trust or to attempt to prevent a breach of trust. [L 1985, c 61, pt of §1]</P>
