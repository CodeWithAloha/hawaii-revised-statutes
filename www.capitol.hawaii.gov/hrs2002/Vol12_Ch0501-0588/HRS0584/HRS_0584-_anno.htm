<P>  Commission on fatherhood (repealed June 30, 2005).  L 2003, c 156.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  By their plain language, §§584-1 and 584-3 do not state that this chapter is the exclusive means by which paternity must be established; thus, this chapter is not the exclusive means by which a determination of paternity can be made.  99 H. 1, 52 P.3d 255.</P>
<P>  The enactment of this chapter: (1) does not displace the Hawaii supreme court's previous decision in Blackshear; (2) does not prevent a proper litigant in a paternity action from asserting defenses based upon res judicata and equitable estoppel; and, (3) a final judgment, including a divorce decree, can serve as the basis for such defenses.  99 H. 1, 52 P.3d 255.</P>
