<P>&#9;(c)  No board of directors or member of the board shall use association funds to solicit proxies except for the distribution of proxies as set forth in section 514A-82(b)(4); provided that this shall not prevent an individual member of the board from soliciting proxies as an apartment owner under section 514A-82(b)(4).</P>
