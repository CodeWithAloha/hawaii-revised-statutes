The family leave shall consist of unpaid leave, paid leave, or a combination of paid and unpaid leave.

<P>&#9;(c)  An employer who provides sick leave for employees shall permit an employee to use the employee's accrued and available sick leave for purposes of this chapter; provided that an employee shall not use more than ten days per year for this purpose unless an express provision of a valid collective bargaining agreement authorizes the use of more than ten days of sick leave for family leave purposes.
