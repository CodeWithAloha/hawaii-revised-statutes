<P>&#9;(b)  This section shall not apply to an individual who, pursuant to the teachings, faith, or belief of any group, depends for healing upon prayer or other spiritual means.  In that case the disability, the probable duration thereof, and any other pertinent facts required to be certified by regulation of the director shall be certified, in the form and manner specified by the regulation, by a duly authorized or accredited practitioner of such group.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The proof of disability duly certified by a person licensed to practice medicine, surgery, dentistry, chiropractic, osteopathy, or naturopathy, or an authorized or accredited practitioner of any group which depends for healing upon prayer or other spiritual means shall be submitted by such certifying person to the disabled employee within seven working days after the date on which the employee was examined and found disabled.  If the certifying person fails to submit the required proof within seven working days, the director, upon notification by the insurer, may levy a penalty of $25 for each delinquent certification where the certifying person fails to show good cause for the person's failure to file on time.
