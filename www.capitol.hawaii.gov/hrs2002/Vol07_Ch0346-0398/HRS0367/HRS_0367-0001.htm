<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§367-1  Findings and purpose.</B>  The legislature finds that the work of the state commission on the status of women, established by the governor by executive order on May 15, 1964, demonstrates the need for a continuing body to aid in the implementation of its recommendations, to develop long-range goals, and to coordinate research planning, programming, and action on the opportunities, needs, problems, and contributions of women in Hawaii.  It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for a statewide program, on a permanent and continuing basis, on the status of women in Hawaii. [L 1970, c 190, pt of §1; am L 2000, c 270, §2]</P>
