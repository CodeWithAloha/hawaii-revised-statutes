Without regard to chapter 91, the board may adopt as rules the compendia of therapeutically equivalent generic drugs as the state drug formulary of equivalent multiple source drug products.  The board may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to establish a Hawaii additions and deletions list; provided that section 328-92(c) shall apply, and no pharmacist shall substitute an equivalent generic drug product for any prescription for an anti-epileptic drug to treat epilepsy, except upon the consent of the practitioner and the patient or the patient's parent or guardian.  Upon the adoption of the compendia of therapeutically equivalent generic drugs by the board, the board shall notify all pharmacies in the State and other interested individuals, within thirty working days, that the formulary has been updated.  The Hawaii additions and deletions list may list additional substitutable drug products that are determined by the board to be safe, effective, and therapeutically equivalent.  The Hawaii additions and deletions list may delete drug products listed in the compendia of therapeutically equivalent generic drugs upon the board's finding that product quality or therapeutic equivalency or bioequivalency, as appropriate, is not adequately assured.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Pursuant to chapter 91, the Hawaii additions and deletions list may be changed, added to, or deleted from as the board deems appropriate.
