<P>&#9;(b)  For the purposes of this section, "developmental disabilities domiciliary homes" means any facility licensed under section 321-15.9 that provides twenty-four hour supervision or care, excluding licensed nursing care, for a fee, to not more than five adults with mental retardation or developmental disabilities as defined in this chapter; and "adult foster homes" shall be as defined under section 321-11.2.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  An applicant to operate an adult foster home or developmental disabilities domiciliary home and all current and prospective employees of the applicant shall be subject to criminal history record checks in accordance with section 846-2.7, and shall provide consent to the department to obtain criminal history record information for verification.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Each existing provider or provider and all employees hired after the initial licensure or certification of the existing provider or provider shall be subject to criminal history record checks in accordance with section 846-2.7, and shall provide consent to the department to obtain criminal history record information for verification.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The department is authorized to obtain criminal history record information through the Hawaii criminal justice data center on existing providers and their employees upon their next licensure or certification renewal date, and on any applicant and all current and prospective employees of the applicant, including all new employees after the applicant is issued a certification or license under this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Once fingerprints are on file, yearly licensure or certification renewals for providers and employees will require only state criminal history record checks through the Hawaii criminal justice data center.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  The department may revoke a current license or certification or deny an application for a license or certification to operate an adult foster home or developmental disabilities domiciliary home under rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 if the existing provider or employee of an existing provider, applicant, current or prospective employee of the applicant, provider, or new employee of the provider refuses to submit to the department statements indicating criminal convictions, refuses to provide consent to the department to conduct a criminal history record check or obtain other criminal history record information for verification, refuses to be fingerprinted, has been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation involving a fine of $50 or less; or if the department finds that the criminal history record of the existing provider or employee of an existing provider, applicant, current or prospective employee of the applicant, provider, or new employee of the provider may pose a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of persons with developmental disabilities or mental retardation living in the home.
