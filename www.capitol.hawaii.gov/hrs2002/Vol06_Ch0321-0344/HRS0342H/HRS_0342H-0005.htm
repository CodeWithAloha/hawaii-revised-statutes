<P>&#9;(b)  Each application for a variance shall be reviewed in light of the descriptions, statements, plans, histories, and other supporting information submitted with the application, such additional information as may be submitted upon the request of the department, and the effect or probable effect upon the standards established pursuant to this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Whenever an application for a variance is approved, the department shall issue a variance authorizing the disposal of solid waste in nonconformance with applicable standards or rules.  No variance shall be granted by the department unless the application and the supporting information clearly show that:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The disposal occurring or proposed to occur does not substantially endanger human health or safety; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Compliance with the applicable standards or rules from which variance is sought would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public.</P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;If the variance is granted on the ground that there is no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, control, or abatement of the solid waste pollution involved, it shall be only until the necessary means for prevention, control, or abatement become practicable and subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the department may prescribe.  No renewal of a variance granted under this subsection shall be allowed without a thorough review of known and available means of preventing, controlling, or abating the solid waste pollution involved;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The director may issue a variance for a period not exceeding five years; and</P>

<P>&#9;(e)  Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed from time to time on terms and conditions and for periods not exceeding five years which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance; provided that the applicant for renewal has met all of the conditions specified in the immediately preceding variance; and provided further that the renewal, and the variance issued in pursuance thereof, shall provide for a variance not greater than that attained pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding variance at its expiration.  No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor.  Any such application shall be made at least one hundred eighty days prior to the expiration of the variance.  The director shall act on an application for renewal within one hundred eighty days of the receipt of such application.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  The director may afford a hearing in accordance with chapter 91 in relation to an application for the issuance, renewal, or modification of a variance.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  No variance granted pursuant to this chapter shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of any emergency provisions and procedures provided by law.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  Any application for a variance submitted pursuant to this chapter, shall be subject to the following public participation requirements:</P><DIR>
