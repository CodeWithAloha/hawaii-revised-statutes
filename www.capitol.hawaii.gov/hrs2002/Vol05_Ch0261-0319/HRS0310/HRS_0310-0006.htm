For that purpose, the commission may negotiate and enter into arrangements and contracts with this State or any appropriate agency thereof, with public and private educational institutions and agencies, and with states and other governmental entities.  Such arrangements and contracts may provide for the obtaining of one or more places for students on either a special or continuing basis; the payment of partial or full tuition and other charges; and the furnishing of reciprocal, compensating or other advantages and benefits in support of the educational program involved.
