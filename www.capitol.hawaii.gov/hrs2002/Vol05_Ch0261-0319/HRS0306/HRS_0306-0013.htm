The rate or rates of interest borne by the refunding bonds shall not be affected or limited by the rate or rates of interest borne by the bonds to be refunded or the indebtedness to be funded.  All provisions of this chapter applicable to the issuance of revenue bonds shall be complied with in the issuance of refunding bonds.  Refunding bonds shall be sold as provided in section 306-4, or the board may, in its discretion, provide for the exchange of refunding bonds for a like principal amount of outstanding bonds for the refunding of which the issuance of such refunding bonds has been authorized, whether or not the interest rate on the refunding bonds is higher than the interest rate on the bonds refunded thereby.
