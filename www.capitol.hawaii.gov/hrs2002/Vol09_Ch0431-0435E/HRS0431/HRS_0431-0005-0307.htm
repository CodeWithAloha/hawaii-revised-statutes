<P>&#9;(b)  Reserve valuation:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The commissioner, annually, shall value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities, hereinafter called reserves, for all outstanding life insurance, annuity, and pure endowment contracts of every life insurer doing business in this State.  The commissioner may certify the amount of any reserves, specifying the mortality table or tables, rate or rates of interest, and methods (net level premium method or others) used in the calculation of the reserves.  In calculating the reserves, the commissioner may use group methods and approximate averages for fractions of a year or otherwise.  In lieu of the valuation of the reserves required under this section of any foreign or alien insurer, the commissioner may accept any valuation made, or caused to be made, by the insurance supervisory official of any state or other jurisdiction, when the valuation complies with the minimum standard under this section, and if the official of that state or jurisdiction accepts as sufficient and valid for all legal purposes the certificate of valuation of the commissioner when the certification states the valuation to have been made in a specified manner according to which the aggregate reserves would be at least as large as if they had been computed in the manner prescribed by the law of that state or jurisdiction;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The actual cost of making valuations under this section shall be assessed on the insurer, whose policies are so valued, by the commissioner; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Any insurer, at any time, that has adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, with the approval of the commissioner, may adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum provided in this section.</P></DIR>

</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;After June 1, 1976, any insurer may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1979, which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for the insurer; provided that an insurer may elect a different operative date for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts from that elected for group annuity and pure endowment contracts.  If an insurer makes no election, the operative date of this paragraph for the insurer shall be January 1, 1979; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Applicability of this section:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The interest rates used in determining the minimum for the valuation of:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;All life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year, on or after the operative date of section 431:10D-104(e)(8);</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;All individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year after December 31, 1982;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;All annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year after December 31, 1982, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iv)&#9;The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after 1982, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts shall be the calendar year statutory valuation rates as defined in this paragraph;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one per cent:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;For life insurance,</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;W</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;I = .03 + W (R<SUB>1</SUB> - .03) + (R<SUB>2</SUB> - .09);</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P> &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;2</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options,</P>

<P>&#9;I = .03 + W (R - .03)</P>

<P>&#9;where R<SUB>1</SUB> is the lesser of R and .09, R<SUB>2</SUB> is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this section, and W is the weighting factor defined in this section;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in clause (ii), the formula for life insurance stated in clause (i) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten years, and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in clause (ii) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of ten years or less;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iv)&#9;For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in clause (ii) shall apply; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(v)&#9;For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in clause (ii) shall apply;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one per cent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for those life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year.  For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined for 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when section 431:10D-104(e)(8) becomes operative;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated above are given in the following tables:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of twenty years.  For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.  Plan type as used in the above tables is defined as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P>Plan Type A:</U>  At any time the policyholder may withdraw funds only: (1) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; (2) without adjustment but in installments over five years or more; (3) as an immediate life annuity; or (4) no withdrawal permitted;</P>
<U><P>Plan Type B:</U>  Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, the policyholder may withdraw funds only: (1) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; (2) without adjustment but in installments over five years or more; or (3) no withdrawal permitted.  At the end of the interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without adjustment in a single sum or in installments over less than five years;</P>
<U><P>Plan Type C:</U>  The policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of the interest rate guarantee in a single sum or in installments over less than five years either: (1) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; or (2) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.</P>
<P>A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis.  Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options shall be valued on an issue year basis.  As used in this section, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(E)&#9;The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph (4)(B) shall be defined as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in clause (ii), with guarantee duration in excess of ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iv)&#9;For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in clause (ii), with guarantee duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(v)&#9;For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(vi)&#9;For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in clause (ii), the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; and</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(F)&#9;Alternative method for determining references interest rates: In the event that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or in the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by rules adopted by the commissioner, may be substituted.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  Commissioner's reserve valuation methods:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (h), reserves, according to the commissioner's reserve valuation methods, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor.  The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits (excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy) that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subparagraph (A) over subparagraph (B) as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one a year payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due; provided that the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age of issue of the policy; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;A net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year; provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year, and no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess, which provides an endowment benefit, a cash surrender value, or a combination thereof, in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve, according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date, defined herein as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium, except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), shall be the greater of the reserve as the policy anniversary calculated as described above and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described, but with:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;The value defined in subparagraph (A) being reduced by fifteen per cent of the amount of the excess first year premium;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;All present values benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;The policy being assumed to mature on that date as an endowment; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iv)&#9;The cash surrender value provided on that date being considered as an endowment benefit.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in subsection (c)(2) and (3) shall be used; and</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Reserve according to the commissioner's reserve valuation methods for:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;Accident and health or sickness and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this subsection.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  This subsection shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended.</P>
<P>&#9;Reserves according to the commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any accident and health or sickness and accidental death benefits in those contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by those contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of the contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year.  The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in the contracts for determining guaranteed benefits.  The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Minimum aggregate reserves:  In no event shall an insurer's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies excluding accident and health or sickness and accidental death benefits, issued on or after the operative date of section 431:10D-104, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections (d), (e), (h), and (i), and the mortality tables and rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for those policies.  In no event shall the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (j).</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  Optional reserves bases:  Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the commissioner, issued on or after the operative date of section 431:10D-104, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for the category than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided.  The rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be higher than the corresponding rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for therein.  Any company which at any time shall have adopted any standard valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, with the approval of the commissioner, may adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum herein provided; provided that for the purposes of this section, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (j) shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  Minimum reserve:  If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurer on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for that policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract using the minimum standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium.  The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this section are those standards stated in subsection (c)(1), (2), and (4); provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January&nbsp;1, 1986, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value, or a combination thereof, in an amount greater than the excess premium, this subsection shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for the policy were the method described in subsection (d), ignoring the second paragraph of that subsection.  The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection (d), including subsection (d)(2) and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.</P>
<P>&#9;(i)  In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (d), (e), and (h), the reserves which are held under any such plan must:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this section, as determined by rules adopted by the commissioner.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(j)  The actuarial opinion of reserves and this subsection shall become effective December&nbsp;31, 1995.</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Every life insurance company doing business in this State shall annually submit the opinion of a qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items held in support of the policies and contracts specified by the commissioner, by rules, are computed appropriately, are based on assumptions which satisfy contractual provisions, are consistent with prior reported amounts, and comply with the applicable laws of this State.  The commissioner, by rules, shall define the specifics of this opinion and add any other items deemed to be necessary to its scope;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Actuarial analysis of reserves and assets supporting the reserves:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Every life insurance company, except as exempted by or pursuant to rules, also shall include annually in the opinion required by paragraph (1), an opinion of the same qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items held in support of the policies and contracts specified by the commissioner by rules, when considered in light of the assets held by the company with respect to the reserves and related actuarial items, including but not limited to the investment earnings on the assets and the considerations anticipated to be received and retained under the policies and contracts, make adequate provision for the company's obligations under the policies and contracts, including but not limited to the benefits under, and expenses associated with, the policies and contracts; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The commissioner may provide, by rules, for a transition period for establishing any higher reserves which the qualified actuary may deem necessary in order to render the opinion required by this section;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Each opinion required by paragraph (2) shall be governed by the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;A memorandum, in form and substance acceptable to the commissioner as specified by rules, shall be prepared to support each actuarial opinion; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;If the insurance company fails to provide a supporting memorandum at the request of the commissioner within a period specified by rules or if the commissioner determines that the supporting memorandum provided by the insurer fails to meet the standards prescribed by rules or is otherwise unacceptable to the commissioner, the commissioner may engage a qualified actuary at the expense of the insurer to review the opinion and the basis for the opinion and prepare any supporting memorandum that is required by the commissioner; and</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Every opinion shall be governed by the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The opinion shall be submitted with the annual statement reflecting the valuation of reserve liabilities for each year ending on or after December&nbsp;31, 1995;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The opinion shall apply to all business in force including individual and group health insurance plans, in form and substance acceptable to the commissioner as specified by rules;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;The opinion shall be based on standards adopted from time to time by the Actuarial Standards Board and on any [additional] standards that the commissioner may prescribe by rules;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;In the case of an opinion required to be submitted by a foreign or alien insurer, the commissioner may accept the opinion filed by that insurer with the insurance supervisory official of another state if the commissioner determines that the opinion reasonably meets the requirements applicable to an insurer domiciled in this State;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(E)&#9;For the purposes of this section, "qualified actuary" means a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries who meets the requirements set forth in the regulations adopted by the American Academy of Actuaries;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(F)&#9;Except in cases of fraud or wilful misconduct, the qualified actuary shall not be liable for damages to any person, other than the insurer and the commissioner, for any act, error, omission, decision, or conduct with respect to the actuary's opinion; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(G)&#9;Any memorandum in support of the opinion, and any other material provided by the insurer to the commissioner in connection therewith, shall be kept confidential by the commissioner and shall not be made public and shall not be subject to subpoena, other than for the purpose of defending an action seeking damages from any person by reason of any action required by this section, or by rules adopted hereunder; provided that the memorandum or other material may otherwise be released by the commissioner with the written consent of the insurer or be released to the American Academy of Actuaries upon request stating that the memorandum or other material is required for the purpose of professional disciplinary proceedings and setting forth procedures satisfactory to the commissioner for preserving the confidentiality of the memorandum or other material.  Once any portion of the confidential memorandum is cited by the insurer in its marketing material or is cited before any governmental agency, other than a state insurance department, or is released by the insurer to the news media, all portions of the confidential memorandum shall no longer be confidential.
