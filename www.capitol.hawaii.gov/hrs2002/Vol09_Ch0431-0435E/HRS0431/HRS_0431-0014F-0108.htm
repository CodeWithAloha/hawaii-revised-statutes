<P>&#9;(b)  Whenever a managed care plan has no legally effective rates as a result of the commissioner's disapproval of rates or other act, interim rates shall be established as follows:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;In the event a filing is disapproved, in whole or in part, a petition and demand for a contested case hearing may be filed in accordance with chapter 91.  The managed care plan shall have the burden of proving that the disapproval is not justified.  While the action of the commissioner in disapproving the rate filing is being challenged, the aggrieved managed care plan shall charge the rates established or the filed rates, whichever is lower; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;In the event a filing is approved, a contested case hearing in accordance with chapter 91 may be convened pursuant to subsection (c) to determine if the approved rates comply with the requirements of this article.  If an appeal is taken from the commissioner's approval or if subsequent to the approval the commissioner convenes a hearing pursuant to subsection (c), the filing of the appeal or the commissioner's notice of hearing shall not stay the implementation of the rates approved by the commissioner, or the rates currently in effect, whichever is higher;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The commissioner may waive or modify the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2) if the application of those paragraphs will endanger the financial solvency of the managed care plan or the welfare of its enrollees.   The commissioner may also order that a specified portion of the premiums be placed in an escrow account approved by the commissioner.  When new rates become legally effective, the commissioner may order the escrowed funds or any change in interim rates to be refunded or allow the managed care plan to exact a surcharge on premiums, whichever applies.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  If at any time subsequent to the applicable review period provided for in section 431:14F-105, the commissioner finds that a filing does not comply with the requirements of this article, the commissioner shall order a hearing upon the filing.  The hearing shall be held upon not less than ten days' written notice to every managed care plan that made such a filing.  The notice shall specify the matters to be considered at the hearing.  If after a hearing the commissioner finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this article, the commissioner shall issue an order specifying in what respects the filing fails to meet the requirements, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing shall be deemed no longer effective.  Copies of the order shall be sent to each managed care plan.  The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the order.</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)&#9;(1)  Any person or organization aggrieved with respect to any filing which is in effect may make written demand to the commissioner for a hearing thereon; provided that the managed care plan which made the filing shall not be authorized to proceed under this subsection;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The demand shall specify the grounds to be relied upon by the aggrieved person or organization and the demand must show that the person or organization has a specific economic interest affected by the filing;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If the commissioner finds that the demand is made in good faith, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if the person's or organization's grounds are established, and that the grounds otherwise justify a hearing, the commissioner, within thirty days after receipt of the demand, shall hold a hearing.  The hearing shall be held upon not less than ten days' written notice to the aggrieved party and to every managed care plan which made the filing; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;If, after the hearing, the commissioner finds that the filing does not meet the requirements of this article, the commissioner shall issue an order specifying in what respects the filing fails to meet the requirements of this article, and stating when, within a reasonable period, the filing shall be deemed no longer effective.  Copies of the order shall be sent to the applicant and to every such managed care plan.  The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the order.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  The notices, hearings, orders, and appeals referred to in this section, in all applicable respects, shall be subject to chapter 91, unless expressly provided otherwise. [L 2002, c 74, pt of §2]</P>
