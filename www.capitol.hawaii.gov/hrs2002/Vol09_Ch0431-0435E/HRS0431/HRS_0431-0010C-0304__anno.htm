<P>  Section entitles motorcycle passenger to claim no-fault benefits against automobile driver's policy for passenger's injuries received in accident between driver's vehicle and motorcycle.  81 H. 302, 916 P.2d 1203.</P>
<P>  Term "any person" in paragraph (1)(A)(i) includes motorcycle passengers.  81 H. 302, 916 P.2d 1203.</P>
<P>  Paragraph (1)(B) (1987) created a statutory right to survivors' loss benefits.  88 H. 345 (App.), 966 P.2d 1071.</P>
<P>  Pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) (1987) and §431:10C-103(10)(B) (1987), upon the death of an insured, the insurer is obligated to provide the insured's survivor a survivor's loss benefit of up to either (1) $15,000 where the insured has purchased only the basic no-fault coverage, or (2) the expanded limits of no-fault benefits where the insured has contracted for it under an optional additional coverage.  88 H. 345 (App.), 966 P.2d 1071.</P>
<P>  The plain language of paragraph (1) requires a casual connection between a motor vehicle accident and any injury for which a claim for no-fault insurance benefits is made.  101 H. 21 (App.), 61 P.3d 532.</P>
<P>  Insurer violated the time requirements of paragraph (3)(C) (1993) when it delayed granting or denying insured's claim for no-fault benefits pending (1) receipt of answers from insured's treating physicians to insurer's questions regarding the underlying cause of the medical condition that required insured to undergo bypass surgery a few days after a motor vehicle accident, and (2) insured's undergoing two independent medical examinations; however, the commissioner wrongly concluded that insurer's violation of these time requirements procedurally barred insurer from contesting the substantive merits of insured's claim.  101 H. 311 (App.), 67 P.3d 810.</P>
