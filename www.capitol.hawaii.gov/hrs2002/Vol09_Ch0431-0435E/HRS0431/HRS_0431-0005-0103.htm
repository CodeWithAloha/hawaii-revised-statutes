<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>&#9;(a)&#9;(1)  A domestic reciprocal insurer's surplus shall be deemed to be impaired if its qualified assets are at any time insufficient to discharge its liabilities other than any liability on account of funds contributed by the attorney or other parties, and insufficient to maintain the surplus required for the classes of insurance it is authorized to transact.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Upon such impairment of a reciprocal insurer's surplus, its attorney shall forthwith levy an assessment upon subscribers made subject to assessment by the terms of their policies for the amount needed to make up the deficiency.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;For the purposes of a determination of impairment of a reciprocal under this section, surplus means the required surplus which corresponds to the paid-up capital stock required of a stock insurer for authority to transact a like class or classes of insurance.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  The insurer shall be deemed insolvent and shall be proceeded against as authorized by this code if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The attorney fails to make the assessment within thirty days after the commissioner orders the attorney to do so; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The deficiency is not fully made up within sixty days after the date the assessment was made.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  If liquidation of such an insurer is ordered, an assessment shall be levied upon the subscribers for such an amount, subject to limits as provided by this code, as the commissioner determines to be necessary to discharge all liabilities of the insurer, exclusive of any funds contributed by the attorney, but including the reasonable cost of the liquidation.
