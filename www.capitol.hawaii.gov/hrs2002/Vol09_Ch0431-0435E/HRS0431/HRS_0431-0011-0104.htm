<P>&#9;For purposes of this section, a domestic insurer includes any person controlling a domestic insurer unless the commissioner determines that the person, directly or through its affiliates, is primarily engaged in business other than the business of insurance.  Such a person shall file a preacquisition notification with the commissioner containing the information set forth in section 431:11-104.3(b) thirty days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition.  Failure to file is subject to section 431:11-104.5(f).  This section does not apply to any securities broker holding, in the usual and customary broker's function, less than twenty per cent of the voting securities of an insurance company or of any person who controls an insurance company.</P>

The description shall identify the persons with whom the contracts, arrangements, or understandings have been entered into;</P>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>If the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) is a partnership, limited partnership, or other group, the commissioner may require that the information called for by items (1) through (12) shall be given with respect to each partner of the partnership or limited partnership, each member of the group, and each person who controls such partner or member.  If any partner, member, or person is a corporation or the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) is a corporation, the commissioner may require that the information called for by items (1) through (12) shall be given with respect to the corporation, each officer and director of the corporation, and each person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than ten per cent of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation.</P>
<P>&#9;If any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the statement filed with the commissioner and sent to the insurer pursuant to this section, an amendment setting forth the change, together with copies of all documents and other material relevant to the change, shall be filed with the commissioner and sent to the insurer within two business days after the person learns of the change.

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)&#9;(1)&#9;The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsection (a) unless, after a public hearing thereon, the commissioner finds that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsection (a) would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this State or tend to create a monopoly therein;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;The financial condition of any acquiring party might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(E)&#9;The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(F)&#9;The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The public hearing referred to in paragraph (1) shall commence within sixty days after the statement required by subsection (a) is filed, except that the hearing may commence within such additional time as agreed to by the commissioner, the acquiring party and the person to be acquired, and at least twenty days notice of the scheduled public hearing shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement.  Not less than seven days notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to any other persons as may be designated by the commissioner.  The insurer shall give notice to its security holders.  The commissioner shall make a determination within thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing.  At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected thereby shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and in connection therewith shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in chapter 91.  All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than three days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The commissioner may retain at the acquiring person's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  All statements, amendments, or other material filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b), and all notices of public hearings held pursuant to subsection (d), shall be mailed by the insurer to its shareholders within five business days after the insurer has received the statements, amendments, other material, or notices.  The expenses of mailing shall be borne by the person making the filing.  As security for the payment of the expenses, the person shall file with the commissioner an acceptable bond or other deposit in an amount to be determined by the commissioner.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Any transaction which is subject to the provisions of article 4, dealing with the merger or consolidation of two or more insurers; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt therefrom as:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Not having been made or entered into for the purpose of, and not having the effect of, changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Not otherwise comprehended within the purposes of this section.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(g)  The following shall be violations of this article:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b); or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of, control of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless approval is given by the commissioner.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(h)  The courts of this State are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled or authorized to do business in this State who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and overall actions involving the person arising out of violations of this article.  Each person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by the person of the commissioner to be the person's true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of violations of this article.
