<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§431:14-117  Penalties.</B>  (a)  The commissioner, if the commissioner finds any person or organization has violated any provision of this article, may impose a penalty of not more than $500 for each violation, but if the commissioner finds the violation to be wilful the commissioner may impose a penalty of not more than $5,000 for each such violation.  The penalties may be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.  For purposes of this section, any insurer using a rate for which the insurer has failed to file the rate, supplementary rating information, underwriting rules or guides, or supporting information as required by this article, shall have committed a separate violation for each day such failure to file continues.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The commissioner may suspend the license of any rating organization or insurer which fails to comply with an order of the commissioner within the time limited by the order, or any extension thereof which the commissioner may grant.  The commissioner shall not suspend the license of any rating organization or insurer for failure to comply with an order until the time prescribed for an appeal from the order has expired or, if an appeal has been taken, until the order has been affirmed.  The commissioner may determine when a suspension of license shall become effective and it shall remain in effect for the period fixed by the commissioner unless the commissioner modifies or rescinds such suspension, or until the order upon which the suspension is based is modified, rescinded, or reversed.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No penalty shall be imposed and no license shall be suspended or revoked except upon a written order of the commissioner, stating the commissioner's findings, made after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice to the person or organization specifying the alleged violation. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 1990, c 255, §13]</P>
