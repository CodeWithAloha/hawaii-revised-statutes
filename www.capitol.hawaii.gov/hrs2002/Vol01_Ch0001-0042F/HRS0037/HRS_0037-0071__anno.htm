<P>  Current year's lapses not considered part of "total state resources".  Details of current year's lapses need not be set forth in supplemental appropriations bill and budget.  Att. Gen. Op. 83-4.</P>
<P>  Although express words "balanced budget" are not included in state constitution or statutes relating to state budget, constitutional and statutory provisions do require a balanced budget by requiring a description of proposed expenditures and sources of revenue to pay for them.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-1.</P>
<P>  Improper for biennial budget for fiscal biennium to incorporate as revenues proposed restrictions for fiscal year unless those restrictions were reflected as reduced appropriations in budget adopted legislatively for the fiscal year.  Appropriations for fiscal year that are restricted through allotment system are not "available resources" for purposes of budget preparation pursuant to this section.  Att. Gen. Op. 03-2.</P>
<P>  Restrictions imposed in one fiscal year cannot be counted as "available resources" for the next fiscal year.  Att. Gen. Op. 03-2.</P>
