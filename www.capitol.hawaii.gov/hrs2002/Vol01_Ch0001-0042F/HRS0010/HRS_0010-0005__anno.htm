<P>  Act 304, Session Laws of Hawaii 1990, was invalidated by its own severability clause when amendments made to §§10-2 and 10-13.5 by Act 304 were found to conflict with the federal Forgiveness Act (Pub. L. No. 105-66, §340, 111 Stat. at 1448), leaving court with no judicially manageable standards to determine whether office of Hawaiian affairs was entitled to the specific revenues sought in the suit.  96 H. 388, 31 P.3d 901.</P>
