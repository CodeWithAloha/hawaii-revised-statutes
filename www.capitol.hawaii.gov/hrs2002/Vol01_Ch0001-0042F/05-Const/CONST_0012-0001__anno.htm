</B>
<P>  Plaintiff challenging article XII insofar as it implemented Hawaiian Homes Commission Act lacked standing, where court was unable to redress plaintiff's injury as alleged in any meaningful way, in the absence of the United States as a party to the action.  188 F. Supp. 2d 1219.</P>
<P>  Hawaiian Homes Commission Act is part of Hawai`i constitution and does not constitute federal law; thus, federal preemption principles did not apply to case where there was no relevant federal law at issue and conflict between Act and state statute was matter of state constitutional law.  87 H. 91, 952 P.2d 379.</P>
