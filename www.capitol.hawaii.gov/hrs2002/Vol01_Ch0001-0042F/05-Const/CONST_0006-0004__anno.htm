</B>
<P>  Confidentiality requirement of rule 7 of the rules of the judicial selection commission does not apply to the governor or the chief justice after the judicial selection commission has submitted its lists of judicial nominees for consideration; it is within the sole discretion of appointing authorities whether to make public disclosure of the commission’s lists of judicial nominees.  75 H. 333, 861 P.2d 723.</P>
<P>  Section neither expressly mandates that lists containing the names of the judicial selection commission’s judicial nominees remain confidential nor that they be publicly disclosed.  Petitioner failed to meet burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that rule 7 of the rules of the judicial selection commission was a plain, clear, manifest, and unmistakable violation of this section.  75 H. 333, 861 P.2d 723.</P>
