Determinations of whether to insure or self-insure shall be made by the comptroller in conjunction with the state agency having custody or control of the vehicle, or the vehicle may be insured on a complete or excess coverage basis under a comprehensive automobile liability insurance policy entered into by the comptroller.  If the vehicles are self-insured, claims for which the State is liable under article 10C of chapter 431 may be settled and paid by the comptroller from the state risk management revolving fund, notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 662.  Any purchased state comprehensive automobile liability insurance policy shall be administered by and be subject to the control of the comptroller. [L 1988, c 266, pt of §1]</P>
