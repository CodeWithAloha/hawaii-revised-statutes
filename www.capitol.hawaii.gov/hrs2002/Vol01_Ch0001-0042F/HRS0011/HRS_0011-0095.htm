Such voter shall not because of such absence be liable to any penalty, nor shall there be any rescheduling of normal hours or any deduction made, on account of the absence from any usual salary or wages; provided that the foregoing shall not be applicable to any employee whose hours of employment are such that the employee has a period of two consecutive hours (excluding any lunch or rest periods) between the time of opening and closing the polls when the employee is not working for the employer.  If, however, any employee fails to vote after taking time off for that purpose the employer, upon verification of that fact, may make appropriate deductions from the salary or wages of the employee for the period during which the employee is hereunder entitled to be absent from employment.  Presentation of a voter's receipt by an employee to the employer shall constitute proof of voting by the employee.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Any person, business, or corporation who refuses an employee the privileges conferred by this section, or subjects an employee to a penalty or deduction of wages because of the exercise of the privileges, or who directly or indirectly violates this section, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $300.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Any action taken to impose or collect the fines established in this section shall be a civil action. [L 1970, c 26, pt of §2; am L 1976, c 106, §1(7); am L 1981, c 100, §1(1); am L 1998, c 236, §1]</P>
