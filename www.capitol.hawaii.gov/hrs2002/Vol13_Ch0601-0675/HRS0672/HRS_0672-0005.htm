<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§672-5  Design professional conciliation panel hearing; fact-finding; evidence; voluntary settlement.</B>  Every claim of a tort shall be heard by the design professional conciliation panel as soon as possible after the date for filing a response.  No persons other than the panel, witnesses, and consultants called by the panel, and the persons listed in section 672-6 shall be present except with the permission of the chairperson.  The panel may, in its discretion, conduct an inquiry of a party, witness, or consultant without the presence of any or all parties.</P>
<P>&#9;The hearing shall be informal.  The panel may require a stenographic record of all or part of its proceedings for the use of the panel, but such record shall not be made available to the parties.  The panel may receive any oral or documentary evidence.  Questioning of parties, witnesses, and consultants may be conducted by the panel, and the panel may, in its discretion, permit any party, or any counsel for a party to question other parties, witnesses, or consultants.  The panel may designate who, among the parties, shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence with respect to such issues as it may consider, and unless otherwise designated by the panel, when a design professional's records have been provided for the claimant's proper review, such burden shall initially rest with the claimant at the commencement of the hearing.</P>
<P>&#9;The panel shall have the power to require by subpoena the appearance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence.  When such subpoena power is utilized, notice shall be given to all parties.  The testimony of witnesses may be taken either orally before the panel or by deposition.  In cases of refusal to obey a subpoena issued by the panel, the panel may invoke the aid of any circuit court in the State, which may issue an order requiring compliance with the subpoena.  Failure to obey such order may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.  Any member of the panel, the director of the department, or any person designated by the director of the department may sign subpoenas.  Any member of the panel may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.  Notwithstanding such powers, the panel shall attempt to secure the voluntary appearance, testimony, and cooperation of parties, witnesses, and consultants without coercion.</P>
<P>&#9;At the hearing of the panel and in arriving at its opinion, the panel shall consider, but not be limited to, statements or testimony of witnesses, construction documents, inspection reports, calculations, and other records kept in the usual course of the practice of the design professional without the necessity for other identification or authentication, statements of fact, or opinion on a subject contained in a published treatise, periodical, book or pamphlet, or statements of experts without the necessity of the experts appearing at the hearing.  The panel may, upon the application of any party or upon its own decision, appoint as a consultant, an impartial and qualified architect, engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect or other professional person or expert to testify before the panel or to conduct any necessary professional or expert examination of the claimant or relevant evidentiary matter and to report to or testify as a witness thereto.  Such a consultant shall not be compensated or reimbursed except for travel and living expenses to be paid which may be incurred as a result of such person's appearance before the panel.  Such expenses shall be paid by the department of commerce and consumer affairs as provided in section 672-3.  Except for the production of documents and records kept in the usual course of the practice of an architect, engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect, discovery by the parties shall not be allowed.  Requests for production of documents shall be submitted to the chairperson of the panel for approval, denial, or modification, at the chairperson's sole discretion.</P>
<P>&#9;During the hearing and at any time prior to the rendition of an advisory decision pursuant to section 672-7, the panel may encourage the parties to settle or otherwise dispose of the case voluntarily.
