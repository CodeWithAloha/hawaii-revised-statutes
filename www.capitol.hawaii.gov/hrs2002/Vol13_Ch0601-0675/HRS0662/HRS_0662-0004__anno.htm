<P>  Supersedes §46-72 and Honolulu Charter §12-111.  55 H. 216, 517 P.2d 51; 56 H. 135, 531 P.2d 648.</P>
<P>  Only this section of this chapter is applicable to the city and county of Honolulu.  56 H. 241, 534 P.2d 489.</P>
<P>  Claim accrues when the plaintiff knew or should have known that an actionable wrong has been committed.  63 H. 117, 621 P.2d 957.</P>
<P>  Minority tolling not applicable.  72 H. 77, 806 P.2d 957.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff's lack of knowledge regarding a legal duty, the breach of which may have caused plaintiff's injury, did not justify application of "discovery rule"; plaintiff's failure to seek legal advice from an attorney did not toll statute of limitations.  81 H. 391, 917 P.2d 718.</P>
<P>  Continuing-tort exception, which tolls running of statute of limitations under this section, adopted; thus, where an actor continuously diverts water over which he or she has direct control onto another's land, and the diversion causes continuous and substantial damage to that person's property and the actor knows of this damage, such an act may present evidence of a continuous tort.  88 H. 241 (App.), 965 P.2d 783.</P>
