<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>Rule 611  Mode and order of interrogation and presentation.</B>  (a)  Control by court.  The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Scope of cross-examination.  Cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.  The court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Leading questions.  Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony.  Ordinarily, leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination.  When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions. [L 1980, c 164, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]</P>
