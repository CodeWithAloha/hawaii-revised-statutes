<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>Rule 302  Presumptions in civil proceedings.</B>  (a)  General rule.  In all civil proceedings not otherwise provided for by statute or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed either (1) the burden of producing evidence, or (2) the burden of proof.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Inconsistent presumptions.  If two presumptions are mutually inconsistent, the presumption applies that is founded upon weightier considerations of policy and logic.  If considerations of policy and logic are of equal weight neither presumption applies.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Applicability of federal law.  In all civil proceedings, the effect of a presumption respecting a fact which is an element of a claim or defense as to which federal law supplies the rule of decision is determined in accordance with federal law. [L 1980, c 164, pt of §1]</P>
