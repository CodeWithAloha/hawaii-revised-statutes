<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A "client" is a person who consults or is examined or interviewed by a psychologist. </P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A "psychologist" is a person authorized, or reasonably believed by the client to be authorized, to engage in the diagnosis or treatment of a mental or emotional condition, including substance addiction or abuse.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A communication is "confidential" if not intended to be disclosed to third persons other than those present to further the interest of the client in the consultation, examination, or interview, or persons reasonably necessary for the transmission of the communication, or persons who are participating in the diagnosis or treatment of the client's mental or emotional condition under the direction of the psychologist, including members of the client's family.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  General rule of privilege.  A client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of the client's mental or emotional condition, including substance addiction or abuse, among the client, the client's psychologist, and persons who are participating in the diagnosis or treatment under the direction of the psychologist, including members of the client's family.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Who may claim the privilege.  The privilege may be claimed by the client, the client's guardian or conservator, or the personal representative of a deceased client.  The person who was the psychologist at the time of the communication is presumed to have authority to claim the privilege but only on behalf of the client.</P>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Examination by order of court.  If the court orders an examination of the physical, mental, or emotional condition of a client, whether a party or a witness, communications made in the course thereof are not privileged under this rule with respect to the particular purpose for which the examination is ordered unless the court orders otherwise.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Condition an element of claim or defense.  There is no privilege under this rule as to a communication relevant to the physical, mental, or emotional condition of the client in any proceeding in which the client relies upon the condition as an element of the client's claim or defense or, after the client's death, in any proceeding in which any party relies upon the condition as an element of the party's claim or defense.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Proceedings against psychologist.  There is no privilege under this rule in any administrative or judicial proceeding in which the competency, practitioner's license, or practice of the psychologist is at issue, provided that the identifying data of the clients whose records are admitted into evidence shall be kept confidential unless waived by the client.  The administrative agency, board, or commission may close the proceeding to the public to protect the confidentiality of the client.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Furtherance of crime or tort.  There is no privilege   under this rule if the services of the psychologist were sought, obtained, or used to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan to commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or tort.</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Prevention of crime or tort.  There is no privilege under this rule as to a communication reflecting the client's intent to commit a criminal or tortious act that the psychologist reasonably believes is likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm.
