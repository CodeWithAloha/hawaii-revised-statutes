<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Domestic public documents not under seal.  A document purporting to bear the signature in the official capacity of an officer or employee of any entity included in paragraph (1), having no seal, if a public officer having a seal and having official duties in the district or political subdivision of the officer or employee certifies under seal that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Foreign public documents.
