<P>  Since filing notice of lis pendens under this section poses only a potential cloud on title, it is not an unconstitutional seizure of property without due process.  418 F. Supp. 695.</P>
<P>  Party may not invoke lis pendens where party's interest in land is only a percentage of the income derived from the use of land and there is no right to title or control of the land.  72 H. 267, 814 P.2d 396.</P>
<P>  Alleged equitable lien and filing of lis pendens not breach of covenant against encumbrances since lien was not actually in existence, valid, and enforceable at time of conveyance; a recorded lis pendens is an encumbrance.  75 H. 480, 866 P.2d 951.</P>
<P>  Where complainant does not claim title to or a right of possession of property, section not implicated and lis pendens should have been expunged.  75 H. 480, 866 P.2d 951.</P>
<P>  Where trial court's judgment in favor of defendant extinguished any claims plaintiff had against defendant and filing of appeal did not affect validity of the judgment being appealed from, lis pendens properly expunged as it was no longer based on "any action concerning real property".  92 H. 243, 990 P.2d 713.</P>
<P>  Where mortgagors' rights to property extinguished through foreclosure, that issue is res judicata.  4 H. App. 439, 667 P.2d 834.</P>
