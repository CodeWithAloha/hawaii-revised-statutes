<P>  Supreme court has jurisdiction to award reasonable attorneys' fees incurred on appeal, and supreme court may do so if requirements of HRAP rule 39(d) and this section are met; decisions about fees incurred at trial level more properly within trial court's discretion.  76 H. 396, 879 P.2d 501.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff's claim for specific enforcement of agreement was not action in assumpsit, trial court's denial of plaintiff's request for attorney's fees against defendant proper.  85 H. 19, 936 P.2d 655.</P>
<P>  Under this section, an action in the nature of assumpsit does not need a clause in writing providing for attorneys' fees in order for attorneys' fees to be granted.  86 H. 21, 946 P.2d 1317.</P>
<P>  Under this section, attorneys' fees may be awarded in three types of cases:  all actions in the nature of assumpsit; all actions on a promissory note; and contracts in writing that provide for an attorney's fee.  86 H. 21, 946 P.2d 1317.</P>

<P>  Where Oregon law firm did not "practice law within the jurisdiction" of Hawaii, it did not violate §605-14 nor §605-17; thus plaintiff could recover fees under this section for services rendered by firm.  87 H. 37, 951 P.2d 487.</P>

<P>  As this section does not expressly or obviously manifest an intent to be applied retroactively, the 1993 amendment does not apply retroactively to litigation terminated prior to the effective date of the amendment, July 1, 1993.  88 H. 46, 961 P.2d 611.  Proper cap on the maximum amount of attorneys' fees that can be awarded as a result of circuit court action where final judgment was entered in 1992 is that found in the statute in effect in 1992; this statutory cap is the maximum total amount that can be awarded, not an amount that can be awarded to each prevailing party.  88 H. 46, 961 P.2d 611.</P>

<P>  Action in the nature of reformation does not fall within scope of this section.  3 H. App. 101, 641 P.2d 1361.</P>
<P>  Where contract fully performed, action on contract for sum certain is "in the nature of assumpsit".  3 H. App. 624, 656 P.2d 1353.</P>

<P>  Error to award fees based on punitive damages counterclaim.  5 H. App. 174, 683 P.2d 833.</P>
<P>  Action to collect on judgment rendered in proceeding to confirm arbitrator's award not an assumpsit action.  5 H. App. 315, 690 P.2d 1310.</P>
<P>  Under circumstances, attorney's fees should have been awarded in accordance with this section rather than §607-17.  5 H. App. 581, 704 P.2d 930.</P>
<P>  Computation of fees on complaint and counterclaim; exclusion where fees based on duplicative claim.  5 H. App. 603, 705 P.2d 67.</P>
<P>  Award of attorneys' fees for defendant erroneous where plaintiff's claims against defendant stemmed primarily from allegations of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and statutory violations, not breach of contract.  92 H. 243, 990 P.2d 713.</P>
<P>  Where defendant prevailed on its claim to the contract deposit and successfully defended against plaintiff's specific performance/breach claim, defendant, "on balance", was the prevailing party on the issues in the case and was thus entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees under this section. 92 H. 482, 993 P.2d 516.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff not entitled to attorneys' fees pursuant to this section for plaintiff's appeal as an appeal is not a distinct "action" but a continuation of the original action and plaintiff's underlying action in the trial court sounded in tort and not assumpsit.  93 H. 1, 994 P.2d 1047.</P>
<P>  A defendant who succeeds in obtaining a judgment of dismissal is a prevailing party for the purposes of fees under this section.  96 H. 327, 31 P.3d 184.</P>
<P>  In appropriate cases, a request or award of attorneys' fees may include compensation for separately billed legal services performed by a paralegal, legal assistant, or law clerk; the reasonableness of legal assistant fees must be reviewed on a case by case basis for the value of services rendered and an award of such fees must be limited to charges for work performed that would otherwise have been required to be performed by a licensed attorney at a higher rate.  96 H. 327, 31 P.3d 184.</P>
<P>  As proceedings under §431:15-323 are not in the nature of assumpsit, trial court did not err in denying insurance commissioner attorneys' fees under this section in suit against customer of liquidated mutual benefit society.  99 H. 53, 52 P.3d 823.</P>
<P>  In making attorney's fee awards under §666-14 and this section, the trial court must designate the specific amount awarded pursuant to each statute to prevent duplicative awards and permit effective appellate review of awards.  85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609.</P>

<P>  Pursuant to this section, attorney's fees may be awarded under a sublease as a sublease is contractual in nature and this section authorizes such an award in all actions on "contract[s] in writing that provides for an attorney's fee".  85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609.</P>
<P>  The amount of the judgment upon which attorneys' fees are calculated under this section should include prejudgment interest.  85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609.</P>
<P>  Under §666-14, a landlord may, incident to a summary possession action, seek attorney's fees attributable to the summary possession action which are in addition to, but not duplicative of, any fees awarded under this section.  85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609.</P>
