<P>&#9;For the plan year beginning July 1, 2005, the adjusted base monthly contribution shall be computed using the actual contracted premium rate as of July 1, 2004, for medicare and non-medicare, self and family health benefit plans with the highest actual contracted premium rate as of July 1, 2004.</P>
<P>&#9;As used in this subsection, "medicare part B premium rate" means the rate published in the Federal Register each year on November 1 or on the business day closest to November 1 of each year after the medicare part B premium rate has been established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and approved by the United States Congress.
