Upon legislative acceptance of the findings within sixty days of the first regular legislative session convened following the submittal of such findings, no additional moneys may be expended pursuant to such development agreements from the transit fund.  Except that such limitation on the expenditure of moneys from the transit fund shall not occur prior to December&nbsp;31, 1992.  Any unencumbered moneys remaining in the transit fund at that time shall lapse to the general fund.  The remaining terms and conditions of the development agreement shall remain in effect.
