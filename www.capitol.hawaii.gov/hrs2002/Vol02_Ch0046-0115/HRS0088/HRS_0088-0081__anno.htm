<P>  Average final compensation does not include pay for temporary summer work where no retirement contributions deducted.  Att. Gen. Op. 85-10.</P>
<P>  In general, the calculation of retirement benefits of elective officers who were elective officers on July 1, 1997, pursuant to Act 374, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997, should be made thus:  the law as it existed before the effective date of Act 374 (July 1, 1997) is applied to service accrued before the effective date of the Act (i.e., elective officers can apply a high average final compensation to years of possibly multiple types of services, including elective service) and the amount derived from that calculation is added to the amount arrived at by applying the Act to service accrued after the effective date of the Act (which is segregated by service category).  This results in using different average final compensations for pre- and post-Act service.  Att. Gen. Op. 2000-1.</P>
