<P>  A water management area designation is not the product of a contested case hearing, under this chapter, from which a direct appeal to the supreme court may be brought under §174C-60.  83 H. 484, 927 P.2d 1367.</P>
<P>  Where director's violation of §91-13 by consulting materials and individuals outside the record did not prejudice appellant's substantial rights, harmless error.  87 H. 217, 953 P.2d 1315.</P>

<P>  Where no express procedure provided in Maui charter or Maui special management area rules for appeal of Maui planning director's decision on a minor permit application to the Maui planning commission, and commission delegated authority to render final decision on minor permit applications to director pursuant to §205A-22, director's decision not to process developer's application was a final decision equivalent to a denial of the application and was thus appealable under subsection (a).  88 H. 108, 962 P.2d 367.</P>
<P>  A decision that finally adjudicates the matter of medical and temporary disability benefits under §§386-21, 386-31(b), and 386-32(b) is an appealable final order under subsection (a), even though the matter of permanent disability benefits under §§386-31(a) and 386-32(a) has been left for later determination.  89 H. 436, 974 P.2d 1026.</P>
<P>  Where entitlement to permanent disability or disfigurement benefits is the right of the claimant that remains undetermined and is the matter for which jurisdiction is retained by the labor director, a decision of the labor and industrial relations appeals board that otherwise finally adjudicates the matters of medical and temporary disability benefits is an appealable final order under subsection (a).  89 H. 436, 974 P.2d 1026.</P>
<P>  Where county board of appeals at no time questioned or disclaimed planning director's action, and director could not have issued denial of appeal on director's own authority, director acted on behalf of board when director summarily rejected plaintiffs' appeals as untimely; thus, director's denial constituted a "final decision" by the board under subsection (a), which circuit court had jurisdiction to review on appeal.  90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiffs' members, as native Hawaiians who exercised such rights as were customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence, cultural, and religious purposes, sufficiently demonstrated injury to their interests for purposes of appeal under this chapter, the trial court properly concluded that plaintiff had standing to invoke judicial resolution of the land use commission's decision.  94 H. 31, 7 P.3d 1068.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated an "injury in fact" by alleging facts to show that its members were recreational users of the petition area and that land use commission's action would "diminish" such use, and also asserted their interests in protecting West Hawaii's scenic, aesthetic, historic, and biological resources, they were "persons aggrieved" within the meaning of this section and trial court did not err in concluding plaintiff had standing to seek judicial review of the commission's decision.  94 H. 31, 7 P.3d 1068.</P>

<P>  Public employers directly affected by agency's order were "aggrieved persons" and their filing of amicus briefs with agency was sufficient "adversary participation"; standard used by appellate court when reviewing circuit court's review of agency decision.  5 H. App. 533, 704 P.2d 917.</P>
<P>  Does not require that all evidence before agency support its findings; sufficient if findings supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.  6 H. App. 540, 735 P.2d 950.</P>
<P>  No "contested case" occurred even though there are situations where a public hearing may be considered a contested case because department rules established procedures for contested cases.  8 H. App. 16, 791 P.2d 1267.</P>
<P>  Service of certified copy of agency decision under this section is complete when certified copy is deposited in the mail.  9 H. App. 298, 837 P.2d 311.</P>
<P>  Standard used in review of administrative agency decision. 9 H. App. 377, 842 P.2d 648.</P>
<P>  County of Hawai`i department of finance was an "agency" within the meaning of chapter 91, and was not a "person" entitled to appeal under this section (prior to 1993 amendment).  77 H. 396 (App.), 885 P.2d 1137.</P>
<P>  Although not titled "Notice of Appeal", where document fairly communicated appellants' intent to appeal appeals administrator's decision and record contained no indication that the document misled or prejudiced department in any way, circuit court had jurisdiction over appellants' appeal.  98 H. 80 (App.), 42 P.3d 657.</P>
<P>  Appellants were not entitled to be compensated for their costs in defending against department's efforts to recoup benefits allegedly overpaid to them as pursuant to subsection (g), there is no authority vested in the hearing officer, the circuit court, or the appellate court to award damages to appellants for these costs.  98 H. 80 (App.), 42 P.3d 657.</P>
<P>  Because appellant did not demonstrate that it suffered concrete injury, it was not a person "aggrieved" by HLRB decision; thus, it did not have standing to appeal decision to circuit court.  80 H. 376 (App.), 910 P.2d 147.</P>
