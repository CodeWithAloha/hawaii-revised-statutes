<P>&#9;<B>§92-1  Declaration of policy and intent.</B>  In a democracy, the people are vested with the ultimate decision-making power.  Governmental agencies exist to aid the people in the formation and conduct of public policy.  Opening up the governmental processes to public scrutiny and participation is the only viable and reasonable method of protecting the public's interest.  Therefore, the legislature declares that it is the policy of this State that the formation and conduct of public policy -the discussions, deliberations, decisions, and action of governmental agencies -shall be conducted as openly as possible.  To implement this policy the legislature declares that:</P><DIR>
