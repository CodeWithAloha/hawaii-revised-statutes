<DIR>

<P>&#9;(a)&#9;A "sale on approval" if the goods are delivered primarily for use; and</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;A "sale or return" if the goods are delivered primarily for resale.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)  Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance; goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  Any "or return" term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this Article (section 490:2-201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 490:2-202).
