<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§490:7-307  Lien of carrier.</B>  (1)  A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading for charges subsequent to the date of its receipt of the goods for storage or transportation (including demurrage and terminal charges) and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  But against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs, or if no charges are stated then to a reasonable charge.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)  A lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) on goods which the carrier was required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subject the goods to such charges and expenses.  Any other lien under subsection (1) is effective against the consignor and any person who permitted the bailor to have control or possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked such authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  A carrier loses his lien on any goods which he voluntarily delivers or which he unjustifiably refuses to deliver. [L 1965, c 208, §7-307; HRS §490:7-307]</P>
