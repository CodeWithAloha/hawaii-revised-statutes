<B><P> </B> <B>Prior</B> <B>Uniform</B> <B>Statutory</B> <B>Provision,</B> <B>Changes</B> <B>and</B> <B>New</B> <B>Matter:</P>
</B><P>  1.  "Action".  See similar definitions in Section 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law; Section 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.  The definition has been rephrased and enlarged.</P>
<P>  2.  "Aggrieved party".  New.</P>
<P>  3.  "Agreement".  New.  As used in this Act the word is intended to include full recognition of usage of trade, course of dealing, course of performance and the surrounding circumstances as effective parts thereof, and of any agreement permitted under the provisions of this Act to displace a stated rule of law.</P>
<P>  4.  "Bank".  See Section 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law.</P>
<P>  5.  "Bearer".  From Section 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law.  The prior definition has been broadened.</P>
<P>  6.  "Bill of Lading".  See similar definitions in Section 1, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.  The definition has been enlarged to include freight forwarders' bills and bills issued by contract carriers as well as those issued by common carriers.  The definition of airbill is new.</P>
<P>  7.  "Branch".  New.</P>
<P>  8.  "Burden of establishing a fact".  New.</P>
<P>  9.  "Buyer in ordinary course of business".  From Section 1, Uniform Trusts Receipts Act.  The definition has been expanded to make clear the type of person protected.  Its major significance lies in Section 2-403 and in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).</P>
<P>  10.  "Conspicuous".  New.  This is intended to indicate some of the methods of making a term attention-calling.  But the test is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it.</P>
<P>  11.  "Contract".  New.  But see Sections 3 and 71, Uniform Sales Act.</P>
<P>  12.  "Creditor".  New.</P>
<P>  13.  "Defendant".  From Section 76, Uniform Sales Act. Rephrased.</P>
<P>  14.  "Delivery".  Section 76, Uniform Sales Act, Section 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act and Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</P>
<P>  15.  "Document of title".  From Section 76, Uniform Sales Act, but rephrased to eliminate certain ambiguities.  Thus, by making it explicit that the obligation or designation of a third party as "bailee" is essential to a document of title, this definition clearly rejects any such result as obtained in Hixson v. Ward, 254 Ill. App. 505 (1929), which treated a conditional sales contract as a document of title.  Also the definition is left open so that new types of documents may be included.  It is unforeseeable what documents may one day serve the essential purpose now filled by warehouse receipts and bills of lading.  Truck transport has already opened up problems which do not fit the patterns of practice resting upon the assumption that a draft can move through banking channels faster than the goods themselves can reach their destination.  There lie ahead air transport and such probabilities as teletype transmission of what may some day be regarded commercially as "Documents of Title".  The definition is stated in terms of the function of the documents with the intention that any document which gains commercial recognition as accomplishing the desired result shall be included within its scope.  Fungible goods are adequately identified within the language of the definition by identification of the mass of which they are a part.</P>
<P>  Dock warrants were within the Sales Act definition of document of title apparently for the purpose of recognizing a valid tender by means of such paper.  In current commercial practice a dock warrant or receipt is a kind of interim certificate issued by steamship companies upon delivery of the goods at the dock, entitling a designated person to have issued to him at the company's office a bill of lading.  The receipt itself is invariably nonnegotiable in form although it may indicate that a negotiable bill is to be forthcoming.  Such a document is not within the general compass of the definition, although trade usage may in some cases entitle such paper to be treated as a document of title.  If the dock receipt actually represents a storage obligation undertaken by the shipping company, then it is a warehouse receipt within this Section regardless of the name given to the instrument.</P>
<P>  The goods must be "described", but the description may be by marks or labels and may be qualified in such a way as to disclaim personal knowledge of the issuer regarding contents or condition.  However, baggage and parcel checks and similar "tokens" of storage which identify stored goods only as those received in exchange for the token are not covered by this Article.</P>
<P>  The definition is broad enough to include an airway bill.</P>
<P>  16.  "Fault".  From Section 76, Uniform Sales Act.</P>
<P>  17.  "Fungible".  See Sections 5, 6 and 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.  Fungibility of goods "by agreement" has been added for clarity and accuracy.  As to securities, see Section 8-107 and Comment.</P>
<P>  18.  "Genuine".  New.</P>
<P>  19.  "Good faith".  See Section 76(2), Uniform Sales Act; Section 58(2), Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 53(2), Uniform Bills of Lading Act; Section 22(2), Uniform Stock Transfer Act.  "Good faith", whenever it is used in the Code, means at least what is here stated.  In certain Articles, by specific provision, additional requirements are made applicable.  See, e.g., Secs. 2-103(1) (b), 7-404.  To illustrate, in the Article on Sales, Section 2-103, good faith is expressly defined as including in the case of a merchant observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade, so that throughout that Article wherever a merchant appears in the case an inquiry into his observance of such standards is necessary to determine his good faith.</P>
<P>  20.  "Holder".  See similar definitions in Section 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law; Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</P>
<P>  21.  "Honor".  New.</P>
<P>  22.  "Insolvency proceedings".  New.</P>
<P>  23.  "Insolvent".  Section 76(3), Uniform Sales Act.  The three tests of insolvency - "ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business," "cannot pay his debts as they become due," and "insolvent within the meaning of the federal bankruptcy law" - are expressly set up as alternative tests and must be approached from a commercial standpoint.</P>
<P>  24.  "Money".  Section 6(5), Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law.  The test adopted is that of sanction of government, whether by authorization before issue or adoption afterward, which recognizes the circulating medium as a part of the official currency of that government.  The narrow view that money is limited to legal tender is rejected.</P>
<P>  25.  "Notice".  New.  Compare N.I.L. Sec. 56.  Under the definition a person has notice when he has received a notification of the fact in question.  But by the last sentence the act leaves open the time and circumstances under which notice or notification may cease to be effective.  Therefore such cases as Graham v. White-Phillips Co., 296 U.S. 27, 56 S.Ct. 21, 80 L.Ed. 20 (1935), are not overruled.</P>
<P>  26.  "Notifies".  New.  This is the word used when the essential fact is the proper dispatch of the notice not its receipt.  Compare "Send".  When the essential fact is the other party's receipt of the notice, that is stated.  The second sentence states when a notification is received.</P>
<P>  27.  New.  This makes clear that reason to know, knowledge, or a notification, although "received" for instance by a clerk in Department A of an organization, is effective for a transaction conducted in Department B only from the time when it was or should have been communicated to the individual conducting that transaction.</P>
<P>  28.  "Organization".  This is the definition of every type of entity or association, excluding an individual, acting as such.  Definitions of "person" were included in Section 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law; Section 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act; Section 22, Uniform Stock Transfer Act; Section 1, Uniform Trust Receipts Act.  The definition of "organization" given here includes a number of entities or associations not specifically mentioned in prior definition of "person", namely, government, governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, trust and estate.</P>
<P>  29.  "Party".  New.  Mention of a party includes, of course, a person acting through an agent.  However, where an agent comes into opposition or contrast to his principal, particular account is taken of that situation.</P>
<P>  30.  "Person".  See Comment to definition of "Organization".  The reference to Section 1-102 is to subsection (5) of that section.</P>
<P>  31.  "Presumption".  New.</P>
<P>  32.  "Purchase".  Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act; Section 22, Uniform Stock Transfer Act; Section 1, Uniform Trust Receipts Act.  Rephrased.</P>
<P>  33.  "Purchaser".  Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act; Section 22, Uniform Stock Transfer Act; Section 1, Uniform Trust Receipts Act.  Rephrased.</P>
<P>  34.  "Remedy".  New.  The purpose is to make it clear that both remedy and rights (as defined) include those remedial rights of "self help" which are among the most important bodies of rights under this Act, remedial rights being those to which an aggrieved party can resort on his own motion.</P>
<P>  35.  "Representative".  New.</P>
<P>  36.  "Rights".  New.  See Comment to "Remedy".</P>
<P>  37.  "Security Interest".  See Section 1, Uniform Trust Receipts Act.  The present definition is elaborated, in view especially of the complete coverage of the subject in Article 9.  Notice that in view of the Article the term includes the interest of certain outright buyers of certain kinds of property.  The last two sentences give guidance on the question whether reservation of title under a particular lease of personal property is or is not a security interest.</P>
<P>  38.  "Send".  New.  Compare "notifies".</P>
<P>  39.  "Signed".  New.  The inclusion of authentication in the definition of "signed" is to make clear that as the term is used in this Act a complete signature is not necessary.  Authentication may be printed, stamped or written; it may be by initials or by thumbprint.  It may be on any part of the document and in appropriate cases may be found in a billhead or letterhead.  No catalog of possible authentications can be complete and the court must use common sense and commercial experience in passing upon these matters.  The question always is whether the symbol was executed or adopted by the party with present intention to authenticate the writing.</P>
<P>  40.  "Surety".  New.</P>
<P>  41.  "Telegram".  New.</P>
<P>  42.  "Term".  New.</P>
<P>  43.  "Unauthorized".  New.</P>
<P>  44.  "Value".  See Sections 25, 26, 27, 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law; Section 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act; Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 22(1), Uniform Stock Transfer Act; Section 1, Uniform Trust Receipts Act.  All the Uniform Acts in the commercial law field (except the Uniform Conditional Sales Act) have carried definitions of "value".  All those definitions provided that value was any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract, including the taking of property in satisfaction of or as security for a preexisting claim.  Subsections (a), (b) and (d) in substance continue the definitions of "value" in the earlier acts.  Subsection (c) makes explicit that "value" is also given in a third situation: where a buyer by taking delivery under a preexisting contract converts a contingent into a fixed obligation.</P>
<P>  This definition is not applicable to Articles 3 and 4, but the express inclusion of immediately available credit as value follows the separate definitions in those Articles.  See Sections 4-208, 4-209, 3-303.  A bank or other financing agency which in good faith makes advances against property held as collateral becomes a bona fide purchaser of that property even though provision may be made for charge-back in case of trouble.  Checking credit is "immediately available" within the meaning of this section if the bank would be subject to an action for slander of credit in case checks drawn against the credit were dishonored, and when a charge-back is not discretionary with the bank, but may only be made when difficulties in collection arise in connection with the specific transaction involved.</P>
<P>  45.  "Warehouse receipt".  See Section 76(1), Uniform Sales Act; Section 1, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.  Receipts issued by a field warehouse are included, provided the warehouseman and the depositor of the goods are different persons.</P>
<P>  46.  "Written" or "writing".  This is a broadening of the definition contained in Section 191 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law.</P>
