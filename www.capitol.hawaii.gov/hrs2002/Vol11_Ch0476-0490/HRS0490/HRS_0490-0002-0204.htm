<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§490:2-204  Formation in general.</B>  (1)  A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)  An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sales does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy. [L 1965, c 208, §2-204; HRS §490:2-204]</P>
