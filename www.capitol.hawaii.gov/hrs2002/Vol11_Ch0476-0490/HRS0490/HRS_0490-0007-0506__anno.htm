<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 35, Uniform Sales Act; Section 43, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 34, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Consolidated and rewritten; former requirement that transfer be "for value" eliminated.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  From a commercial point of view the intention to transfer a negotiable document of title which requires an indorsement for its transfer, is incompatible with an intention to withhold such indorsement and so defeat the effective use of the document.  This position is sustained by the absence of any reported case applying the prior provisions in almost forty years of decisions.  Further, the preceding section and the Comment thereto make it clear that an indorsement generally imposes no responsibility on the indorser.</P>
<P>  2.  Although this section provides that delivery of a document of title without the necessary indorsement is effective as a transfer, the transferee, of course, has not regularized his position until such indorsement is supplied.  Until this is done he cannot claim rights under due negotiation within the requirements of this Article (subsection (4) of Section 7-501) on "due negotiation."  Similarly, despite the transfer to him of his transferor's title, he cannot demand the goods from the bailee until the negotiation has been completed and the document is in proper form for surrender.  See Section 7-403(2).</P>
