<P>&#9;(b)  An agreement sufficient to constitute a lease contract may be found although the moment of its making is undetermined.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Although one or more terms are left open, a lease contract does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a lease contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy. [L 1991, c 40, pt of §1]</P>
