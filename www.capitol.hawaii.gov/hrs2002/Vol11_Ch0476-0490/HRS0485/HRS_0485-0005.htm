The commissioner shall grant approval for the exemption upon finding that the proposed plan of business of the applicant and the proposed issuance of securities are fair, just, and equitable, that the applicant intends to transact its business fairly and honestly, and that the securities that the applicant proposes to issue and the method to be used by the applicant in issuing or disposing of such securities are not such as, in the opinion of the commissioner, will work a fraud upon the purchaser thereof.
