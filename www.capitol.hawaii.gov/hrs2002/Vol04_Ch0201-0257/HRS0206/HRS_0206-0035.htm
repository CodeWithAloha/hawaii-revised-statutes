The contract may provide further that in case of such conveyance, the federal government may complete, operate, manage, lease, convey, or otherwise deal with the project in accordance with the terms of the contract; provided that the contract shall require that, as soon as practicable after the federal government is satisfied that all defaults with respect to the project have been cured and that the project will thereafter be operated in accordance with the terms of the contract, the federal government shall reconvey to the board the project as then constituted.
