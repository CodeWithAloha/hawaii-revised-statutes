<B><P>&#9;[§255D-7]  Cooperating sovereigns.</B>  The agreement authorized by this chapter is an accord among individual cooperating sovereigns in furtherance of their governmental functions.

No person, other than a member state, is an intended beneficiary of the agreement.  Any benefit to a person other than a state is established by the law of this State and the other member states and not by the terms of the agreement.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Consistent with subsection (a), no person shall have  any cause of action or defense under the agreement or by virtue of this State's approval of the agreement.

<P>&#9;(b)  A seller that contracts with a certified service provider is not liable to the State for sales or use taxes due on transactions processed by the certified service provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or committed fraud.  In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller is not subject to audit on the transactions processed by the certified service provider.  A seller is subject to audit for transactions not processed by the certified service provider.  The member states acting jointly may perform a system check of the seller and review the seller's procedures to determine if the certified service provider's system is functioning properly and the extent to which the seller's transactions are being processed by the certified service provider.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A person that provides a certified automated system is responsible for the proper functioning of that system and is liable to the State for underpayments of tax attributable to errors in the functioning of the certified automated system.
