<P>&#9;(b)  The authority may pledge revenues derived from the public facility financed from the proceeds of the revenue bonds to the punctual payment of the principal, interest, and redemption premiums, if any, on the revenue bonds.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The revenue bonds may be additionally secured by the pledge or assignment of the loans and other agreements or any note or other undertaking, obligation, or property held by the authority to secure the loans.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Any pledge made by the authority shall create a perfected security interest in the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority from and after the time that a financing statement with respect to the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged and thereafter received shall be filed with the bureau of conveyances.  Upon such filing, the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of any such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be prior to the lien of all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.  This section shall apply to any financing statement heretofore or hereafter filed with the bureau of conveyances with respect to any pledge made to secure revenue bonds issued under this part.
