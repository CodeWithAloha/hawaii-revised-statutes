<P>&#9;The amount of the credit shall be four per cent of the construction or renovation costs incurred during the taxable year for each qualified hotel facility located in Hawaii, and shall not include the construction or renovation costs for which another credit was claimed under this chapter for the taxable year.</P>
<P>&#9;In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, trust, association of apartment owners of a qualified hotel facility, time share owners association, or any developer of a time share project, the tax credit allowable is for construction or renovation costs incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The cost upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level.  Distribution and share of credit shall be determined pursuant to section 235-110.7(a).</P>

All claims for a tax credit under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</P>

The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.</P>
