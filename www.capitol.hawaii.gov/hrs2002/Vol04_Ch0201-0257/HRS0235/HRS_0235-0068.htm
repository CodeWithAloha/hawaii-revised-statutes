<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The transferor is a resident person; or</P>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>This subsection shall not apply if the transferee has actual knowledge that the affidavit referred to in this subsection is false.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  An application for a withholding certificate may be submitted by the transferor to the department setting forth:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The name, address, and taxpayer identification number, if any, of the parties to the transaction and the location and general description of the real property to be transferred; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A calculation and written justification showing that the transferor will not realize any gain with respect to the transfer; or</P>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;Upon receipt of the application, the department shall determine whether the transferor has realized or will realize any gain with respect to the transfer, or whether there will be insufficient proceeds to pay the withholding.  If the department is satisfied that no gain will be realized or that there will be insufficient proceeds to pay the withholding, it shall issue a withholding certificate stating the amount to be withheld, if any.</P>

<P>&#9;(f)  No person shall be required to deduct and withhold any amount under subsection (b) if one or more individual transferors furnishes to the transferee an affidavit by the transferor stating the transferor's taxpayer identification number, that for the year preceding the date of the transfer the property has been used by the transferor as a principal residence, and that the amount realized for the property does not exceed $300,000.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  The department may enter into written agreements with persons who engage in more than one real property transaction in a calendar year or other persons to whom meeting the withholding requirements of this section are not practicable.  The written agreements may allow the use of a withholding method other than that prescribed by this section or may waive the withholding requirement under this section.
