<P>  Crime of promoting dangerous drug by distributing same is complete upon offer to sell the contraband; actual delivery or chemical analysis not required.  63 H. 77, 621 P.2d 364.</P>
<P>  Nothing in subsection (1)(b)(ii)(A) required that defendant "possess[] at any one time" one-eighth ounce or more of a cocaine-containing substance or that the substance be delivered all at once in a "single container"; undercover police officer’s testimony constituted substantial evidence supporting jury’s verdict finding defendant guilty.  77 H. 72, 881 P.2d 1218.</P>

<P>  Defendants did not prove entrapment under §702-237(1)(b) by preponderance of evidence as required by §701-115(2)(b); officer's conduct merely provided defendants with opportunity to commit offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree.  82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d 916.</P>
