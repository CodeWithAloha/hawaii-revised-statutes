<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)&#9;Class B felonies; and</P>
<P>&#9;(c)&#9;Class C felonies.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;A felony is a class A, class B, or class C felony when it is so designated by this Code.  Except for first and second degree murder and attempted first and second degree murder, a crime declared to be a felony, without specification of class, is a class C felony.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)  A felony defined by any statute of this State other than this Code shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a class C felony, except if another provision of law specifically defines a felony to be of a specified class as defined by this Code, such felony shall be treated for the purpose of sentence as provided by this chapter for that class of felony.
