</B>
<P>  This section is definitional only and, of course, specifies no offense.  A discussion of the definitions in this section, when needed or appropriate, is found in the commentary to the substantive offenses employing the terms defined.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §711-1100</P>
</B>
<P>  The Code as adopted added Items (5) and (6).  The Proposed Draft did not contain these items.</P>
<P>  Act 192, Session Laws 1986, amended the definition of "animal" to exclude human beings, thereby foreclosing the possible interpretation of the statute to include within the offense persons engaged in boxing.  House Conference Committee Report No. 37-86, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 27-86, and House Standing Committee Report No. 392.</P>
<P>  Act 292, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding the definition of "facsimile" to strengthen the laws against harassment.  Conference Committee Report No. 57.</P>
<P>  Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended this section by adding the definitions of "pet animal" and "necessary sustenance".  Act 173 protected pet animals in Hawaii from neglect by defining minimum standards of care.  The legislature found that pet animals deserved at least the minimum care of food, water, and protection from the elements.  Act 173 established guidelines to be used to prevent the neglect and abuse of pet animals.  Conference Committee Report No. 87.</P>
<P>  Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by adding the definition of "record".  The legislature found that advancement in technology has provided opportunity for "video voyeurism" in public places.  A change in the offense of violation of privacy would address the growing concern for the offensive practice of "upskirt photography".  House Standing Committee Report No. 1316.</P>
