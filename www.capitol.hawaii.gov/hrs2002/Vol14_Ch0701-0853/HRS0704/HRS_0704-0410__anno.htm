</B>
<P>  This section sets forth the form in which expert testimony shall proceed at a hearing on the issue of fitness to proceed, at a hearing or trial on the issue of defendant's responsibility, or at a trial on the issue of defendant's capacity to have a particular state of mind.</P>
<P>  Subsection (1) allows the court somewhat greater freedom than that which existed under the prior law by permitting it to call an examiner, who has reported pursuant to §704-404, as a witness.  If the court does call an examiner, cross-examination is permitted by both parties.  Subsection (1) also precludes opinion testimony as to the defendant's condition by an expert who has not examined the defendant.  The intent of the Code is to eliminate testimony in this area based solely on a hypothetical question or an observation in a courtroom or both.</P>
<P>  Subsections (2), (3) and (4) assure that an expert who has examined the defendant will have an adequate opportunity to state and explain the expert's diagnosis of the defendant's relevant physical or mental condition and to state and explain the expert's opinion as to the impairment of the defendant's relevant capacities without being restricted to examination by means of the hypothetical question.  The expert is, of course, subject to cross-examination on any statement which the expert makes by way of diagnosis, opinion, or explanation and on any other matter bearing on the expert's competency or credibility.</P>

<P>  Act 305, Session Laws 1988, included licensed psychologists among the professionals which may provide offender examination services to the Hawaii criminal justice system.  The legislature stated that the present laws, which permit only psychiatric evaluation, are inconsistent with the many and varied uses the court has found for the services of licensed psychologists.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2153.</P>
