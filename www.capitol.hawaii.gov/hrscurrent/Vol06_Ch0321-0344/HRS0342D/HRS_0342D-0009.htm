342D-31 by sending written notice, either by certified mail or by personal
service, to the alleged violator or violators describing the violation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If the director determines that any person
is continuing to violate this chapter, any rule adopted pursuant to this
chapter, or any permit or variance issued pursuant to this chapter after having
been served notice of violation, the director:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Shall cause written notice to be served upon the
alleged violator or violators.  The notice shall specify the alleged violation
and shall contain an order requiring that person to submit a written schedule
within thirty days specifying the measures to be taken and the time within

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Shall issue to the alleged violator or violators
a cease and desist order against the activities that violate this chapter, any
rule adopted pursuant to this chapter, or any permit or variance issued

nonadherence or violation with reasonable particularity.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Any order issued under this chapter shall
become final, unless not later than twenty days after the notice of order is
served, the person or persons named therein request in writing a hearing before
the director.  Any penalty imposed under this chapter shall become due and
payable twenty days after the notice of penalty is served unless the person or
persons named therein request in writing a hearing before the director. 
Whenever a hearing is requested on any penalty imposed under this chapter, the
penalty shall become due and payable only upon completion of all review
proceedings and the issuance of a final order confirming the penalty in whole
or in part.  Upon request for a hearing, the director shall require that the
alleged violator or violators appear before the director for a hearing at a
time and place specified in the notice and answer the charges complained of.</p>

action as may be appropriate.  If, after a hearing on an order or penalty
contained in a notice, the director finds that no violation has occurred or is
occurring, the director shall rescind the order or penalty.  Any order issued
after hearing may prescribe the date or dates by which the violation or
violations shall cease and may prescribe timetables for necessary action in
preventing, abating, or controlling the violation or discharges.</p>

penalty imposed, the director need only show that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A hearing was held or the time granted for
requesting a hearing expired without a request for a hearing;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The administrative penalty was imposed; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The penalty remains unpaid.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  In connection with any hearing held
pursuant to this section, the director shall have the power to subpoena the
attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence on behalf of all
parties. [L 1989, c 212, pt of §2; am L 1990, c 298, §3; am L 1995, c 180, §9;
