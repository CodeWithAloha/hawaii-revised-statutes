marijuana products between production centers and retail dispensing locations,
including tracking identification issued by the tracking system, the identity
of the person transporting the marijuana or manufactured marijuana products,

three proposals for the computer software tracking system; and the selection of
the computer software tracking system shall be approved by the director of the
department and the chief information officer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  A dispensary licensed pursuant to this
chapter shall purchase, operate, and maintain a computer software tracking
system that shall:</p>

and data capture, all marijuana, marijuana plants, and manufactured marijuana

if no certified laboratory is located in the county or on the island where the
dispensary is located; provided further that a dispensary shall only transport
samples of marijuana and manufactured marijuana products for laboratory testing
for purposes of this subsection in an amount and manner prescribed by the
department, in rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, and with the
understanding that state law and its protections do not apply outside of the
