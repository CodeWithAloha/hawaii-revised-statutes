<p class=XNotes>  Section 486H-10 prohibiting manufacturers and jobbers of
petroleum products from operating a retail service station for retail sale of
petroleum products did not violate eminent domain clause of Hawaii
constitution.  Att. Gen. Op. 95-4. </p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Law Journals and Reviews</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Even assuming provision is sufficiently clear to waive
State's immunity under Eleventh Amendment, provision would confer jurisdiction
only upon state courts.  693 F.2d 928.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Inverse condemnation action discussed.  840 F.2d 678.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where landowners argued that ordinance creating mechanism
through which condominium owners could convert their leasehold interests into
fee simple interests violated public use clause of U.S. and Hawaii
Constitutions, ordinance was constitutional; landowners' claim under just
compensation clause not ripe for federal adjudication.  124 F.3d 1150.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Courts are immune from prohibition against taking without
compensation.  402 F. Supp. 95.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where provision was made for just compensation, city
ordinance providing mechanism for transfer of fee interest from condominium
lessors to lessees was constitutional.  802 F. Supp. 326.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Condominium lease-to-fee ordinance did not effect an
impermissible taking.  832 F. Supp. 1404.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Attorney's fees and expenses are not embraced within &quot;just
compensation&quot;.  53 H. 582, 499 P.2d 663.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Damaged&quot; provision discussed.  55 H. 226, 517 P.2d
7.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Taking under Land Reform Act is for a public use; act's
valuation scheme does not deprive landowners of just compensation.  68 H. 55,
704 P.2d 888.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Just compensation in leasehold condemnation under chapter
516.  72 H. 383, 819 P.2d 82.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Condemnation of leased fee interests in residential houselots
continued to satisfy &quot;public use&quot; prerequisite of Fifth Amendment to
U.S. Constitution and this section.  79 H. 64, 898 P.2d 576.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As Hawaiian custom and usage have always been part of the
laws of the State, court's recognition of customary and traditional Hawaiian
rights did not constitute judicial taking.  79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As water is a state public trust resource to which no
individual, including Waiahole Ditch water use permittees, could claim an
exclusive right, permittees being required to fund subsequent stream studies
and monitoring activities was not an unconstitutional &quot;regulatory leveraging&quot;. 
94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No unconstitutional taking of petitioner's property without
just compensation by water resource management commission's denying
petitioner's request to use the ground water underlying its lands and
allocating it instead to other leeward parties where the right to absolute
ownership of water exclusive of the public trust never accompanied the
&quot;bundle of rights&quot; conferred in the Mahele.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the Hawaii constitution, courts may consider the
validity of the public purpose asserted by the government in a condemnation
action and, under appropriate circumstances, consider whether a purported
public purpose is pretextual; thus, under the circumstances of the case, where
it appeared that the trial court erred in declining to expressly examine the
pretext issue in the condemnation, the trial court's judgment in the
condemnation vacated and case remanded.  119 H. 352, 198 P.3d 615.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although a contract that delegates a county's eminent domain
powers raises well-founded concerns that a private purpose is afoot, a per se
rule of pretext would threaten the established rule of deference given to the
government's findings and declarations; by allowing a defendant to present
evidence of pretext beyond the government's findings and declarations, the fact
that a legislative body may not admit that the purpose is for a private benefit
does not alleviate the defendant's burden to show pretext or necessitate a per
se rule of pretext.  124 H. 281, 242 P.3d 1136 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where record reflected that the developer was not the only
entity that stood to benefit from the construction of the bypass road and the
fact that the bypass allowed the developer to develop its property did not
detract or destroy the public character of the bypass or render the
condemnation invalid.  124 H. 281, 242 P.3d 1136 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 73, L 2003, by declaring accreted land to be &quot;public
land&quot; and prohibiting littoral owners from registering existing accretion
under chapter 501 and/or quieting title under chapter 669, permanently divested
a littoral owner of his or her ownership rights to any existing accretions to
oceanfront property that were unregistered or unrecorded as of the effective
date of Act 73 or for which no application for registration or petition to
quiet title was pending; thus, Act 73 effectuated a permanent taking of such
accreted lands without just compensation in violation of this section.  122 H.
34 (App.), 222 P.3d 441 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 73, L 2003, by declaring accreted land to be &quot;public
land&quot; and prohibiting littoral owners from registering future accretion
under chapter 501 and/or quieting title under chapter 669, did not effectuate a
taking of future accreted lands without just compensation in violation of this
section where plaintiffs had no vested right to future accretions to their
oceanfront land that may never materialize.  122 H. 34 (App.), 222 P.3d 441
(2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As a community plan amendment is not an administrative act,
it cannot reasonably be required as a step in reaching a final agency
determination for ripeness purposes; ripeness requires only that landowners
take advantage of any available variances or waivers under existing law, it
does not require them to undertake changing the law itself; thus, appellants
were not required to seek a change in the applicable law, i.e., the community
plan, in order to satisfy the ripeness requirements for their takings claim. 
128 H. 183 (App.), 284 P.3d 956 (2012).</p>
