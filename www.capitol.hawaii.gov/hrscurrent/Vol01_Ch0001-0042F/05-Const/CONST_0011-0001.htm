<p class=XNotes>  This article was redesignated from &quot;Article X
Conservation and Development of Resources&quot; to be &quot;Article XI

election Nov&nbsp;7, 1978.  The former Article XI now appears as Article XII.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>Section 1.</b>  For the benefit of present
and future generations, the State and its political subdivisions shall conserve
and protect Hawaii's natural beauty and all natural resources, including land,
water, air, minerals and energy sources, and shall promote the development and

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A proposal of the 1978 Constitutional Convention deleted the
former section 1 of the old Article X, which read:  &quot;Section 1.  The
legislature shall promote the conservation, development and utilization of
agricultural resources, and fish, mineral, forest, water, land, game and other
natural resources.&quot;  This deletion appears to be one of the unspecified
changes submitted for ratification under Question 34.  On whether any of the
changes submitted under Question 34 was in fact approved by the electorate, see
Kahalekai v. Doi, 60 H. 324, 590 P.2d 543, excerpted in the note preceding the
Preamble to the Constitution.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although the public trust doctrine and the state water code
share similar core principles, the code does not supplant the protections of
the public trust doctrine.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The maintenance of waters in their natural state constitutes
a distinct &quot;use&quot; under the water resources trust.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d
409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The state water resources trust embodies the following
fundamental principles:  the State has both the authority and duty to preserve
the rights of present and future generations in the waters of the State; and
the State bears an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in
the planning and allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust
uses whenever feasible.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section and article XI, §7 of the Hawaii constitution
adopt the public trust doctrine as a fundamental principle of constitutional
law in Hawaii.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under this section, article XI, §7 of the Hawaii constitution
and the sovereign reservation, the public trust doctrine applies to all water
resources, unlimited by any surface-ground distinction.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Pursuant to this section and §7 of the Hawaii constitution,
§220(d) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, and §174C-101(a), a reservation
of water constitutes a public trust purpose.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where commission on water resource management failed to
render the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to
whether applicant had satisfied its burden as mandated by the state water code,
it violated its public trust duty to protect the department of Hawaiian home
lands' reservation rights under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the state
water code, the state constitution, and the public trust doctrine in balancing
the various competing interests in the state water resources trust.  103 H.
401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Department of health's (DOH) duties under the public trust
doctrine requires the DOH to not only issue permits after prescribed measures
appear to be in compliance with state regulation, but also to ensure that the
prescribed measures are actually being implemented after a thorough assessment
of the possible adverse impacts the development would have on the State's natural
resources; this duty is consistent with the constitutional mandate under this
section and the duties imposed upon the DOH by chapters 342D and 342E.  111 H.
205, 140 P.3d 985.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The public trust duties imposed on the State under this
section also applied to the county, as a political subdivision of the State;
this section mandates that the county has an obligation to conserve and protect
the State's natural resources; the county's power under the general laws with
respect to its public trust duty to protect the natural resources of the State
can be found in chapter 180C; thus, the county had a duty to protect the waters
located adjacent to defendant's property.  111 H. 205, 140 P.3d 985.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the department of Hawaiian home lands' reservation of
water did not constitute an &quot;existing legal use&quot; for purposes of
§174C-49(a)(3) but a public trust &quot;purpose&quot;, commission on water
resource management was obligated to take this reservation into account in the
planning and allocation of water resources and to protect it whenever feasible,
as this public trust purpose status made it superior to private interests in
the resources at any given time; however, commission was not precluded from
approving uses which may compromise this reservation, as long as commission's
decision was &quot;made with a level of openness, diligence, and
foresight&quot;.  116 H. 481, 174 P.3d 320.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Commission on water resource management failed in its public
trust duty to hold water use permit applicant to its burden of demonstrating
the absence of other practicable alternative sources of water when it reserved
consideration of feasible alternative sources of water until after the
&quot;new uses&quot; water permit had been granted; commission thus failed to
establish an adequate basis for the amount of &quot;new uses&quot; water
allocated to applicant.  116 H. 481, 174 P.3d 320.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Despite evidence that permit applicant violated chapter 340E,
neither the water code nor the public trust precluded the commission on water
resource management from allocating water to applicant to supply water to
domestic end users from a delivery system that may not comply with chapter
340E; as this jurisdiction separately regulates water allocation and drinking
water standards, and there was no discernable legislative intent to make water
use permit applications subject to compliance with chapter 340E, violations of
chapter 340E were not germane to a review of the propriety of water allocation
under the water code and the public trust.  116 H. 481, 174 P.3d 320.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the public utilities commission dealt not with a
proposed use, but rather a rate increase that did not increase the amount of
water used or change how the water was extracted, and the utility's effect on
the public trust water resources would be the same whether or not the rate increase
was approved by the commission, the commission's rate approval had no effect on
the public trust; thus, the commission did not violate the public trust
doctrine.  127 H. 234 (App.), 277 P.3d 328 (2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellee Kauai County planning commission's public trust duty
under this section, coupled with the State's power to create and delegate
duties to the counties, established that appellee had a duty to conserve and
protect water resources in considering whether to issue a special permit to
appellant water bottling company.  130 H. 407 (App.), 312 P.3d 283 (2013).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Public trust duties under this section extended to appellee
Kauai County planning commission's review of appellant water bottling company's
existing and proposed use of water for its operations; the county's public
trust duty under this section coupled with the State's power to create and
delegate duties and responsibilities to the various counties through the
enactment of statutes, established that the county had a duty to conserve and
protect water in considering whether to issue a use permit and zoning permit to
appellant.  130 H. 407 (App.), 312 P.3d 283 (2013).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The applicable standards and criteria that appellee Kauai
County planning commission was required to employ to meet its public trust
obligations in considering appellant water bottling company's combined
application for a use, zoning, and special permit were:  (1) that appellee's
decision be initially grounded in the framework of statutes and regulatory
provisions that authorize appellee to act; (2) that appellee make appropriate
assessments and require reasonable measures to protect the water resources; and
(3) because appellant sought to use the water for economic gain, that appellee
give the application a higher level of scrutiny and that appellant carry the
burden to justify the use of the water in light of the purposes protected by
the public trust.  130 H. 407 (App.), 312 P.3d 283 (2013).</p>
