information provided by the registered voters signing the nomination papers,
all of the information on the nomination papers is true and correct;</p>

&quot;oath of loyalty&quot; or the &quot;affirmation&quot;, as mandated by
§12-7, the individual's incomplete nomination papers were void on their face,
and the county clerk had no authority to &quot;accept&quot; the nomination
papers; thus, individual did not become an official candidate for the 14th
