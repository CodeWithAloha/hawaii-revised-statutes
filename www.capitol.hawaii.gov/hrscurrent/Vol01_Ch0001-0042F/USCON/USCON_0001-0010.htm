<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Obligation of contracts.</b></p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Bill of attainder.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs, owners of leasehold interests in a condominium
complex, did not meet the burden of establishing that the savings clause of the
ordinance which repealed chapter 38 of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu
constituted a bill of attainder.  378 F. Supp. 2d 1258.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Chapter 134 is not an impermissible bill of attainder with
respect to plaintiff.  548 F. Supp. 2d 1151.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Duty of tonnage.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Mooring and anchoring fees imposed by state regulations not a
duty of tonnage.  42 F.3d 1185.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs argued that mooring and anchoring fees
charged by State were duty of tonnage in violation of this section, plaintiffs'
Article I challenge denied.  823 F. Supp. 766.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Division of boating and ocean recreation's assessment of a
two per cent ocean recreation management area fee against vessel was an
impermissible tax in violation of prohibition against tonnage duties; two per
cent use fee assessed other vessel was not a prohibited duty of tonnage.  195
F. Supp. 2d 1157.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Ex post facto law.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by rule that, for purposes of criminal history
calculation, state conviction for conduct which occurred after defendant's
federal offense, but for which defendant was sentenced before defendant's
sentencing on the federal offense, is counted as a prior sentence.  44 F.3d
749.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Inmates' claim that sex offender treatment program violated
ex post facto clause was ripe; sex offender treatment program did not violate
ex post facto clause.  131 F.3d 818.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Prison's policy of not placing untreated sex offenders in
minimum custody did not violate ex post facto clause.  905 F. Supp. 813.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  General definition of.  50 H. 351, 440 P.2d 528.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1964 amendments to the negligent homicide statute, as applied
to prior wrongdoers, were not ex post facto.  50 H. 351, 440 P.2d 528.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Law providing for increased punishment for repeat offenders,
was not violative of the ex post facto clause.  61 H. 262, 602 P.2d 914.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Retrospective application of §291-4, as amended by Act 128, L
1993, did not violate ex post facto clause.  76 H. 360, 878 P.2d 699.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Chapter 846E not violative of this clause as legislature's
express purpose was for chapter to be remedial rather than punitive and
statutory scheme is not so punitive as to negate the State's remedial purpose. 
105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures
was not offended by the plain language of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending
§§706-661, 706-662, and 706-664 regarding sentencing or resentencing for
extended terms of imprisonment, where it was clear that the new jury provisions
did not (1) increase criminal liability for conduct previously innocent, (2)
aggravate the degree of defendant's crimes, (3) increase the punishment
available at the time defendant committed defendant's crimes, or (4) alter
evidentiary standards to defendant's detriment.  117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the department of public safety's (DPS) written policy
for computing presentence credit for consecutive sentences merely adopted and
enforced the holding of Tauiliili, which set forth the proper interpretation of
§706-671, any change in the DPS's or the Hawaii paroling authority's internal
policies regarding the calculation of presentence credit was irrelevant for
purposes of an ex post facto analysis.  125 H. 429, 263 P.3d 709 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures
was not offended by the retrospective application to defendant of Act 1, L Sp 2007
2d, amending §§706-661, 706-662, and 706-664, where Act 1 did not punish as a
crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, make more
burdensome the punishment for the crime after its commission, nor deprive one
charged with the crime of any defense available according to the law when the
act was committed.  118 H. 68 (App.), 185 P.3d 816.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Import-export.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation in exempting certain locally produced products
from liquor tax.  65 H. 566, 656 P.2d 724.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Obligation of contracts.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  District court did not abuse its discretion in granting
plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, where court granted a
preliminary injunction against operation of Act 355, L 1997  (which amended
§78-13), State's &quot;pay lag&quot; law, on the ground that it impaired the
obligations of the employees' collective bargaining agreement in violation of
the contract clause.  183 F.3d 1096.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where lessees claimed that the ordinance that repealed
chapter 38 of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu impaired their contracts with
the city and county of Honolulu in violation of the contracts clause, the
reserved powers doctrine did not apply and U.S. Trust Co. v. New Jersey's
heightened scrutiny test provided the mandatory analysis.  512 F.3d 1148.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  City ordinance that repealed an existing ordinance that
allowed condominium lessees to convert their leasehold interests into fee
interests through city's power of eminent domain was not in violation of the
contracts clause because it did not impair the city's contractual relationships
with lessees, who at the time, did not have the condemnation of their property
approved by the city council prior to the effective date of the repealing
ordinance.  639 F.3d 907 (2011).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Zoning regulations did not impair development contract but
only affected property which was subject matter of contract.  649 F. Supp. 926.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction granted,
where plaintiffs filed motion seeking to enjoin defendants from delaying
payroll under Act 355, L 1997 (which amended §78-13), with respect to
University of Hawaii faculty members, arguing that Act 355 violated the
contract clause because a five-day delay in pay violated the collective
bargaining agreement between the State and the faculty members at the University. 
16 F. Supp. 2d 1242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was no existing contract that Act 355, L 1997
(amending §78-13), impaired, no contracts clause violation possible and
injunction no longer needed; the case was moot.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Chapter 134 imposes no impairment of a contractual right
possessed by plaintiff.  548 F. Supp. 2d 1151.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Ordinance that repealed chapter 38, Revised Ordinances of
Honolulu, which allowed owners of long-term leasehold interests to convert them
into fee interests through the city and county of Honolulu's eminent domain
power, did not violate the contracts clause.  630 F. Supp. 2d 1233 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Contract clause violated where Act 189 of the 2009 Hawaii
legislature (relating to real property) did not provide for &quot;reasonable
conditions&quot; for meeting the legitimate purpose of Act 189 and was not
&quot;of a character appropriate to the public purpose&quot;.  715 F. Supp. 2d
1115 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The legislature may alter or abolish public positions.  48 H.
370, 405 P.2d 772.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State law requiring lessor to purchase leasehold improvements
upon termination of lease unconstitutionally impairs obligation of preexisting
lease contract.  69 H. 112, 736 P.2d 55.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Clause does not prohibit execution of state laws on Hawaiian
home lands merely because Congress has not expressed its consent to the
exercise of such enforcement power.  80 H. 168, 907 P.2d 754.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No violation by repeal of court reporter temporary
certification rule where repeal did not substantially impair plaintiff's
contractual relationships, repeal served a significant and legitimate public
purpose, and was reasonably and narrowly drawn.  82 H. 329, 922 P.2d 942.</p>
