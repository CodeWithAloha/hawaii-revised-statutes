<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §209.  Successors to lessees.</b>  (a)<span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>  Upon the death of the lessee, the lessee's
interest in the tract or tracts and the improvements thereon, including growing
crops and aquacultural stock (either on the tract or in any collective contract
or program to which the lessee is a party by virtue of the lessee's interest in
the tract or tracts), shall vest in the relatives of the decedent as provided
in this paragraph.  From the following relatives of the lessee who are (1) at
least one-quarter Hawaiian, husband, wife, children, grandchildren, brothers,
or sisters, or (2) native Hawaiian, father and mother, widows or widowers of
the children, widows or widowers of the<b> </b>brothers and sisters, or nieces
and nephews,--the lessee shall designate the person or persons to whom the
lessee directs the lessee's interest in the tract or tracts to vest upon the
lessee's death.  The Hawaiian blood requirements shall not apply to the
descendants of those who are not native<b> </b>Hawaiians but who were entitled
to the leased lands under section 3 of the Act of May 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 777,
779), as amended, or under section 3 of the Act of July 9, 1952 (66 Stat. 511,
513).  In all cases that person or persons need not be eighteen years of age. 
The designation shall be in writing, may be specified at the time of execution
of the lease with a right in the lessee in similar manner to change the
beneficiary at any time and shall be filed with the department and approved by
the department in order to be effective to vest the interests in the successor
or successors so named. </span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     In case of
the death of any lessee, except as hereinabove provided, who has failed to
specify a successor or successors as approved by the department, the department
may select from only the following qualified relatives of the decedent:</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (1)  Husband or
wife; or</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (2)  If there is
no husband or wife, then the children; or</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  If there is no husband, wife, or child, then the
grandchildren; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  If there is no husband, wife, child, or
grandchild, then brothers or sisters; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  If there is no husband, wife, child, grandchild,
brother, or sister, then from the following relatives of the lessee who are
native Hawaiian:  father and mother, widows or widowers of the children, widows
or widowers of the brothers and sisters, or nieces and nephews.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The rights to
the use and occupancy of the tract or tracts may be made effective as of the
date of the death of the lessee.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     In the case
of the death of a lessee leaving no designated successor or successors,
husband, wife, children, grandchildren, or relative qualified to be a lessee of
Hawaiian home lands, the land subject to the lease shall resume its status as
unleased Hawaiian home lands and the department is authorized to lease the land
to a native Hawaiian as provided in this Act.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Upon the death of a lessee who has not
designated a successor and who leaves a spouse not qualified to succeed to the
lease or children not qualified to succeed to the lease, or upon the death of a
lessee leaving no relative qualified to be a lessee of Hawaiian home lands, or
the cancellation of a lease by the department, or the surrender of a lease by
the lessee, the department shall appraise the value of all the improvements and
growing crops or improvements and aquacultural stock, as the case may be, and
shall pay to the nonqualified spouse or the nonqualified children as the lessee
shall have designated prior to the lessee's death, or to the legal
representative of the deceased lessee, or to the previous<b> </b>lessee, as the
case may be, the value thereof, less any indebtedness to the department, or for
taxes, or for any other indebtedness the payment of which has been assured by
the department, owed by the deceased lessee or the previous<b> </b>lessee. 
These payments shall be made out of the Hawaiian home loan fund and shall be
considered an advance therefrom and shall be repaid by the successor or
successors to the tract involved.  If available cash in the Hawaiian home loan
fund is insufficient to make these payments, payments may be advanced from the
Hawaiian home general loan fund and shall be repaid by the successor or
successors to the tract involved; provided that any repayment for advances made
from the Hawaiian home general loan fund shall be at the interest rate
established by the department for loans made from the Hawaiian home general
loan fund.  The successor or successors may be required by the commission to
obtain private financing in accordance with section 208(6) to pay off the
amount advanced from the Hawaiian home loan fund or Hawaiian home general loan
fund.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The appraisal of improvements and growing
crops, or stock, if any, shall be made by any one of the following methods:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  By a disinterested appraiser hired by the
department;  provided that the previous lessee or deceased lessee's legal
representative shall not be charged for the cost of the appraisal; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  By one disinterested appraiser mutually agreeable
to both the department and the previous lessee or the deceased lessee's legal
representative, with the cost of appraisal borne equally by the two parties; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  By not more than three disinterested appraisers
of which the first shall be contracted for and paid by the department.  If the
previous lessee or the deceased lessee's legal representative does not agree
with the appraised value, the previous lessee or the deceased lessee's legal
representative shall contract with and pay for the services of a second
appraiser whose appraisal report shall be submitted to the department not later
than ninety days from the date of the first appraisal report; provided that the
first appraisal shall be used if the second appraiser is not hired within
thirty days from the date the department transmits the first appraisal report
to the previous lessee or the deceased lessee's representative.  If the
appraisal values are different and a compromise value between the two
appraisals is not reached, a third appraisal shall be made by an appraiser
appointed by the first two appraisers not later than ninety days from the date
of the second appraisal report and the third appraiser shall determine the
final value.  The cost of the third appraisal shall be borne equally by the
department and the previous lessee or the deceased lessee's legal
representative.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The department may adopt rules not in conflict
with this section to establish appraisal procedures, including the time period
by which the department and the previous lessee or the deceased lessee's legal
representative shall act on appraisal matters.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If a previous lessee has abandoned the
tract or tracts or cannot be located after at least two attempts to contact the
previous lessee by certified mail, the department by public notice published at
least once in each of four successive weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation in the State shall give notice to the previous lessee that the
lease will be canceled in accordance with sections 210 and 216 of this title
and the department will appraise the value of the improvements and growing
crops and stock, if any, if the previous lessee does not present himself or
herself within one hundred and twenty days from the first day of publication of
the notice.  Following cancellation of the lease and appraisal of the
improvements and growing crops and stock, if any, the department shall make the
payout as provided in subsection (a).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  After the cancellation of a lease by the
department in accordance with sections 210 and 216 of this title, or the
surrender of a lease by a lessee, the department may transfer the lease or
issue a new lease to any qualified native Hawaiian regardless of whether or not
that person is related in any way by blood or marriage to the previous lessee.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  If any successor or successors to a tract
is a minor or minors, the department may appoint a guardian therefor, subject
to the approval of the court of proper jurisdiction.  The guardian shall be
authorized to represent the successor or successors in all matters pertaining
to the leasehold; provided that the guardian, in so representing the successor
or successors, shall comply with this title and the stipulations and provisions
contained in the lease, except that the guardian need not be a native Hawaiian
as defined in section 201 of this title. [Am Jul. 10, 1937, c 482, 50 Stat 504;

and successor's interest vests only upon lessee's death; private agreement
