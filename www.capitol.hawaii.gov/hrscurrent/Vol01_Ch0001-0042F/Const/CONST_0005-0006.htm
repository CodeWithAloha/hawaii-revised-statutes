AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>AND
DEPARTMENTS</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>Section 6.</b>  All executive and
administrative offices, departments and instrumentalities of the state
government and their respective powers and duties shall be allocated by law
among and within not more than twenty principal departments in such a manner as
to group the same according to common purposes and related functions. 
Temporary commissions or agencies for special purposes may be established by
law and need not be allocated within a principal department.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Each principal department shall be under the
supervision of the governor and, unless otherwise provided in this constitution
or by law, shall be headed by a single executive.  Such single executive shall
be nominated and, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, appointed
by the governor.  That person shall hold office for a term to expire at the end
of the term for which the governor was elected, unless sooner removed by the
governor; except that the removal of the chief legal officer of the State shall
be subject to the advice and consent of the senate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Except as otherwise provided in this
constitution, whenever a board, commission or other body shall be the head of a
principal department of the state government, the members thereof shall be
nominated and, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, appointed by
the governor.  The term of office and removal of such members shall be as
provided by law.  Such board, commission or other body may appoint a principal
executive officer who, when authorized by law, may be an ex officio, voting
member thereof, and who may be removed by a majority vote of the members
appointed by the governor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The governor shall nominate and, by and with
the advice and consent of the senate, appoint all officers for whose election
or appointment provision is not otherwise provided for by this constitution or
by law.  If the manner of removal of an officer is not prescribed in this
constitution, removal shall be as provided by law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     When the senate is not in session and a vacancy
occurs in any office, appointment to which requires the confirmation of the
senate, the governor may fill the office by granting a commission which shall
expire, unless such appointment is confirmed, at the end of the next session of
the senate.  The person so appointed shall not be eligible for another interim
appointment to such office if the appointment failed to be confirmed by the
senate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     No person who has been nominated for
appointment to any office and whose appointment has not received the consent of
the senate shall be eligible to an interim appointment thereafter to such
office.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Every officer appointed under the provisions of
this section shall be a citizen of the United States and shall have been a
resident of this State for at least one year immediately preceding that
person's appointment, except that this residency requirement shall not apply to
the president of the University of Hawaii. [Am Const Con 1968 and election
Nov&nbsp;5, 1968; ren and am Const Con 1978 and election Nov&nbsp;7, 1978]</p>
