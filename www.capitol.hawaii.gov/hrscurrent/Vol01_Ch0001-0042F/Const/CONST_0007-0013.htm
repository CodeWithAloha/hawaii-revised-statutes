<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>DEBT
LIMIT; EXCLUSIONS</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>Section 13.</b>  General obligation bonds
may be issued by the State; provided that such bonds at the time of issuance
would not cause the total amount of principal and interest payable in the
current or any future fiscal year, whichever is higher, on such bonds and on
all outstanding general obligation bonds to exceed:  a sum equal to twenty
percent of the average of the general fund revenues of the State in the three
fiscal years immediately preceding such issuance until June&nbsp;30, 1982; and
thereafter, a sum equal to eighteen and one-half percent of the average of the
general fund revenues of the State in the three fiscal years immediately
preceding such issuance.  Effective July&nbsp;1, 1980, the legislature shall
include a declaration of findings in every general law authorizing the issuance
of general obligation bonds that the total amount of principal and interest,
estimated for such bonds and for all bonds authorized and unissued and
calculated for all bonds issued and outstanding, will not cause the debt limit
to be exceeded at the time of issuance.  Any bond issue by or on behalf of the
State may exceed the debt limit if an emergency condition is declared to exist
by the governor and concurred to by a two-thirds vote of the members to which
each house of the legislature is entitled.  For the purpose of this paragraph,
general fund revenues of the State shall not include moneys received as grants
from the federal government and receipts in reimbursement of any reimbursable
general obligation bonds which are excluded as permitted by this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     A sum equal to fifteen percent of the total of
the assessed values for tax rate purposes of real property in each political
subdivision, as determined by the last tax assessment rolls pursuant to law, is
established as the limit of the funded debt of such political subdivision that
is outstanding and unpaid at any time.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     All general obligation bonds for a term
exceeding two years shall be in serial form maturing in substantially equal
installments of principal, or maturing in substantially equal installments of
both principal and interest.  The first installment of principal of general
obligation bonds and of reimbursable general obligation bonds shall mature not
later than five years from the date of issue of such series.  The last
installment on general obligation bonds shall mature not later than twenty-five
years from the date of such issue and the last installment on general
obligation bonds sold to the federal government, on reimbursable general
obligation bonds and on bonds constituting instruments of indebtedness under
which the State or a political subdivision incurs a contingent liability as a
guarantor shall mature not later than thirty-five years from the date of such
issue.  The interest and principal payments of general obligation bonds shall
be a first charge on the general fund of the State or political subdivision, as
the case may be.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In determining the power of the State to issue
general obligation bonds or the funded debt of any political subdivision under
section 12, the following shall be excluded:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     1.  Bonds that have matured, or that mature in
the then current fiscal year, or that have been irrevocably called for
redemption and the redemption date has occurred or will occur in the then
fiscal year, or for the full payment of which moneys or securities have been
irrevocably set aside.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     2.  Revenue bonds, if the issuer thereof is
obligated by law to impose rates, rentals and charges for the use and services
of the public undertaking, improvement or system or the benefits of a loan
program or a loan thereunder or to impose a user tax, or to impose a
combination of rates, rentals and charges and user tax, as the case may be,
sufficient to pay the cost of operation, maintenance and repair, if any, of the
public undertaking, improvement or system or the cost of maintaining a loan
program or a loan thereunder and the required payments of the principal of and
interest on all revenue bonds issued for the public undertaking, improvement or
system or loan program, and if the issuer is obligated to deposit such revenues
or tax or a combination of both into a special fund and to apply the same to
such payments in the amount necessary therefor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     3.  Special purpose revenue bonds, if the
issuer thereof is required by law to contract with a person obligating such
person to make rental or other payments to the issuer in an amount at least
sufficient to make the required payment of the principal of and interest on
such special purpose revenue bonds.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     4.  Bonds issued under special improvement
statutes when the only security for such bonds is the properties benefited or
improved or the assessments thereon.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     5.  General obligation bonds issued for
assessable improvements, but only to the extent that reimbursements to the
general fund for the principal and interest on such bonds are in fact made from
assessment collections available therefor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     6.  Reimbursable general obligation bonds
issued for a public undertaking, improvement or system but only to the extent
that reimbursements to the general fund are in fact made from the net revenue,
or net user tax receipts, or combination of both, as determined for the
immediately preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     7.  Reimbursable general obligation bonds
issued by the State for any political subdivision, whether issued before or
after the effective date of this section, but only for as long as reimbursement
by the political subdivision to the State for the payment of principal and
interest on such bonds is required by law; provided that in the case of bonds
issued after the effective date of this section, the consent of the governing
body of the political subdivision has first been obtained; and provided further
that during the period that such bonds are excluded by the State, the principal
amount then outstanding shall be included within the funded debt of such
political subdivision.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     8.  Bonds constituting instruments of
indebtedness under which the State or any political subdivision incurs a
contingent liability as a guarantor, but only to the extent the principal
amount of such bonds does not exceed seven percent of the principal amount of
outstanding general obligation bonds not otherwise excluded under this section;
provided that the State or political subdivision shall establish and maintain a
reserve in an amount in reasonable proportion to the outstanding loans
guaranteed by the State or political subdivision as provided by law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     9.  Bonds issued by or on behalf of the State
or by any political subdivision to meet appropriations for any fiscal period in
anticipation of the collection of revenues for such period or to meet casual
deficits or failures of revenue, if required to be paid within one year, and
bonds issued by or on behalf of the State to suppress insurrection, to repel
invasion, to defend the State in war or to meet emergencies caused by disaster
or act of God.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The total outstanding indebtedness of the State
or funded debt of any political subdivision and the exclusions therefrom
permitted by this section shall be made annually and certified by law or as
provided by law.  For the purposes of section 12 and this section, amounts
received from on-street parking may be considered and treated as revenues of a
parking undertaking.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Nothing in section 12 or in this section shall
prevent the refunding of any bond at any time. [Am Const Con 1968 and election
Nov&nbsp;5, 1968; ren and am Const Con 1978 and election Nov&nbsp;7, 1978]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Revenue bonds for state ferry system.  Att. Gen. Op. 65-19.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The effective date of the legislative act authorizing the

issued under this paragraph.  Att. Gen. Op. 72-11.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The two-thirds vote requirement for issuance of bonds applies
to final reading of measure.  Att. Gen. Op. 73-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where appropriations for operating costs and authorization
for bond issues are contained in a single bill, the invalidity of one portion
will not void the other, the matters being severable.  Att. Gen. Op. 73-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Item (e):  Reimbursements to general fund need not be
restricted to reimbursements from the revenues and user taxes for the
&quot;immediately preceding fiscal year&quot;.  Att. Gen. Op. 74-9.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Revenue bonds authorized by 1993 Hawaii state legislature
pursuant to Act 7, §24 [L Sp 1993] for proposed convention center development
and construction qualified for exclusion from debt limit mandated by this
section; reimbursable general obligation bonds authorized by the legislature

construction did not qualify for exclusion under paragraph (6).  78 H. 157, 890
P.2d 1197.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Financing agreements entered into in accordance with chapter 37D
are not bonds as that term is used in article VII, §12 of Hawaii constitution
and thus do not count toward the debt ceiling of this section.  85 H. 1, 936
