<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  For purposes of this section, the permits
or approvals required by law shall include compliance with the requirements for
permits or approvals established by chapters 6E, 46, 54, 171, 174C, 180C, 183,

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under this section, attorneys' fees may be awarded to:  (1) a
member of the public who prevails against a private party who has been or is
undertaking development without obtaining all permits or approvals required by
law from governmental agencies; and (2) a defendant private party who prevails
against a plaintiff who has brought a frivolous suit.  86 H. 132, 948 P.2d 122
(1997).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff's claims were not frivolous, award of
attorneys' fees to defendants not warranted under this section.  86 H. 132, 948
P.2d 122 (1997).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where nothing in this section indicates that this section
should provide the exclusive means for awarding attorney's fees and costs
against a party for a violation of chapter 343, this section was not the
exclusive means for awarding attorney's fees and costs for violations of
chapter 343; also, this section did not prevent an award of attorney's fees
against defendant Superferry pursuant to the private attorney general
doctrine.  120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was no record in the case that defendant Superferry
qualified under subsection (e) as a private party that was &quot;undertaking
development without obtaining all permits or approvals required by law&quot;,
trial court erred in awarding plaintiff attorney's fees and costs against
defendant based on this section.  120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In the circumstances of the case, art. XI, §9 of the Hawaii 
constitution created a private right of action to enforce chapter 205, and the
legislature confirmed the existence of that right of action by enacting this
section, which allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees in such actions;
chapter 205 is a law relating to environmental quality within the meaning of art.
XI, §9, section 9 is self-executing, and §205-12 imposes &quot;reasonable
limitations and regulations&quot; that were applicable to the case which
allowed the private right of action to enforce chapter 205.  123 H. 391, 235
P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
