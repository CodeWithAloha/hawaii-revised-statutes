<p class=ASubparagraph>          (A)  Establishing paternity, if necessary;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  Locating an absent parent who is present
in the State and against whom any action is being taken under a Title IV-D

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (C)  Securing compliance by an absent parent
with a support order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in any other
state;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Perform periodic checks of whether a parent is

provided by the agency under the state plan; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  Each support order established or modified
in the State on or after October 1, 1998.</p>

<p class=1ParagraphContd>          The records shall use standardized data
elements for both parents, including but not limited to names, residential and
mailing addresses, telephone numbers, driver's license numbers, social security
numbers and other uniform identification numbers, dates of birth, case
identification numbers, and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the
parents' employers, and contain any other information as required by the United
States Secretary of Health and Human Services.  In each case, with respect to
subparagraph (A) and where a support order has been established, the case
record shall include the amount of monthly or other periodic support owed under
the order, and other amounts, including but not limited to arrearages, due
under the order, the amounts collected under the order, the birthdate of any
child for whom the order requires the provision of support, and the amount of
any lien imposed;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (13)  Perform other duties required under chapter 576B,
the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (14)  Perform other duties required under Title IV-D.</p>
