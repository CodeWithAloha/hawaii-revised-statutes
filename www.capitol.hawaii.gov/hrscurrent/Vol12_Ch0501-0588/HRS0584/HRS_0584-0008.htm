<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§584-8</b>  <b>Jurisdiction; venue.  </b>(a) 
Without limiting the jurisdiction of any other court, the family court has
jurisdiction of an action brought under this chapter.  The action may be joined
with an action for divorce, annulment, separate maintenance, or support.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A person who has sexual intercourse in
this State thereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State as
to an action brought under this chapter with respect to a child who may have
been conceived by that act of intercourse.  In addition to any other method
provided by statute, personal jurisdiction may be acquired by personal service
outside this State or by service by certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid, with return receipt requested.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  In addition to any other method of service
provided by statute or court rule, if the respondent is not found within the
circuit, service may be effectuated by registered or certified mail, with
request for a return receipt and direction to deliver to addressee only.  The
return receipt signed by the respondent shall be prima facie evidence that the
respondent accepted delivery of the complaint and summons on the date set forth
on the receipt.  For service effectuated by registered or certified mail, an
electronic copy or facsimile of the signature of the served individual on
certified mailers provided by the United States Postal Service shall constitute
valid proof of service on the individual.  Actual receipt by the respondent of
the complaint and summons sent by registered or certified mail shall be the
equivalent to personal service on the respondent by an authorized process
server as of the date of the receipt.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If it appears that the respondent has
refused to accept service by registered or certified mail or is concealing
oneself or evading service, or the petitioner does not know the address or
residence of the respondent and has not been able to ascertain the same after
reasonable and due inquiry and search, the court may authorize notice of the
paternity action and the time and date of hearing by publication or by any
other manner that is reasonably calculated to give the party actual notice of
proceedings and an opportunity to be heard, including the following:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  When publication is authorized, the summons shall
be published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a publication of general
circulation in the circuit.  The publication of general circulation shall be
designated by the court in the order for publication of the summons.  Notice by
publication shall have the same force and effect as such person having been
personally served with the summons; provided that the date of the last
publication shall be set not less than twenty-one days prior to the return date
stated in the summons.  Proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or
declaration by the authorized representative for the publication that the
notice was given in the manner prescribed by the court.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  When posting to an online publication website is
authorized, proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or declaration
by the authorized representative for the publication that the notice was given
in the manner prescribed by the court.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  When service by electronic mail or posting to a
social networking account is authorized, proof of service shall be satisfied by
an affidavit or declaration by the process server that the notice was given in
the manner prescribed by the court.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  When service is made by posting to a public
bulletin board, proof of service shall be satisfied by an affidavit or
declaration by the process server that the notice was given in the manner
prescribed by the court.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The action may be brought in the county in
which the child, the mother, or the alleged father resides or is found or in
which the child was born or, if the father is deceased, in which proceedings
for probate of the father's estate have been or could be commenced. [L 1975, c
66, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 300, §1; am L 1996, c 17, §1; am L 2009, c 115, §7;
gen ch 2009; am L 2016, c 83, §1]</p>
