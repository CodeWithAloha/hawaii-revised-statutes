chapter 505;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Unpaid real property taxes assessed against the
land and improvements covered by the certificate of title for the deregistered

priority of any liability and the lien therefor (other than for labor and
material furnished in the improvement of the land, which shall be governed by
section 507-43) shall cease and terminate three years after the liability first
accrues unless notice thereof, signed by the officer charged with collection of
the assessments or liability, setting forth the amount claimed, the date of
accrual, and the land affected, is recorded in the bureau of conveyances
pursuant to chapter 502 within the three-year period; and provided further that
if there are easements or other rights, appurtenant to a parcel of deregistered

encumbrance shall be deemed sufficiently noted on a certificate of title if the
notation:</p>

contains an encumbrance; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Indicates that the referenced document contains
an encumbrance to which the deregistered land is subject.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  All instruments, documents, and papers: 
noted on a certificate of title recorded in the bureau of conveyances pursuant
to chapter 502 and part II of this chapter (in the case of land other than a
fee time share interest); noted on a certified fee time share interest
certificate of title; or noted or deemed to be noted on an uncertified fee time
share interest certificate [of] title, shall have the same force and effect as
if they had been recorded in the bureau of conveyances pursuant to chapter 502
as of the date, hour, and minute of reception noted on the certificate of title
pursuant to section 501-107 or otherwise entered or required to be entered in
the record of the assistant registrar pursuant to section 501-107; provided
that:</p>

constructive notice or otherwise, than it had or acquired at the time it was
registered pursuant to this chapter or made; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Nothing in this part shall be construed as giving
any greater or other effect, as constructive notice or otherwise, to any
instrument, document, or paper recorded in the bureau of conveyances pursuant
to chapter 502 prior to the date and time of deregistration of any registered
land, than was provided by the laws of this State (including this chapter and
other laws regarding registered land) in effect at the time the instrument,
document, or paper was recorded.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  If a certificate of title for:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Land other than a fee time share interest
recorded in the bureau of conveyances pursuant to chapter 502 and part II of
this chapter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A fee time share interest certified by the
assistant registrar; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A fee time share interest that has not been
certified by the assistant registrar,</p>

more than one interest in other deregistered land, then subsections (a) to (d)
shall apply to each interest separately and only those items described in
subsections (a) to (d) that encumbered a particular interest as of the date and
time of deregistration of that interest will continue to encumber that interest
after the date and time of deregistration. [L 2009, c 120, pt of §2, §21; am L
