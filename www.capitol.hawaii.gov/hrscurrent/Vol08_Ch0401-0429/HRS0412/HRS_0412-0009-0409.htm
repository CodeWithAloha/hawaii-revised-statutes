cent of the depository financial services loan company's capital and surplus;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Securities and obligations of quasi-United States

Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European
Investment Bank, and other multilateral lending institutions in which the United
States government is a shareholder or contributing member; provided that the
total amount invested in any one issuer shall not exceed twenty per cent of the
depository financial services loan company's capital and surplus.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A depository financial services loan
company may invest its own assets in bonds, securities, or similar obligations
issued by this State or any county of this State, through an appropriate agency
or instrumentality.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  To the extent specified in this
subsection, a depository financial services loan company may invest its own
assets in bonds or similar obligations issued by any state of the United States
other than this State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession
of the United States, by municipal governments of these states, territories, or

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  To the extent specified in this
subsection, a depository financial services loan company may invest its own

grade&quot; means notes, bonds, certificates of interest or participation, beneficial
interests, mortgage or receivable-related securities, and other obligations
that are commonly understood to be of investment grade quality including,
without limitation, those securities that are rated within the four highest
grades by any nationally-recognized rating service or unrated securities of
similar quality as reasonably determined by the depository financial services
loan company in its prudent judgment, which may be based in part upon estimates
which it believes to be reliable.  Investment grade does not include
investments which are predominantly speculative in nature.  The aggregate
amount invested by a depository financial services loan company under this
subsection and subsections (d) and (g)(3) in any one company or other issuer shall
not exceed twenty per cent of the depository financial services loan company's
capital and surplus.  Subject to the approval of the commissioner, the twenty
per cent limitation shall not apply to investment grade securities secured
entirely by mortgage loans originated by the depository financial services loan
company.  In approving any transaction under this section, the commissioner may
impose any conditions to ensure the safety and soundness of the institution.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  To the extent specified in this subsection,

the depository financial services loan company is carried on, other space in

services loan company's business, including but not limited to parking

where the depository financial services loan company in good faith expects to
utilize the property as depository financial services loan company premises;
provided, if the depository financial services loan company ceases to use any
real property and improvements thereon for one of the foregoing purposes, it,
within five years thereafter, shall sell the real property or cease to carry it
as an asset; provided further, the property, without the approval of the
commissioner, shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the depository
financial services loan company's capital and surplus;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Personal property used in or necessary for the
accommodation of the depository financial services loan company's business,
including but not limited to furniture, fixtures, equipment, vaults, and safety
deposit boxes; provided that the depository financial services loan company's
investment in furniture and fixtures, without the approval of the commissioner,
shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of the depository financial services loan

depository financial services loan company acquires for purposes of leasing to
third parties and any real property interests that is incidental thereto;</p>

that may come into its possession as security for loans or in the collection of
debts; or that may be purchased by or conveyed to the depository financial
services loan company in satisfaction of or on account of debts previously
contracted in the course of its business, when the property was held as
security by the depository financial services loan company; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The seller's interest under an agreement of sale,
as that term is defined in sections 501-101.5 and 502-85 including, without
limitation, the reversionary interest in the real property and the right to
income under the agreement of sale, with or without recourse to the seller.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Except as otherwise authorized in this section,
any tangible personal property coming into the possession of any depository
financial services loan company pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be disposed of
as soon as practicable and, without the written consent of the commissioner,
shall not be considered a part of the assets of the depository financial
services loan company after the expiration of two years from the date of
acquisition.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Except as otherwise authorized in this section,
any real property acquired by a depository financial services loan company
pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be sold or exchanged for other real property by
the depository financial services loan company within five years after title thereto
has vested in it by purchase or otherwise, or within any further time that may
be extended by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Any depository financial services loan company
acquiring any real property in any manner other than provided by this section
immediately, upon receiving notice from the commissioner, shall charge the same

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Companies listed on the New York or American
stock exchanges or on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations; provided that the aggregate amount invested by a depository
financial services loan company under this paragraph and subsections (d) and
(e) in any one corporation shall not exceed twenty per cent of the depository
financial services loan company's capital and surplus.</p>
