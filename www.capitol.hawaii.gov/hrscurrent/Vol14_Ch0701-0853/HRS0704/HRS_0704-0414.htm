<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §704-414</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section provides for the appointment of independent
examiners for the purpose of reporting and possibly testifying on the former
defendant's condition prior to action on an application for discharge,
conditional release, or modification of conditions of release.  The procedure
for examination is substantially similar to that prescribed for the initial
determination of the issues of fitness to proceed and penal responsibility;
however, the relevant condition is the person's present condition and the
relevant criterion is whether the application can be granted without danger to
the person himself, or to the person or property of others.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Prior Hawaii law merely required &quot;proof of termination
of... [the committed person's] insanity.&quot;[1]  The mandatory requirement of
an independent review before change in commitment or conditional release status
is an addition to the law.  It affords the defendant and the public a more
deliberate determination of the application.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §704-414</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In conformity with the changes made in §§704-404 and 411, Act
54, Session Laws 1974, also changed §704-414 to permit the use of one certified
clinical psychologist as part of the examination panel.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 3, Session Laws 1979, modified the requirements for the
composition of examination panels to allow the courts greater flexibility in
appointing mental health professionals.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 314, Session Laws 1986, amended &quot;certified clinical
psychologists&quot; to &quot;licensed psychologists.&quot;  This change was
made because psychologists are licensed and not certified and the term &quot;clinical&quot;
does not accurately describe psychologists qualified to determine penal
responsibility and fitness to proceed.  Act 314 also provided an exception to
the licensure requirement which recognizes that under §465-3(4), psychologists
employed under government certification or civil service rules are exempt from
the licensure requirement.  Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 145, Session Laws 1987, permitted the department of
health to set minimum standards for participation and appointment of a sanity
examiner.  The legislature felt this change would allow additional assurances
of higher quality testimony by these examiners.  Senate Standing Committee Report
No. 691, House Standing Committee Report No. 1217.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 305, Session Laws 1988, included licensed psychologists
among the professionals which may provide offender examination services to the Hawaii criminal justice system.  The legislature stated that the present laws, which permit
only psychiatric evaluation, are inconsistent with the many and varied uses the
court has found for the services of licensed psychologists.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 2153.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 88, Session Laws 1992, made technical amendments to the
section for purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 2579.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 306, Session Laws 1997, amended this section to allow
mental health examinations to be conducted by one rather than three examiners
in nonfelony cases, and to require three examiners, which include at least one
psychiatrist and one psychologist, in felony cases.  The amendment streamlines
the process for committing and releasing mentally incompetent defendants. 
Conference Committee Report No. 64.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by omitting
in the sixth sentence, the words &quot;and participate in&quot; from the phrase
that formerly read &quot;to witness and participate in the examination.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 198, Session Laws 2016, amended this section by making
conforming amendments.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2261.  Act 198
also amended this section by adding the definition of &quot;qualified
physician.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to implement
recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to
House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).</p>
