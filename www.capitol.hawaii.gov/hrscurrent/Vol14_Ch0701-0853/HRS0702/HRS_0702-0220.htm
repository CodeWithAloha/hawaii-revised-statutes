<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §702-220</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section deals with a special type of ignorance or
mistake of law--mistaken belief by the defendant that the defendant's conduct
is not legally prohibited by the penal law.  It must, in most instances, be
held that such a mistaken belief will afford no excuse because recognition of
this defense would allow each individual to define the limits of application of
a penal statute by claiming that, because of the individual's ignorance or
mistake, the proscription of the statute is not applicable to the individual.</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>     Just as a
judgment of criminality cannot be imposed unless the conduct in question has
been defined as criminal, so, once the conduct has been so defined, one cannot
usurp the lawmaking function by pleading that his ignorance must mean that the
conduct is not criminal as to him.  That doctrine is just, so long as the
behavior content of the criminal law is coterminous with the knowledge that a
member of the community may be expected to have about the limits of tolerable
behavior.  But, in fact, the criminal law has been indiscriminately employed to
proscribe conduct that does not carry its own warning of illegality....
Nonetheless, ... [the first offender] has no defense under prevailing law. 
Therein resides a major dilemma.[1]</p>

<p class=XNotes>In order to avoid manifest injustice, the Code allows a limited
affirmative defense in certain cases.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The defense is afforded where the defendant acts in
reasonable reliance on an official statement of the law afterwards determined
to be erroneous.  In such cases the defendant's conduct is consistent with
law-abidingness.  Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that official statements
of the law must sometime be overruled, no social purpose would be served by
discouraging reasonable reliance on them while they stand.  Certainly penal
liability for such reasonable reliance is inconsistent with the concept of
culpability which permeates this Code.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Hawaii has recognized the doctrine that the defendant will
not be afforded a defense based on the defendant's ignorance that the
defendant's conduct is prohibited by the penal law.[2]  The limited defense
afforded by this section of the Code has not previously been available; it has
however been adopted or proposed in other states.[3]</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §702-220</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 220 of the Proposed Draft of the Code had provided
for an affirmative defense when &quot;the statute or other enactment defining
the offense is not known to the defendant and has not been reasonably made
available to him, by publication or otherwise, prior to the conduct or result
alleged.&quot;  This affirmative defense, based on obscure publication or
unavailability of the content of the penal law, was deleted by the legislature for
the reasons set forth in Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972), the relevant
portion of which is quoted in the Supplemental Commentary on §702-218.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In State v. Marley, 54 H. 450, 476-477, 509 P.2d 1095,
1111-1112 (1973), the court recognized mistake of law as a defense.  The court
said:  &quot;It is true that reasonable mistake of law is often a complete
defense to the charge of criminality for an act when the mistake of law
negatives a mental state which must be shown to establish a material element of
the crime....  Therefore, defendants' 'honest' and 'reasonable' belief that
they had a right or duty to be present on Honeywell property, in that they had
a defense assertable under American treaty law--no matter how incorrect such a
belief might be--would have exonerated defendants by negativing the mental
state that is an essential element of the crime.  Instruction 24, supra, given
by the court enunciated the gist of this defense.  The jury could have
acquitted the defendants on this instruction, even though defendants disclaimed
any reliance on a 'mistake' of law justification defense.  The jury chose not
to do so&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As 911 telephone operator not the public officer or body
charged by law with responsibility for interpretation, administration, or
enforcement of the law defining the offense, paragraph (4) affirmative defense
not applicable.  81 H. 147 (App.), 913 P.2d 558 (1996).</p>
