<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §701-114  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</b> 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in section 701-115, no person may be
convicted of an offense unless the following are proved beyond a reasonable
doubt:</p>

<p class=aPenalBlock>     (a)  Each element of the offense;</p>

<p class=aPenalBlock>     (b)  The state of mind required to establish each
element of the offense;</p>

<p class=aPenalBlock>     (d)  Facts establishing venue; and</p>

<p class=aPenalBlock>     (e)  Facts establishing that the offense was
committed within the time period specified in section 701-108.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  In the absence of the proof required by
subsection (1), the innocence of the defendant is presumed. [L 1972, c 9, pt of

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §701-114</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section announces the usual burden of proof in criminal
cases; the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  The
matters which must be so proved are spelled out in detail.  They include
elements of the offense, the requisite state of mind, and facts establishing
jurisdiction, venue, and timeliness.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §701-114</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 114(2) of the Proposed Draft of the Code had provided
that the &quot;innocence of the defendant is assumed.&quot;  The legislature found
that &quot;the use of the word 'assumed' in this manner is novel and prefers
the term 'presumed' since it has a definite meaning in jurisprudence.&quot; 
Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 136, Session Laws 1973, amended this section by adding
the introductory phrase now contained in subsection (1) (&quot;Except as
otherwise provided in section 701-115, ...&quot;) to eliminate the possibility
of confusion in the application of §§701-114 and 701-115.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appearance in court by defendant did not waive right to
insist that State prove venue.  66 H. 530, 668 P.2d 32 (1983).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State need not establish jurisdiction of trial court by
proving defendant is over eighteen years of age.  67 H. 68, 678 P.2d. 1080
(1984).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt not established where trial
judge found defendant guilty based on substantial credible evidence.  72 H.
296, 815 P.2d 1025 (1991).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Requirements of HRPP rule 18 and article I, §14 of Hawaii
constitution having been satisfied, venue was proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.  78 H. 185, 891 P.2d 272 (1995).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State tax maps could not be used to establish venue in DUI
prosecution where maps did not represent legislatively authorized schematics of
official district boundaries for non-taxation purposes.  80 H. 291, 909 P.2d
1106 (1995).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Officer's testimony regarding Ewa boundary of Honolulu
district, being probative of &quot;facts establishing venue&quot; under this
section, was relevant and admissible under chapter 626, rule 803(b)(20).  80 H.
297, 909 P.2d 1112 (1995).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Testimony of officer supplemented with tax map information
which court could have taken judicial notice of pursuant to chapter 626, rule
201, constituted substantial evidence supporting &quot;facts establishing venue&quot;
with respect to DUI offense.  80 H. 297, 909 P.2d 1112 (1995).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant requested court to instruct jury on
time-barred lesser included offense of simple trespass under §708-815,
defendant waived statute of limitations under subsection (1)(e).  87 H. 108,
952 P.2d 865 (1997).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's right to have all elements of an offense proven
beyond a reasonable doubt was statutorily protected under this section and
constitutionally protected under the Hawaii and federal constitutions; as only
defendant personally could have waived such fundamental right and such right
could not have been waived or stipulated to by defendant's counsel, stipulation
by defendant's counsel of the fact that defendant committed defendant's crime
within two years of a second or prior conviction of abuse for purposes of the
§709-906(7) charge violated defendant's due process rights.  116 H. 3, 169 P.3d
955 (2007).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court erred in convicting defendant for illegal camping
pursuant to county ordinance where there was insufficient evidence adduced at
trial to show that defendant illegally camped &quot;in any park not designated
as a campground&quot; because the evidence at trial established that the beach
park was designated as a campground and defendant was in the designated camping
area on the night defendant was cited.  123 H. 369, 235 P.3d 365 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that the
offense, or at least a &quot;part of it&quot; occurred on the island of Oahu, a
reasonable mind could have &quot;fairly concluded&quot; that the events
occurred on the island of Oahu; thus, venue in the first circuit was
established beyond a reasonable doubt.  131 H. 365, 319 P.3d 284 (2013).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Failure to instruct jury as to venue and timeliness of
prosecution is error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  5 H. App. 644, 706
P.2d 1321 (1985).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State proved jurisdictional facts beyond a reasonable doubt. 
8 H. App. 497, 810 P.2d 668 (1991).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Failure to instruct jury on state of mind element under
§134-7, as required by subsection (1)(b), was prejudicial and not harmless
error.  78 H. 422 (App.), 895 P.2d 173 (1995).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Judicial notice taken that trial, being held in first
circuit, was held in proper circuit.  78 H. 422 (App.), 895 P.2d 173 (1995).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where, under subsection (1)(a), proof of each element of an
offense is required for a conviction, and the term &quot;habitual&quot; or &quot;habitual
operator&quot; in the indictment did not convey the narrow definition that the
person charged with habitually operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant had to have three or more convictions within the previous ten years,
the phrase &quot;habitual operator&quot; did not provide adequate notice to
defendant what the State was required to prove as an element of the offense;
thus, defendant's conviction vacated.  128 H. 132 (App.), 284 P.3d 905 (2012).</p>
