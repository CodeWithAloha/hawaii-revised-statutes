<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§707-711  Assault in the second degree.</b>

L 1987, c 257, §1; am L 1988, c 279, §1; am L 2006, c 230, §29 and c 298, §16;

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §§707-710 TO 707-712</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended §707-711(1) to implement
recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to
House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Law Journals and Reviews</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Cruelty to Animals:  Recognizing Violence Against Nonhuman
Victims.  23 UH L. Rev. 307 (2000).</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Assault in the third degree is not a lesser included
offense.  68 H. 276, 711 P.2d 1289 (1985).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Circuit court was obligated, even absent a request by either
party, to instruct the jury regarding the included offense of assault in the third
degree where appellant was charged with committing offense of assault in the second
degree; court's failure to do so constituted plain error.  76 H. 387, 879 P.2d
492 (1994).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Conviction of defendant of offense of carrying, using or
threatening to use a firearm in the commission of a separate felony under
§134-6(a) and (e), the separate felony being second degree assault under
subsection (1)(a), vacated where there was no substantial evidence that
defendant caused substantial bodily injury to victim as required under
subsection (1)(a).  94 H. 241, 11 P.3d 466 (2000).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The plain and unambiguous language of §853-4(2) does not
prohibit the grant of a deferred acceptance of no contest plea for assault in
the second degree under this section causing &quot;substantial bodily injury&quot;,
as statutory prohibition expressly applies only to felony and misdemeanor
assaults inflicting &quot;bodily injury&quot; or &quot;serious bodily injury&quot;. 
101 H. 409, 70 P.3d 635 (2003).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Court's failure to personally engage defendant in
on-the-record colloquy to determine whether defendant understood consequences
of foregoing right to have jury instructed on third degree assault, the
lesser-included offense of second degree assault, constituted plain error.  85
H. 44 (App.), 936 P.2d 1292 (1997).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court's omission of the &quot;strongly corroborative&quot;
paragraph in the attempted assault in the second degree instructions was
presumptively prejudicial and omission was not harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt.  104 H. 517 (App.), 92 P.3d 1027 (2004).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although the evidence was insufficient to show that defendant
committed the offense of first degree assault, there was ample evidence to show
that the victim's injury satisfied the definition of &quot;substantial bodily
injury&quot; under §707-700 and that defendant thus committed the lesser
included offense of second degree assault in violation of subsection (1)(a);
thus the jury, having returned a guilty verdict against defendant for first
degree assault, must also have found sufficient evidence to prove the lesser
included offense of second degree assault.  116 H. 445 (App.), 173 P.3d 592
(2007).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Cited:  55 H. 531, 534, 523 P.2d 299 (1974).</p>
