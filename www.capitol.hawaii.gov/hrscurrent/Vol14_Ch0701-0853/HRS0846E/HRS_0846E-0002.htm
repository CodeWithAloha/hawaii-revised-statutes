A covered offender shall register with the attorney general and comply with the
provisions of this chapter for life or for a shorter period of time as provided
in this chapter.  Registration under this subsection is required whenever the
covered offender, whether or not a resident of this State, remains in this
State for more than ten days or for an aggregate period exceeding thirty days
in one calendar year.  A covered offender shall be eligible to petition the court
in a civil proceeding for an order that the covered offender's registration
requirements under this chapter be terminated, as provided in section 846E-10.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A person who establishes or maintains a
residence in this State and who has not been designated as a covered offender
by a court of this State but who has been designated as a covered offender, sex

predator, or any other sexual offender designation in another state or jurisdiction
and was, as a result of such designation, subjected to registration or

resident of that state or jurisdiction, without regard to whether the person
otherwise meets the criteria for registration as a covered offender, shall
register in the manner provided in this section and shall be subject to
community and public notification as provided in section 846E-3.  A person who

issued, which states that such designation has been removed or demonstrates to <a
name=Document2zzSDUNumber18></a>the attorney general that such designation, if
not imposed by a court, has been removed by operation of law or court order in
the state or jurisdiction in which the designation was made, and such person
does not meet the criteria for registration as a covered offender under the
laws of this State; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Demonstrating that the out-of-state convictions
upon which the sexual offender designation was established are not covered
offenses under section 846E-1, thereby showing that such person does not meet
the criteria for registration as a covered offender under the laws of this
State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>If the covered offender is not satisfied with the
decision of the attorney general on the request for termination of registration
requirements, the covered offender may appeal the decision pursuant to chapter
91.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Each provision of this chapter applicable

when providing notice of a change in registration information, the covered
offender also shall sign a statement verifying that all of the registration
information is accurate and current.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  In addition to the requirement under
subsection (a) to register with the attorney general and comply with the
provisions of this chapter until a court relieves the covered offender of the

State for more than ten days or for an aggregate period exceeding thirty days

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Release from incarceration;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Release from commitment;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Release on furlough;</p>

person every five years until June 30, 2009, and beginning on July 1, 2009,
every year, within the thirty-day period following the offender's date of

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The registration provisions of this
section shall apply to all covered offenders without regard to:</p>

316, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 194, §2; am L 2002, c 234, §1; am L 2003, c 62, §4;
am L 2004, c 59, §2; am L 2005, c 45, §4; am L 2006, c 106, §2; am L 2008, c
80, §5; am L 2013, c 64, §5]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Note</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The 2013 amendment applies to any acts committed prior to,
on, or after April 30, 2013.  L 2013, c 64, §11.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not
interfere with any of a sex offender's protected liberty interests, the
protections of procedural due process are not triggered.  97 H. 285, 36 P.3d
1255 (2001).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The lifetime registration component of the Hawaii sex
offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under the
Hawaii constitution, article I, §5 and requires that minimum requirements of
due process--notice and opportunity to be heard--be afforded to convicted sex
offenders; such a proceeding may be instituted by a sex offender in a special
proceeding.  105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>
