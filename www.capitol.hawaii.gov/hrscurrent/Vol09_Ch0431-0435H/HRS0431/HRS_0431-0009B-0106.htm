<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §431:9B-106  Required contract provisions;
reinsurance intermediary-managers.</b>  Transactions between a reinsurance
intermediary-manager and the reinsurer it represents in that capacity shall
only be entered into pursuant to a written contract, specifying the
responsibilities of each party that shall be approved by the reinsurer's board
of directors.  The contract, at a minimum, shall provide that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The reinsurer may terminate the contract for
cause upon written notice to the reinsurance intermediary-manager.  The
reinsurer may immediately suspend the authority of the reinsurance
intermediary-manager to assume or cede business during the pendency of any
dispute regarding the cause for termination;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The reinsurance intermediary-manager shall render
accounts to the reinsurer accurately detailing all material transactions,
including information necessary to support all commissions, charges, and other
fees received by or owing to the reinsurance intermediary-manager, and remit
all funds due under the contract to the reinsurer on not less than a monthly
basis;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  All funds collected for the reinsurer's account
shall be held by the reinsurance intermediary-manager in a fiduciary capacity
and deposited in a bank that is a qualified United States financial institution.

estimated claims payments and allocated loss adjustment expenses.  The

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  Period of coverage, including effective

limited to, premium and loss accounts; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (K)  When the reinsurance intermediary-manager
places a reinsurance contract on behalf of a ceding insurer:</p>

<p class=iClause>               (i)  Directly from any assuming reinsurer,
written evidence that the assuming reinsurer has agreed to assume the risk; or</p>

<p class=iClause>              (ii)  If placed through a representative of the
assuming reinsurer, other than an employee, written evidence that the reinsurer
has delegated binding authority to the representative;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The reinsurer shall have access and the right to
copy all accounts and records maintained by the reinsurance
intermediary-manager related to its business in a form usable by the reinsurer;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  If the contract permits the reinsurance
intermediary-manager to settle claims on behalf of the reinsurer:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (A)  All claims shall be reported to the
reinsurer in a timely manner;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  A copy of the claim file shall be sent to

property of the reinsurer or its estate; the reinsurance intermediary-manager
shall have reasonable access to and the right to copy the files on a timely
basis; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (D)  Any settlement authority granted to the

authority during the pendency of the dispute regarding the cause of
termination;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  If the contract provides for a sharing of interim
profits by the reinsurance intermediary-manager, interim profits shall not be
paid until one year after the end of each underwriting period for property
business and five years after the end of each underwriting period for casualty
business (or a later period set by the commissioner for specified lines of
insurance) and not until the adequacy of reserves on remaining claims has been
verified pursuant to section 431:9B-108(c);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  The reinsurance intermediary-manager shall
annually provide the reinsurer with a statement of its financial condition

<p class=1Paragraph>    (13)  The reinsurance intermediary-manager shall
disclose to the reinsurer any relationship it has with any insurer prior to
ceding or assuming any business with the insurer pursuant to the contract; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (14)  Within the scope of its actual or apparent
authority the acts of the reinsurance intermediary-manager shall be deemed to
be the acts of the reinsurer on whose behalf it is acting. [L 1992, c 176, pt
