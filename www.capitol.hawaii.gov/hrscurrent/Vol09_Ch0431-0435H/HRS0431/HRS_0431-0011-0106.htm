the insurer's annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For purposes of this article, in
determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable
in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its
financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (1)  The size of the insurer as
measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings,
insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (2)  The extent to which the
insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (3)  The number and size of risks
insured in each line of business;</span></p>

investments in affiliates.  The commissioner may treat any investment as a
disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
policyholders whenever in the commissioner's judgment the investment so
warrants.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In determining the adequacy and
reasonableness of an</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>insurer's surplus, no single factor is necessarily
controlling,</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>and the commissioner shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (1)  Consider the net effect of all
of the factors, along with other factors bearing on the financial condition of
the insurer;</span></p>
