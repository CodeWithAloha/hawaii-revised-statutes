<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§431:10A&#8209;116.3  Coverage for
telehealth.</b>  (a)  It is the intent of the legislature to recognize the
application of telehealth as a reimbursable service by which an individual
shall receive medical services from a health care provider without face-to-face
contact with the provider.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  No accident and health or sickness
insurance plan that is issued, amended, or renewed shall require face-to-face
contact between a health care provider and a patient as a prerequisite for
payment for services appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
with generally accepted health care practices and standards prevailing in the
applicable professional community at the time the services were provided.  The
coverage required in this section may be subject to all terms and conditions of
the plan agreed upon among the enrollee or subscriber, the insurer, and the
provider.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Reimbursement for services provided
through telehealth shall be equivalent to reimbursement for the same services
provided via face-to-face contact between a health care provider and a
patient.  There shall be no reimbursement for a telehealth consultation between
health care providers unless a health care provider-patient relationship exists
between the patient and one of the health care providers involved in the
telehealth interaction and the patient is accompanied by a treating health care
provider at the time telehealth services are provided by the consulting health
care provider; provided that when behavioral health services are provided, a
second health care provider shall not be required to accompany the patient.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     For the purposes of this section, &quot;health
care provider&quot; means a provider of services, as defined in 42 U.S.C.
1395x(u), a provider of medical and other health services, as defined in 42
U.S.C. 1395x(s), and any other person or organization who furnishes, bills, or
is paid for health care in the normal course of business, including but not
limited to primary care providers, mental health providers, oral health
providers, physicians and osteopathic physicians licensed under chapter 453,
advanced practice registered nurses licensed under chapter 457, psychologists
licensed under chapter 465, and dentists licensed under chapter 448.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Notwithstanding chapter 453 or rules
adopted pursuant thereto, in the event that a health care provider-patient
relationship does not exist between the patient and the health care provider to
be involved in a telehealth interaction between the patient and the health care
provider, a telehealth mechanism may be used to establish a health care
provider-patient relationship.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  For the purposes of this section,
&quot;telehealth&quot; means the use of telecommunications services, as defined
in section 269&#8209;1, including but not limited to real-time video conferencing-based
communication, secure interactive and non&#8209;interactive web-based
communication, and secure asynchronous information exchange, to transmit
patient medical information, including diagnostic-quality digital images and
laboratory results for medical interpretation and diagnosis, for the purpose of
delivering enhanced health care services and information to parties separated
by distance.  Standard telephone contacts, facsimile transmissions, or e-mail
text, in combination or by itself, does not constitute a telehealth service for
the purposes of this chapter. [L 1998, c 278, §2; am L 2002, c 155, §56; am L
2006, c 219, §2; am L 2009, c 20, §3; am L 2014, c 159, §3]</p>
