<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  An independent review organization shall
not own or control, be a subsidiary of, or in any way be owned or controlled
by, or exercise control over a health carrier, health benefit plan, a national,

the external review, the plan administrator, or any fiduciary or employee of
the plan.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The commissioner may determine that no material
professional, familial, or financial conflict of interest exists based on the
specific characteristics of a particular relationship or connection that
creates an apparent professional, familial, or financial conflict of interest.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  An independent review organization that is
accredited by a nationally-recognized private accrediting entity that has
independent review accreditation standards that the commissioner has determined
are equivalent to or exceed the minimum qualifications of this section shall be
presumed to be in compliance with this section to be eligible for approval
under this part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The commissioner shall review, initially upon
approval of an accredited independent review organization and periodically
during the time that the independent review organization remains approved
pursuant to this section, the accreditation standards of the
nationally-recognized private accrediting entity to determine whether the
entity's standards are, and continue to be equivalent to, or exceed the minimum
qualifications established under this section; provided that a review conducted
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shall satisfy the
requirements of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Upon request of the commissioner, a
nationally-recognized private accrediting entity shall make its current
independent review organization accreditation standards available to the
commissioner or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in order for
the commissioner to determine if the entity's standards are equivalent to or
exceed the minimum qualifications established under this section.  The
commissioner may exclude any private accrediting entity that is not reviewed by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  An independent review organization shall
establish and maintain written procedures to ensure that it is unbiased in
addition to any other procedures required under this section. [L 2011, c 230,
