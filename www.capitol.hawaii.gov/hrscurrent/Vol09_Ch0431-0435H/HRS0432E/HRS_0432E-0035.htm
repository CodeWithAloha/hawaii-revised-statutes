<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§432E-35  Expedited external review.</b> 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (i), an enrollee or the enrollee's
appointed representative may request an expedited external review with the
commissioner if the enrollee receives:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  An adverse determination that involves a medical
condition of the enrollee for which the time frame for completion of an
expedited internal appeal would seriously jeopardize the enrollee's life,
health, or ability to gain maximum functioning or would subject the enrollee to
severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment
that is the subject of the adverse determination;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A final adverse determination if the enrollee has
a medical condition where the time frame for completion of a standard external
review would seriously jeopardize the enrollee's ability to gain maximum
functioning, or would subject the enrollee to severe pain that cannot be
adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the
adverse determination; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A final adverse determination if the final
adverse determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued
stay, or health care service for which the enrollee received emergency
services; provided that the enrollee has not been discharged from a facility
for health care services related to the emergency services.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Upon receipt of a request for an expedited
external review, the commissioner shall immediately send a copy of the request
to the health carrier.  Immediately upon receipt of the request, the health
carrier shall determine whether the request meets the reviewability
requirements set forth in subsection (a).  The health carrier shall immediately
notify the enrollee or the enrollee's appointed representative of its
determination of the enrollee's eligibility for expedited external review.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Notice of ineligibility for expedited external
review shall include a statement informing the enrollee and the enrollee's
appointed representative that a health carrier's initial determination that an
external review request that is ineligible for review may be appealed to the
commissioner by submission of a request to the commissioner.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Upon receipt of a request for appeal
pursuant to subsection (b), the commissioner shall review the request for expedited
external review submitted pursuant to subsection (a) and, if eligible, shall
refer the enrollee for external review.  The commissioner's determination of
eligibility for expedited external review shall be made in accordance with the
terms of the enrollee's health benefit plan and all applicable provisions of
this part.  If an enrollee is not eligible for expedited external review, the
commissioner shall immediately notify the enrollee, the enrollee's appointed
representative, and the health carrier of the reasons for ineligibility.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If the commissioner determines that an
enrollee is eligible for expedited external review even though the enrollee has
not exhausted the health carrier's internal review process, the health carrier
shall not be required to proceed with its internal review process.  The health
carrier may elect to proceed with its internal review process even though the
request is determined by the commissioner to be eligible for expedited external
review; provided that the internal review process shall not delay or terminate
an expedited external review unless the health carrier decides to reverse its
adverse determination and provide coverage or payment for the health care
service that is the subject of the adverse determination.  Immediately after
making a decision to reverse its adverse determination, the health carrier
shall notify the enrollee, the enrollee's authorized representative, the
independent review organization assigned pursuant to subsection (e), and the
commissioner in writing of its decision.  The assigned independent review
organization shall terminate the expedited external review upon receipt of
notice from the health carrier pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Upon receipt of the notice pursuant to
subsection (b) or a determination of the commissioner pursuant to subsection (d)
that the enrollee meets the eligibility requirements for expedited external
review, the commissioner shall immediately randomly assign an independent
review organization to conduct the expedited external review from the list of
approved independent review organizations qualified to conduct the external
review, based on the nature of the health care service that is the subject of
the adverse action and other factors determined by the commissioner including
conflicts of interest pursuant to section 432E-43, compiled and maintained by
the commissioner to conduct the external review and immediately notify the
health carrier of the name of the assigned independent review organization.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Upon receipt of the notice from the
commissioner of the name of the independent review organization assigned to
conduct the expedited external review, the health carrier or its designee
utilization review organization shall provide or transmit all documents and information
it considered in making the adverse action that is the subject of the expedited
external review to the assigned independent review organization electronically
or by telephone, facsimile, or any other available expeditious method.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  In addition to the documents and
information provided or transmitted pursuant to subsection (f), the assigned
independent review organization shall consider the following in reaching a
decision:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The enrollee's pertinent medical records;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The attending health care professional's
recommendation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Consulting reports from appropriate health care
professionals and other documents submitted by the health carrier, enrollee,
the enrollee's appointed representative, or the enrollee's treating provider;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The application of medical necessity criteria as
defined in section 432E-1;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The most appropriate practice guidelines, which
shall include evidence-based standards, and may include any other practice
guidelines developed by the federal government, national or professional
medical societies, boards, and associations;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Any applicable clinical review criteria developed
and used by the health carrier or its designee utilization review organization
in making adverse determinations; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  The opinion of the independent review
organization's clinical reviewer or reviewers pertaining to the information
enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (5) to the extent the information and
documents are available and the clinical reviewer or reviewers consider
appropriate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In reaching a decision, the assigned
independent review organization shall not be bound by any decisions or
conclusions reached during the health carrier's utilization review or internal
appeals process; provided that the independent review organization's decision
shall not contradict the terms of the enrollee's health benefit plan or this
part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  As expeditiously as the enrollee's medical
condition or circumstances requires, but in no event more than seventy-two
hours after the date of receipt of the request for an expedited external review
that meets the reviewability requirements set forth in subsection (a), the
assigned independent review organization shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Make a decision to uphold or reverse the adverse
action; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Notify the enrollee, the enrollee's appointed
representative, the health carrier, and the commissioner of the decision.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If the notice provided pursuant to this
subsection was not in writing, within forty-eight hours after the date of
providing that notice, the assigned independent review organization shall
provide written confirmation of the decision to the enrollee, the enrollee's
appointed representative, the health carrier, and the commissioner that
includes the information provided in section 432E-37.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Upon receipt of the notice of a decision
reversing the adverse action, the health carrier shall immediately approve the
coverage that was the subject of the adverse action.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  An expedited external review shall not be
provided for retrospective adverse or final adverse determinations. [L 2011, c
230, pt of §2; am L 2012, c 34, §12]</p>
