the distressed property consultant; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The name and address of the distressed property
consultant to which notice of cancellation is to be delivered.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A distressed property consultant contract
shall be dated and signed by the distressed property consultant.  If the
distressed property consultant is a person other than an individual, the
individual executing the distressed property consultant contract on behalf of
the distressed property consultant shall identify the title and office held by

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A distressed property consultant contract
shall be dated and signed by all distressed property owners.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A distressed property consultant contract
shall disclose the following information, and shall be substantially in the
following form and printed in not less than fourteen-point type:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>          &quot;You may stop doing business with us at any
time.  You may accept or reject the offer of mortgage assistance we obtain from
your lender (or servicer).  If you reject the offer, you do not have to pay
us.  If you accept the offer, you will have to pay us [insert amount or method
of calculating the amount] for our services.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>          [Name of the company] is not associated with the
government, and our service is not approved by the government or your lender.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>          IF YOU STOP PAYING YOUR MORTGAGE, YOU COULD LOSE

<p class=RegularParagraphs>For the purposes of this subsection, the amount

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  For forms of mortgage assistance relief
that can only be obtained from a lending party, the objective of every such distressed

written offer to the distressed property owner for mortgage assistance relief
on terms acceptable to the property owners.  Any such agreement with the
lending party for mortgage assistance relief shall be in writing, and shall
become binding upon the distressed property owners only after all property
owners have accepted the offer by executing the written contract.[L 2008, c
137, pt of §2; am L 2016, c 142, §5]</p>
