<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where prosecution did not provide a sufficient foundation for
the admission of officer's testimony regarding the speed reading given by the
officer's laser gun, and no other evidence was admitted at trial indicating the
speed that defendant was driving defendant's motor vehicle, disregarding the
officer's testimony resulted in a record that was devoid of any evidence of the
speed that defendant was driving defendant's motor vehicle; as this material
element was not supported by substantial and admissible evidence, defendant's
conviction reversed.  121 H. 204, 216 P.3d 1227 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There was insufficient evidence in the record to sustain
defendant's conviction under this section for speeding excessively where, given
the relatively small margin of error of five miles per hour greater than the
threshold established, officer's testimony that officer's speedometer appeared
to have been operating normally throughout the previous year alone was
insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the speedometer on
officer's police vehicle was accurate to within five miles per hour on the
night of the offense.  122 H. 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the offense of driving at an excessive speed under
subsection (a) is not a strict liability offense and requires proof that the
defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, the requisite state of
mind must be charged in the offense; where the charge against defendant failed
to allege the requisite state of mind, judgment vacated and charge dismissed
without prejudice.  128 H. 314, 288 P.3d 788 (2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Charge of excessive speeding under subsection (a)(1) against
petitioner dismissed where the charge did not allege that petitioner acted
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, thus failing to allege the requisite
state of mind.   A charge that fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot
be construed reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge was dismissed
without prejudice because it violated due process.  130 H. 353, 311 P.3d 676 (2013).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As §291C-161(c) requires every person convicted under this
section to be sentenced in accordance with this section, trial court erred in
sentencing defendant to a six-month driver's license suspension under §286-125;
the plain language of this section required the sentencing court to impose the
list of sanctions as specific under subsection (c), including a thirty-day
license suspension for a first-time offender.  121 H. 117 (App.), 214 P.3d 1107
(2009).</p>
