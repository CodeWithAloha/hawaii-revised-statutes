provision of this chapter.  </span>C<span lang=X-NONE>laims that are filed with
the </span>department<span lang=X-NONE> shall be public records and subject to
the provisions of chapter 92F; provided that the department shall not make the

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (</span>b<span lang=X-NONE>) 
If a private college or university ceases operation, the </span>director<span

a student</span> or the parent or legal guardian of a student<span lang=X-NONE>
or the implementation of alternat</span>ive<span lang=X-NONE> enrollment for
the students enrolled in the institution, and the principal on the surety bond </span>filed
pursuant to section 305J-14(d) <span lang=X-NONE>shall pay the claim due in a
timely manner.  To the extent practicable, the </span>director<span

through a contract with another authorized private college or university, the
University of Hawaii system, an area vocational school, or any other
arrangement that is acceptable to the department.  The alternat</span>ive<span

enrollment agreement, if any, between the student and the private college or
university; provided that the student shall make tuition and fee payments as
required by the original enrollment agreement, if any.</span></p>

required to be offered pursuant to subsection (</span>b<span lang=X-NONE>) may
file a claim with the </span>department<span lang=X-NONE> for the student's
prorated share of the prepaid, unearned tuition and fees that the student paid,
subject to the limitations of subsection (</span>d<span lang=X-NONE>).  The </span>department<span
lang=X-NONE> shall not make a subsequent payment to a student</span>,<span

have been paid by students at the time </span>that <span lang=X-NONE>the
private college or university ceases operation, the department shall prorate
the amount of the surety bond among the students.</span></p>

The </span>director<span lang=X-NONE> shall determine whether offering alternat</span>ive<span

financial aid assistance.</span></p>

If a private college or university ceases to operate in the State, the </span>department
of the <span lang=X-NONE>attorney general may file a claim against the private

of the private college or university<span lang=X-NONE>.</span></p>
