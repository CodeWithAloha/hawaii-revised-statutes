<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Honolulu police department form 396B prohibiting operation of
&quot;a vehicle&quot; in the event of license revocation did adequately put
defendant on notice that the term &quot;vehicle&quot; includes mopeds and
vessels, as the term &quot;vehicle&quot; is a term of ordinary usage and broad
enough to inform a person of ordinary intelligence that it would include a
means of ground transportation such as a moped.  108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although the oral charge tracked the language of §291E-61,
where the charge failed to allege that defendant was driving defendant's
vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense,
the charge was deficient, as the term &quot;operate&quot; as defined in this
section did not comport with its commonly understood definition, required the
conduct to take place &quot;upon a public way, street, road, or highway&quot;,
and was neither &quot;unmistakable&quot; nor &quot;readily comprehensible to
persons of common understanding&quot;.  121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section establishes an attendant circumstance of the
offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII),
i.e., that the defendant's conduct occur &quot;upon a public way, street, road,
or highway&quot;; the definition of &quot;operate&quot; in this section refers
generally to the conduct of &quot;operating&quot; a vehicle under the influence
as described in the title of §291E-61, whether the conduct consists of driving
the vehicle or otherwise assuming actual physical control of it; thus, the
operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway is an
attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII and therefore an element of the
offense.  121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).</p>
