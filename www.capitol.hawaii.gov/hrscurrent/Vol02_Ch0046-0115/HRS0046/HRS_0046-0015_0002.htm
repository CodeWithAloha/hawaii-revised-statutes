granted under this section or section 46-15.1, to establish one or more loan
programs and to issue bonds under chapter 47 or 49 to provide moneys to carry
out the purposes of this section or section 46-15.1; provided that:</p>

47 to finance one or more loan programs, the county may establish qualifications
for the program or programs as it deems appropriate;</p>

without the State to serve as trustee for the holders of bonds issued to
provide moneys to carry out the purposes of this section or section 46-15.1,

out the purposes of this section or section 46-15.1, or the revenues and receipts

provided in subparagraph (I), the director of finance of the county may hold
the proceeds or revenues and receipts in a separate account in the treasury of
the county, to be applied solely to the carrying out of the ordinance, trust
indenture, trust agreement, or indenture of mortgage, if any, authorizing or
securing the bonds; and</p>
