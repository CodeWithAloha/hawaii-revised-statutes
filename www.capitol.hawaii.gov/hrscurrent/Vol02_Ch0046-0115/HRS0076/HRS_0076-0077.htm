<p class=XNotesHeading>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Provisions of civil service laws construed in light of Konno
v. County of Hawaii decision for purposes of privatization.  Att. Gen. Op.
97-6.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Provisions of the Maui Charter in conflict with this section
are invalid.  59 H. 65, 576 P.2d 1029.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Civil service, as defined by this section, encompasses those
services that have been customarily and historically provided by civil
servants.  85 H. 61, 937 P.2d 397.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Landfill worker positions were within civil service where
position not specifically exempted by another statute as provided by paragraph
(10) and §46-85 mentions nothing about civil service nor does it include a
specific exemption.  85 H. 61, 937 P.2d 397.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where, under this section, landfill worker positions were
within civil service, and thus governed by merit principles under article XVI,
§1 of Hawaii constitution, county violated Hawaii constitution and civil
service statutes when it privatized new landfill operation.  85 H. 61, 937 P.2d
397.</p>
