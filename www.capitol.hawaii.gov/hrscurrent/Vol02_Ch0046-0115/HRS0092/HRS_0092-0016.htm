<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§92-16]  Power of boards to issue
subpoenas, administer oaths, appoint masters, etc.</b>  (a)  Any board (which
term as used in this section means any board or commission of the State or of
any political subdivision of the State) which is by law authorized or required
to hold hearings for the purpose of receiving evidence, shall have the
following powers, in addition to those provided for by any other law, in
connection with the hearings:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To subpoena witnesses upon subpoena signed by the
chairperson, acting chairperson, or any member, or executive secretary, or
executive officer of or under the board who is so authorized by the board.  The
subpoenas shall be served in the same manner, and the witnesses subpoenaed
shall be entitled to the same witness fees, as in the case of a witness
subpoenaed to testify before a circuit court.  Any circuit court, upon the
written application of any member of the board or of any master appointed by it
as in this section provided, shall have power to enforce obedience to the
subpoena by contempt proceedings.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Through the chairperson, acting chairperson, or
any member of the board, or through the executive secretary or executive
officer of or under the board so authorized by the board, to administer oaths
to witnesses and require the testimony of such witnesses on matters germane to
the subject under inquiry at the hearing.  Any party to the hearing upon
request shall be allowed to be represented by counsel and be allowed reasonable
rights of examination and cross-examination of witnesses.  Any false swearing
by a witness at the hearing upon any material issue or matter shall constitute
perjury, and be punishable as such.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  To appoint, by written resolution adopted by vote
of a majority of the board, a master or masters (who may, but need not be, a
member or members of the board, or a disinterested attorney at law or other
person, or a combination of any of them) to hold the hearing and take testimony
upon the matters involved in the hearing and report to the board the master's
or their findings and recommendations, together with a transcript of the
hearing or a summary of the evidence and testimony taken thereat, and to adopt
the findings and recommendations, in whole or in part, or otherwise act upon
the report and transcript or summary, and, in the board's discretion, to hold
further hearings and take further evidence and testimony in connection
therewith, before taking final action thereon.  Any master may be paid such
reasonable compensation as shall be determined by the board, provided that no
member of the board shall be eligible to receive any additional compensation
for services as master.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Subpoena fees, master's fees, and other
expenses in connection with the hearings shall be payable out of any moneys
appropriated or available for expenditure by the board for personal services or
current expenses, or both.  Any master so appointed shall have all of the
powers which would be held and enjoyed by the board or the chairperson or any
member thereof in connection with the hearing. [L 1949, c 329, §1; RL 1955,
§7-27; HRS §92-12; am L 1973, c 31, pt of §21; ren §92-16; gen ch 1985, 1993]</p>
