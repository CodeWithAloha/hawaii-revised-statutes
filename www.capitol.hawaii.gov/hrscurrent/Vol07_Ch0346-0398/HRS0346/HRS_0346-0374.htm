<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§</b><b>346</b><b>-374]  Homeless shelter
stipends.</b>  <i>[Section effective until June 30, 2017.  For section
effective July 1, 2017, see below.]</i>  (a)  The stipend limits per shelter
unit of zero bedrooms shall be adjusted by the department annually on the first
day of July pursuant to standards established by rule, which may consider
changes in the cost of operating homeless facilities, the fair market rents,
the consumer price index, or other relevant factors.  A &quot;shelter unit of
zero bedrooms&quot; means a living unit that is a studio unit or a single-room
occupancy unit.  The homeless shelter stipend at transitional shelters for
larger shelter units shall be proportional to the difference in unit size.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The department may make or may contract to
make homeless shelter stipend payments on behalf of one or more homeless
families or individuals to a provider agency operating or managing an emergency
or transitional shelter or, if the department itself operates and manages a
homeless facility, to the department in amounts and under circumstances as
provided by rule.  The contract may specify a minimum total amount of homeless
shelter stipends to be received by a provider agency for making its shelter and
services available to eligible homeless families or individuals.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  In making homeless shelter stipend
payments to a provider agency, the department may establish minimum services to
be provided by the provider agency to homeless families or individuals at the provider
agency's shelter.  The department may also direct provider agencies to
establish and manage a savings account program as described in subsection (d).  Additionally,
the department may direct provider agencies to subcontract for outreach
services from other private agencies specializing in programs for the unsheltered
homeless.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Provider agencies and the department may
establish and collect shelter and services payments from homeless families or
individuals in addition to the amount received in homeless shelter stipend
payments pursuant to rule.  Provider agencies and the department may also set
aside a portion of the payments in a savings account to be made available to
homeless families or individuals when these families and individuals vacate the
shelter. [L 2010, c 89, pt of §2]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§346</b><b>-374  Homeless shelter stipends.</b> 
<i>[Section effective July 1, 2017.  For section effective until June 30, 2017,
see above.]</i>  (a)  The department may make or may contract to make homeless
shelter stipend payments to a provider agency operating or managing an
emergency or transitional shelter.  Under each contract, the department shall
pay homeless shelter stipends only for performance measures actually achieved
by the provider agency, such as the number of homeless families or individuals
actually provided with shelter and appropriate services at the emergency or
transitional shelter.  The contract also may include provisions for the
automatic adjustment of the homeless shelter stipend amounts, depending on
factors agreed to by the department and provider agency.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  In making homeless shelter stipend
payments to a provider agency, the department may establish minimum services to
be provided by the provider agency to homeless families or individuals at the
provider agency's shelter.  The department may also direct provider agencies to
establish and manage a savings account program as described in subsection (c). 
Additionally, the department may direct provider agencies to subcontract for
outreach services from other private agencies specializing in programs for the
unsheltered homeless.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  When authorized under a contract with the
department, a provider agency may establish and collect shelter and services
payments from homeless families or individuals in addition to the amount
received in homeless shelter stipend payments.  To the extent possible, the
shelter and service payment amounts established and collected by a homeless
facility, other than an emergency shelter, shall be based on the homeless
families' and individuals' ability to pay.  If collection of payments based on
ability to pay is too difficult, costly, or inefficient for the provider
agency, the payment amounts may be based on other criteria authorized under the
contract or waived partially or entirely.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Provider agencies and the department may also
set aside a portion of the payments in a savings account to be made available
to homeless families or individuals when these families and individuals vacate
the shelter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Any state funding assistance provided to a
provider agency for compliance with the minimum requirements under section
346-374.5(b) shall be in addition to homeless shelter stipends paid to the
provider agency. [L 2010, c 89, pt of §2; am L 2016, c 234, §5]</p>
