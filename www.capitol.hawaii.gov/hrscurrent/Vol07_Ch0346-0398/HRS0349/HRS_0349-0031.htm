has a substantial developmental delay or specific congenital or acquired
condition, may be considered to have a developmental disability without meeting

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Within the individual, limitations often coexist

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  An important purpose of describing limitations is
to develop a profile of needed supports; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  With appropriate personalized supports over a
sustained period, the life functioning of the person with intellectual
disability generally will improve.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Long-term supports and services&quot;

impairs an individual for an indefinite period of time. [L 2012, c 237, pt of
