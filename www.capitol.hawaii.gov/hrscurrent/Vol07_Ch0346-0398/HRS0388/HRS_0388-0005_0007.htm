<p class=ASubparagraph>          (C)  The means to access the balance or other

inactive for a period of not less than twelve months or the employee is no
longer employed by the employer;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  Pooled pay card accounts shall be permitted;
provided that each subaccount shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of

account on or before the employee's designated payday.  The employee shall be
deemed to have been paid wages owed at the time the wages are deposited into
the employee's pay card account and the employee has access to those wages.  If
there is any delay of an employee's access to wages due to an error by the
issuer, the employer shall not be held liable for this delay; provided that the
employer deposited the proper amount of wages into the account on or before the
designated payday and the employer is in compliance with subsection (a).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  An employer shall be liable for any wages
