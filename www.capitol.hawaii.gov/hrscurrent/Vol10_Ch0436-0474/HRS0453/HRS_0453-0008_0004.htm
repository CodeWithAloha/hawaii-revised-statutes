an immediate and unreasonable threat to personal safety or of fraud that
jeopardizes or endangers the health or safety of patients as determined by the
professional standards of care upon consumers, and that, for the protection of
the public from the possible consequences of such practices, the license should
be immediately suspended or restricted.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  <span class=documentbody1><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>The order of summary suspension shall include

shall be effective upon service.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A licensee served with an order of summary
suspension shall have the right to request a hearing to show cause why the

shall be made in writing and filed with the board within five business days of
service of the order.  The board shall hold a hearing within seven business
days of receipt of the licensee's request for the hearing to show cause.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary,
an order summarily suspending a license issued under this chapter shall remain
in effect until the effective date of a final decision and order issued by the
board in a disciplinary action or the effective date of an order issued by the
board terminating the summary suspension following a hearing to show cause,
whichever occurs first, but in either case shall not exceed thirty business

license and shall subject the licensee to any penalties prescribed under this
chapter, the applicable licensing laws, or any rule or order of the board. [L
