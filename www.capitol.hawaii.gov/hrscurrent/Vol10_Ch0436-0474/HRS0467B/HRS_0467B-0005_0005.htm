using the name of a charitable organization, the commercial co&#8209;venturer
shall obtain the written consent of the charitable organization whose name will
be used during the charitable sales promotion.  The commercial co-venturer

days prior to the commencement of the charitable sales promotion within this
State.  An authorized representative of the charitable organization and the commercial

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A late filing fee of $20 shall be imposed

chapter, the attorney general may impose an administrative fine not to exceed
$1,000 for each act that constitutes a violation of this chapter and an
additional penalty, not to exceed $100 per day, for each day during which the
violation continues.  Any person aggrieved by an action of the attorney general
under this section may request a hearing to review that action in accordance
with chapter 91 and rules adopted by the attorney general.  Any request for
hearing shall be made within ten days after the attorney general has served the
person with notice of the action, which notice shall be deemed effective upon
mailing. [L 1993, c 206, pt of §1; am L 2004, c 93, §6; am L 2008, c 174, §5;
