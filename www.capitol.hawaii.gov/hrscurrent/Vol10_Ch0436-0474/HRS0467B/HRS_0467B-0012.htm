<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§467B-12  Filing requirements for
professional fundraising counsel and professional solicitors</b>.  (a)  Every
professional fundraising counsel or professional solicitor, prior to any
solicitation, shall register with the department.  The registration statement
shall contain the information set forth in subsection (e).  The registration
statement shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount of $250, or in the amount
and with any additional sums as may be prescribed by the attorney general. 
Renewal registration statements shall be filed with the department on or before
July 1 of each calendar year by each professional fundraising counsel or
professional solicitor.  The renewal statement shall contain the information
set forth in subsection (e).  A renewal fee of $250, or in any amount and with
any additional sums as may be prescribed by the attorney general, shall
accompany the renewal statement.  If a renewal registration required under this
section is not filed, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable
cause, a fine of $20 shall be imposed for each day during which the violation
continues; provided that the total amount imposed under this subsection shall
not exceed $1,000.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Each professional solicitor, at the time

$25,000 issued with good and sufficient surety or sureties approved by the
attorney general and which shall remain in effect for one year.  The bond shall
inure to the benefit of the State, conditioned that the applicant, its
officers, directors, employees, agents, servants, and independent contractors
shall not violate this chapter.  A partnership or corporation that is a
professional solicitor may file a consolidated bond on behalf of all its
members, officers, and employees.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The attorney general shall examine each
registration statement and supporting document filed by a professional

that the registration requirements are not satisfied, the attorney general
shall notify the professional fundraising counsel or professional solicitor in
writing within fifteen business days of its receipt of the registration
statement; otherwise the registration statement is deemed to be approved. 
Within seven business days after receipt of a notification that the
registration requirements are not satisfied, the professional fundraising
counsel or professional solicitor may request a hearing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The attorney general may require that
registration and renewal registration, surety bonds, and contracts be filed
with the department electronically and may require the use of electronic

administrative action by, another governmental agency;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  A statement whether any officer, director, or any
