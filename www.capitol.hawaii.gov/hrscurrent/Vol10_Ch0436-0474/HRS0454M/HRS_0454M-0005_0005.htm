<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     [§454M-5.5]&nbsp;&nbsp;Residential mortgage
loan delinquencies and loss mitigation efforts.</b>  (a)  Mortgage servicers
shall make reasonable and good faith efforts consistent with this chapter to
engage in appropriate loss mitigation options, including loan modifications, to
assist borrowers to avoid foreclosure.  Mortgage servicers shall provide timely
and appropriate responses to borrower inquiries and complaints regarding
available loss mitigation options and ensure that borrowers are not required to
submit multiple copies of required documents during consideration for any loss
mitigation option.  In the event of a delinquency or other act of default on
the part of the borrower, or whenever a borrower who is at imminent risk of
default contacts the mortgage servicer with respect to a loan modification or
other loss mitigation option, the mortgage servicer shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Inform the borrower of the facts concerning the
loan, the nature and extent of the delinquency or default, the mortgage
servicer's loss mitigation option protocols, and the loss mitigation options
and services offered by the mortgage servicer in accordance with this chapter;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Pursue loss mitigation options with the borrower,
including a loan modification whenever possible, in accordance with this chapter,
and, if the borrower replies, negotiate with the borrower, subject to the
mortgage servicer's lawful duties and obligations under the mortgage servicing
contract, if any, to attempt a resolution or workout of the delinquency or to
prevent the borrower's default.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Mortgage servicers shall consider a loan
modification as an alternative to foreclosure when:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The borrower demonstrates that the borrower has
experienced a financial hardship and is either unable to maintain the payment
at the current amount required under the mortgage loan or is unable to make up
the delinquent payments; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The net present value of the income stream
expected of the modified loan is greater than the net present value of the
income stream that is expected to be recovered through the disposition of the
property through a foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Mortgage servicers that are participating
in the Home Affordable Modification Program shall offer loan modifications in
compliance with the Home Affordable Modification Program guidance and
directives, including using reasonable efforts to remove prohibitions or
impediments to the mortgage servicer's authority, and obtain third party
consents and waivers that are required by contract or law to effectuate a loan
modification under the Home Affordable Modification Program.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Unless a longer time is permitted under
the guidance or directives implementing the Home Affordable Modification
Program, within ten business days of receiving a request from a borrower or the
borrower's authorized representative for one or more loss mitigation options,
the mortgage servicer shall transmit a written acknowledgment of the request to
the borrower and, if applicable, to the authorized representative.  The
acknowledgment shall identify with specificity any information needed from the
borrower for the mortgage servicer to review the borrower's loss mitigation
option request.  The acknowledgment shall also include an explanation of the
loss mitigation option process, including the following, as appropriate:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The information that the borrower may be asked to
provide and third party approvals that may be required for the mortgage
servicer to evaluate and complete the request for a loan modification or other
loss mitigation option;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The average length of time for a decision to be
made regarding a loan modification or other loss mitigation option; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A notification of the actions the mortgage
servicer, lender, or owner of the mortgage may take during the loss mitigation
option process, such as whether the borrower may continue to receive collection
letters or foreclosure notices, whether the foreclosure process will continue,
or whether and to what extent collection and foreclosure will be stayed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Within thirty days of receiving all
required documentation from the borrower and third parties, unless a shorter
time is required under applicable state or federal rules or regulations
pertaining to mortgage servicing or under guidance or directives implementing
the Home Affordable Modification Program, a mortgage servicer shall complete
its evaluation of the borrower's eligibility for a loan modification or any
other loss mitigation option requested by the borrower and advise the borrower,
and if applicable, the borrower's authorized representative, in writing of the
mortgage servicer's determination.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If the mortgage servicer approves the borrower
for a loan modification, including a trial loan modification, or other loss
mitigation option, the written notice shall provide the borrower with clear and
understandable written information explaining the material terms, costs, and
risks of the loss mitigation option offered.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If the mortgage servicer determines that the
borrower cannot be approved for a loan modification or other requested loss
mitigation option, the written notice shall state with specificity:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The reasons for the determination;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Procedures, deadlines, and contact information
for a person at the mortgage servicer for reconsideration, dispute, or appeal
of the determination; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any other loss mitigation option for which the
borrower may be considered.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>In addition, the written notice shall include the
following statement, in boldface type and in print no smaller than the largest
print used elsewhere in the main body of the written notice:  &quot;If you
believe your loss mitigation option request has been wrongly denied, you may
file a complaint with the state division of financial institutions at [insert
current division telephone number] or [insert current division website address
for consumer complaints]&quot;.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  A mortgage servicer shall take reasonable
steps to ensure that the mortgage servicer's staff is aware of programs
designed to assist borrowers to avoid foreclosure or resolve delinquency.  The
mortgage servicer shall make available to borrowers who are at least sixty days
delinquent or who the mortgage servicer has reason to believe are experiencing
a financial hardship and are in imminent risk of default, a list of government
approved not-for-profit housing counselors in the borrower's geographic area,
as listed on the website of the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  A mortgage servicer shall maintain and
make available to borrowers and borrowers' authorized representatives current contact
information to communicate and negotiate with the mortgage servicer's
designated loss mitigation option staff who are authorized to discuss and
negotiate loss mitigation options.  The contact information shall include all
toll-free telephone numbers for direct communication with a loss mitigation
option staff person, fax numbers for receipt of documents, and electronic mail
addresses.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The mortgage servicer shall establish and
maintain a process through which borrowers may bring disagreements to a
supervisory level where a separate review of the borrower's eligibility or
qualification for a loss mitigation option can be performed.  A mortgage
servicer shall not require a borrower to waive legal claims and defenses as a
condition of a loan modification, forbearance, or repayment plan.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  Delay caused by the mortgage servicer
shall not be counted in calculating the passage of time where a Home Affordable
Modification Program, proprietary, or other loan modification program
specifies:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A time limit for a borrower action or response,
including appealing or disputing a denial of a request for a loss mitigation
option under subsection (e), or providing documents;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A time after which a document is considered stale
or too old to use; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A time during which a mortgage servicer is barred
from taking certain action adverse to the borrower, including taking steps
toward foreclosure or referring the borrower's account to foreclosure.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>Examples of delay caused by the mortgage servicer
include the mortgage servicer's failure to timely send a communication or
request to the borrower, duplicative or piecemeal document requests delaying
completion of a file, and failure to identify additional documents needed to
complete a borrower's loan modification application.  The mortgage servicer
shall reasonably extend the applicable period and promptly inform the borrower
in writing of the specific extension period.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  Nothing in this section shall be construed
to prevent a mortgage servicer from offering or accepting alternative loss
mitigation options, including other modification programs offered by the
mortgage servicer, a short sale, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or forbearance,
if the borrower requests such an alternative, is not eligible for or does not
qualify for a loan modification under the Home Affordable Modification Program,
or rejects the mortgage servicer's loss mitigation option proposal.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  A mortgage servicer shall avoid taking
steps to foreclose or to refer a borrower to foreclosure if the borrower has
requested and is being considered for a loss mitigation option or if the
borrower is in a trial or permanent loan modification and is not more than
thirty days in default under the loan modification agreement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (l)  A mortgage servicer shall ensure that the
mortgage servicer and the mortgage servicer's attorneys and agents comply with
the requirements of chapter 667.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (m)  A mortgage servicer shall establish and
maintain a system for servicing delinquent loans. [L 2015, c 62, §1]</p>
