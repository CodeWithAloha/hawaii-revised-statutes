<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A collection agency that is designated as

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  Violate any of the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  A collection agency shall not collect or

first registering under this chapter, or being designated as an exempt
out-of-state collection agency pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  A designated exempt out-of-state
collection agency shall notify the director in writing of any judgment, award,
disciplinary action, consent decree, or order issued against it in any
jurisdiction within thirty days of the entry of the judgment, award,

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  The failure of a designated exempt
out-of-state collection agency to maintain a current, unrestricted, and

identified in its application shall cause the automatic forfeiture of the
exemption effective as of the date on which the designated exempt out-of-state
collection agency's license, permit, or registration is no longer current,
unrestricted, or unconditional in the reciprocal state identified in its
application.  Any collection activity by the designated exempt out-of-state
collection agency after the forfeiture date shall be deemed to be unlicensed
activity.  An out-of-state collection agency whose exemption is forfeited shall
apply as a new applicant for an exemption in order to resume business in the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  The remedies or penalties provided by this
section are cumulative to the remedies or penalties available under this
chapter and all other laws of the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  Any collection activity by a designated
exempt out-of-state collection agency, other than activity authorized by this
section, shall be deemed to be unlicensed activity.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (l)  The director may deny or refuse to renew
an out-of-state collection agency's initial or renewal application for
exemption for failure to comply with this section, or for the grounds set forth
in sections 443B-4.57 or 436B-19.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (m)  In order to effectuate this section and
enforce the requirements of this chapter as it relates to designated exempt
out-of-state collection agencies, the director is expressly authorized to
initiate any action on behalf of the State as may be appropriate in any state
or federal court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (n)  For purposes of this section, a
&quot;reciprocal state&quot; is one:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Whose requirements to be licensed, permitted, or
registered as a collection agency in that state are at a minimum substantially
equivalent to the requirements to be registered as a collection agency in this
State, including but not limited to the bonding requirements in section 443B-5;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  That does not require a Hawaii collection agency
to obtain a license, permit, or registration to collect debts in that state if
the activities of the Hawaii collection agency are limited to collecting debts
on behalf of an out-of-state creditor using interstate communication methods,
including telephone, facsimile, mail, or electronic mail, and the Hawaii
collection agency does not solicit or engage in collection activities for
clients in that state. [L 2000, c 135, §1; am L 2012, c 52, §1]</p>
