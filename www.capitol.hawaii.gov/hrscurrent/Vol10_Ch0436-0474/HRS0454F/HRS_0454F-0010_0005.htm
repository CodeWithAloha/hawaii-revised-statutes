<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A mortgage loan originator company shall
not maintain any branch offices in the State in addition to its principal place
of business without the prior written approval of the commissioner.  An
application to establish a branch office shall be submitted <span
style='color:black'>through NMLS </span>with a nonrefundable application fee as
required by section 454F-22.  A mortgage loan originator company shall
designate a branch manager for each branch office <span style='color:black'>who
is physically present in</span> the branch office to oversee that branch office
and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of a branch manager set forth in
section 454F-1.7.  <span style='color:black'>At no time shall a branch manager
oversee more than one branch office or principal place of business.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A mortgage loan originator company shall
not relocate any office in this State without the prior written approval of the
commissioner.  An application to relocate an office shall <span
style='color:black'>be submitted to the commissioner at least thirty days prior
to relocating and shall </span>set forth the reasons for the relocation, the
street address of the proposed relocated office, and other information that may
be required by the commissioner.  An application to relocate an office pursuant
to this subsection shall be submitted with a nonrefundable fee as required by
section 454F-22.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A mortgage loan originator company shall
give the commissioner notice of its intent to close a branch office at least
thirty days prior to the closing.  The notice shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  State the intended date of closing; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Specify the reasons for the closing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A mortgage loan originator company that
maintains its principal office outside of the State shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Designate an office in this State as its
principal place of business in this State;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Apply for and obtain approval from the
commissioner to designate its principal place of business in this State as a

<p class=1Paragraph>     <span style='font-family:"CG Times",serif'>(</span>3)  Designate

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The principal place of business and each
branch office of the mortgage loan originator company shall be identified in
NMLS to consumers as a location at which the licensee holds itself out as a
mortgage loan originator company.  Each such location shall be open for
business to the public during posted business hours, at least some of which shall
be during regular business hours.  If a location is in a commercial building,
then the business hours shall be posted on or adjacent to the main office door
of the mortgage loan originator company's location, and visible to the public
from outside the location.  If a location is not in a commercial building, or
such posting is not permitted by the commercial building, then the business
hours shall be posted on the home page of the mortgage loan originator
company's website, along with the address and phone number of the location. 
Business hours, whether posted at a location or on a mortgage loan originator
company website, shall be displayed in a clear, conspicuous, and accurate
manner that informs the consumer when the location will be open.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The commissioner or the commissioner's
authorized representatives shall be able to conduct an examination or
investigation during regular business hours.  If the commissioner or the
commissioner's authorized representatives are denied access to any office,
record, or file for any reason, such denial may be considered a violation of
this chapter. [L 2010, c 84, pt of §3; am L 2011, c 194, §10; am L 2013, c 168,
