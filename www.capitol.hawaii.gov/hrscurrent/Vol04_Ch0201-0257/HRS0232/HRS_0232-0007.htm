<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §232-7  Boards of review; duties, powers,
procedure before.</b>  (a)  The board of review for each district shall hear
informally all disputes between the assessor and any taxpayer in all cases in
which appeals have been duly taken and the fact that a notice of appeal has
been duly filed by a taxpayer shall be conclusive evidence of the existence of
a dispute; provided that this provision shall not be construed to permit a
taxpayer to dispute an assessment to the extent that it is in accordance with
the taxpayer's return.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Each board shall hold public meetings at
some central location in its taxation district <span style='color:black'>at
least once annually </span>and shall hear, as speedily as possible, all appeals
presented for each year.  A taxpayer's identity and final documents submitted
in support or opposition of an appeal shall be public information; provided
that an individual taxpayer is authorized to redact all but the last four
digits of the taxpayer's social security number from any accompanying tax
return.  Each board shall have the power and authority to decide all questions
of fact and all questions of law, excepting questions involving the
Constitution or laws of the United States, necessary to the determination of
the objections raised by the taxpayer in the notice of appeal; provided that no
board shall have power to determine or declare an assessment illegal or void. 
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, each board shall have
power to allow or disallow exemptions pursuant to law whether or not previously
allowed or disallowed by the assessor and to increase or lower any assessment.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The board shall base its decision on the
evidence before it, and, as provided in section 231-20, the assessment made by
the assessor shall be deemed prima facie correct.  The board shall file with
the assessor concerned its decision in writing on each appeal decided by it,
and a certified copy of the decision shall be furnished by the assessor to the
taxpayer concerned by delivery or by mailing the copy addressed to the taxpayer's
last known place of residence.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Each board and each member thereof in
addition to all other powers shall also have the power to subpoena witnesses,
administer oaths, examine books and records, and hear and take evidence in
relation to any subject pending before the board.  The tax appeal court shall
have the power, upon request of the boards, to enforce by proper proceedings
the attendance of witnesses and the giving of testimony by them, and the
production of books, records, and papers at the hearings of the boards.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  If there exists more than one board of
review in a taxation district, the chair of one board, administratively and
without requirement of any formal action, may assign a member of that board to
serve as a temporary member of the requesting board for purposes of
establishing a quorum at a designated meeting of the requesting board.  The
temporary member shall serve only for the specific board meeting for which the
assignment is made and only for the period necessary to establish and maintain
a quorum.  A temporary member may participate in discussion and vote on all
matters before the board.  Nothing herein shall prevent a member from being
assigned multiple times under this subsection. [L 1932 2d, c 40, §40; RL 1935,
