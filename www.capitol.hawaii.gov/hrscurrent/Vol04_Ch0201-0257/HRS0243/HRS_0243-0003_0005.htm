of petroleum product that is not aviation fuel; provided that of the tax

imposed by subsection (a) or (b), on or before the last day of each calendar
month, shall file with the director, on forms prescribed, prepared, and

and preserve for five years a record in a form as the department of taxation
shall prescribe showing the total number of barrels, and the fractional part of
barrels, of petroleum product or the total number of one million British
thermal units of fossil fuel, as the case may be, sold by the distributor

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Barrel&quot; may be converted to million
British thermal units, using the United States Department of Energy, Energy
Information Administration annual energy review or annual energy outlook.</p>
