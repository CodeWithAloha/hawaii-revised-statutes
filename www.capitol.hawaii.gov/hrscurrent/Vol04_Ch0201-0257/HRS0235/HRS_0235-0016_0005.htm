the tax imposed under this chapter, a cesspool upgrade, conversion, or
connection income tax credit that shall be deductible from the taxpayer's net
income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in
which the credit is properly claimed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  In the case of a partnership, S
corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for qualified
expenses incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The expenses upon which
the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level. 
Distribution and share of credit shall be determined by rule.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The cesspool upgrade, conversion, or
connection income tax credit shall be equal to the qualified expenses of the
taxpayer, up to a maximum of $10,000; provided that, in the case of a qualified
cesspool that is a residential large capacity cesspool, the amount of the
credit shall be equal to the qualified expenses of the taxpayer, up to a
maximum of $10,000 per residential dwelling connected to the cesspool, as
certified by the department of health pursuant to subsection (e).  There shall be
allowed a maximum of one cesspool upgrade, conversion, or connection income tax
credit per qualified cesspool or per tax map key number where more than one
residence is connected to a residential large-capacity cesspool.  The cesspool
upgrade, conversion, or connection income tax credit shall be available only
for the taxable year in which the taxpayer's qualified expenses are certified
by the appropriate government agency.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The total amount of tax credits allowed
under this section shall not exceed $5,000,000 for all taxpayers in any taxable
year; provided that any taxpayer who is not eligible to claim the credit in a
taxable year due to the $5,000,000 cap having been exceeded for that taxable
year shall be eligible to claim the credit in the subsequent taxable year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The department of health shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Certify all qualified cesspools for the purposes

in its discretion, may certify no more than two residential large capacity

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Collect and maintain a record of all qualified
expenses certified by an appropriate government agency for the taxable year;
and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Certify to each taxpayer the amount of credit the
taxpayer may claim; provided that if, in any year, the annual amount of certified
credits reaches $5,000,000 in the aggregate, the department of health shall
immediately discontinue certifying credits and notify the department of
taxation.</p>

information to ascertain the validity of the claim for the tax credit made
under this section; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  May adopt rules under chapter 91 necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>    (g)  If the tax credit under this section
exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of the credit over
liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax liability
in subsequent years until exhausted.  All claims for the tax credit under this
section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the
twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may
be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a
waiver of the right to claim the credit.</p>

years beginning after December 31, 2020.</p>
