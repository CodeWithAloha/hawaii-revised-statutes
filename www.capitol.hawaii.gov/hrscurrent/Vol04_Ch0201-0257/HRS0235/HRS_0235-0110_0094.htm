258, §5.] </i> (a)  There shall be allowed to each qualified taxpayer subject
to the tax imposed under this chapter, an income tax credit that shall be
deductible from the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by
this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The amount of the tax credit shall be
equal to the qualified expenses of the qualified taxpayer, up to a maximum of
$50,000.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  In the case of a partnership, S
corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for qualified
expenses incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The expenses upon which
the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level. 
Distribution and share of credit shall be determined by rule.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The total amount of tax credits allowed
under this section shall not exceed $2,000,000 for all qualified taxpayers in
any taxable year; provided that any taxpayer who is not eligible to claim the
credit in a taxable year due to the $2,000,000&nbsp;cap having been exceeded
for that taxable year shall be eligible to claim the credit in the subsequent
taxable year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Every qualified taxpayer, before March 31
of each year in which qualified expenses were incurred by the taxpayer in the
previous taxable year, shall submit a written, certified statement to the
chairperson of the board of agriculture identifying:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Qualified expenses incurred in the previous
taxable year; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The amount of the tax credit claimed by the

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Upon each determination made under this
subsection, the department of agriculture shall issue a certificate to the
taxpayer verifying information submitted to the department of agriculture,
including amounts of qualified expenses, the credit amount certified for the
taxpayer for each taxable year, and the cumulative amount of tax credits
certified.  The taxpayer shall file the certificate with the taxpayer's tax

information to ascertain the validity of the claim for the tax credit made
under this section; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  May adopt rules under chapter 91 necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  If the tax credit under this section

liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's net income tax liability
in subsequent years until exhausted.  All claims for the tax credit under this
section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the
twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may
be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a
waiver of the right to claim the credit.</p>

income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this chapter.</p>
