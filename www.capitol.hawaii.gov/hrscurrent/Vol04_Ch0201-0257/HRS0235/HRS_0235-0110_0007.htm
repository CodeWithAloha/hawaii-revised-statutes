(a)  There shall be allowed to each taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter a capital goods excise tax credit which shall be deductible from the
taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the
taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The amount of the tax credit shall be
determined by the application of the following rates against the cost of the
eligible depreciable tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in a trade
or business and placed in service within Hawaii after December 31, 1987.  For
calendar years beginning after:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  December 31, 1987, the applicable rate shall be
three per cent;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  December 31, 1988, the applicable rate shall be
four per cent;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  December 31, 2008, the applicable rate shall be
zero per cent; and</p>

applicable rate shall be the rate for the calendar year in which the eligible
depreciable tangible personal property used in the trade or business is placed
in service within Hawaii.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In the case of a partnership, S corporation,
estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for eligible depreciable tangible
personal property which is placed in service by the entity.  The cost upon
which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level. 
Distribution and share of credit shall be determined by rules.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In the case of eligible depreciable tangible
personal property for which a credit for sales or use taxes paid to another
state is allowable under section 238-3(i), the amount of the tax credit allowed
under this section shall not exceed the amount of use tax actually paid under
chapter 238 relating to such tangible personal property.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If a deduction is taken under section 179 (with
respect to election to expense certain depreciable business assets) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, no tax credit shall be allowed for
that portion of the cost of property for which the deduction was taken.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If the capital goods excise tax credit
allowed under subsection (a) exceeds the taxpayer's net income tax liability,
the excess of credit over liability shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided
that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credit allowed by this section
shall be made for amounts less than $1.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     All claims for tax credits under this section,
including any amended claims, must be filed on or before the end of the twelfth
month following the close of the taxable year for which the credits may be
claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a
