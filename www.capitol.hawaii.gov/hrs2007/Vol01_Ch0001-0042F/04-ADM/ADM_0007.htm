Such elections shall be held, and the qualifications of voters thereat shall

shall be made and certified in such manner as the constitution of the proposed
State of Hawaii may prescribe.  The Governor of Hawaii shall certify the
results of said elections, as so ascertained, to the President of the United
States.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  At an election designated by proclamation
of the Governor of Hawaii, which may be either the primary or the general

general election, or a special election, there shall be submitted to the
electors qualified to vote in said election, for adoption or rejection, the
following propositions:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    &quot;(1)  Shall Hawaii immediately be admitted into
the Union as a State?</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    &quot;(2)  The boundaries of the State of Hawaii shall
be as prescribed in the Act of Congress approved </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>                                (Date of approval of

land or sea outside the boundaries so prescribed are hereby irrevocably
relinquished to the United States.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    &quot;(3)  All provisions of the Act of Congress
approved.......</p>

fully by said State and its people.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In the event the foregoing propositions are
adopted at said election by a majority of the legal votes cast on said
submission, the proposed constitution of the proposed State of Hawaii, ratified
by the people at the election held on November&nbsp;7, 1950, shall be deemed

deemed amended by inserting the words &quot;at which officers for all state
elective offices provided for by this constitution and two Senators and one
Representative in Congress shall be nominated and elected&quot; in lieu of the
words &quot;at which officers for all state elective offices provided for by
this constitution shall be nominated and elected; but the officers so to be
elected shall in any event include two Senators and two Representatives to the
Congress, and unless and until otherwise required by law, said Representatives
shall be elected at large&quot;.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In the event the foregoing propositions are not

submission, the provisions of this Act shall cease to be effective.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The Governor of Hawaii is hereby authorized and
directed to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to insure the
submission of said propositions to the people.  The return of the votes cast on
said propositions shall be made by the election officers directly to the
Secretary of Hawaii, who shall certify the results of the submission to the
Governor.  The Governor shall certify the results of said submission, as so
ascertained, to the President of the United States.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c) If the President shall find that the
propositions set forth in the preceding subsection have been duly adopted by
the people of Hawaii, the President, upon certification of the returns of the
election of the officers required to be elected as provided in section 6 of
this Act, shall thereupon issue his proclamation announcing the results of said
election as so ascertained.  Upon the issuance of said proclamation by the
President, the State of Hawaii shall be deemed admitted into the Union as
provided in section 1 of this Act.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Until the said State is so admitted into the
Union, the persons holding legislative, executive, and judicial office in,
under, or by authority of the government of said Territory, and the Delegate in
Congress thereof, shall continue to discharge the duties of their respective
offices.  Upon the issuance of said proclamation by the President of the United
States and the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union, the officers
elected at said election, and qualified under the provisions of the
constitution and laws of said State, shall proceed to exercise all the
functions pertaining to their offices in, under, or by authority of the
government of said State, and officers not required to be elected at said
initial election shall be selected or continued in office as provided by the
constitution and laws of said State.  The Governor of said State shall certify
the election of the Senators and Representative in the manner required by law,
and the said Senators and Representative shall be entitled to be admitted to
seats in Congress and to all the rights and privileges of Senators and
Representatives of other States in the Congress of the United States.</p>
