<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §702-224</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section sets forth obvious exceptions which must be made
to the provisions relating to complicity.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Even though a victim of an offense in a limited sense assists
its commission, it seems clear that the victim ought not to be regarded as an
accomplice.  For example, the business person who yields to extortion ought not
be regarded as an accomplice of the extortionist.  Similarly it would be unwise
to regard parents who yield to the threat of kidnappers and clandestinely pay a
ransom as accomplices in the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Other parties who participate in the commission of an offense
and who cannot logically be called victims of the crime raise problems which
call for exclusion from the category of &quot;accomplice.&quot;  In those cases
where the commission of an offense necessarily involves the conduct of two
persons, it is questionable wisdom to push the concept of complicity to its
outer limits.  In the case of an illegal abortion, it is questionable whether a
woman ought to be deemed the accomplice of the abortionist when an abortion is
performed upon her.  Similar questions might be raised about the complicity of
a patron of a prostitute or the complicity of the purchaser in an illegal
sale.  In such cases, if general rules hitherto stated were to control,
prosecutorial rather than legislative discretion would determine how diverse
situations should be handled and the treatment the individuals involved should
receive.  The exemption established by subsection (2) will leave to the
Legislature the determination of what distinctions, if any, ought to be made.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (3) seeks to relieve a person of liability based
on the person's complicity if the reason for its imposition no longer obtains. 
Thus, if the accomplice deprives the accomplice's action of effectiveness
before the offense is committed, the accomplice should not be accountable for
the conduct of another.  What the erstwhile accomplice must do to relieve the
accomplice of potential liability will vary depending on the conduct that
establishes the accomplice's complicity.  More will be required of one who
distributes arms than one who offers verbal encouragement.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Hawaii has recognized in at least one case that the victim of
a crime will not be regarded as an accomplice of the defendant.[1]  Although
two cases in Hawaii have referred to apparent partners in acts of sodomy as
&quot;accomplices,&quot;[2] which would be contrary to subsection (2) of the
Code, the result is without significance because each &quot;accomplice&quot;
would have been liable for the same offense on the basis of the accomplice's
own conduct.  Subsection (3) is substantially in accord with prior law.[3]</p>
