<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§846E-3  Access to registration information.</b> 
(a)  Registration information shall be disclosed as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The information shall be disclosed to law
enforcement agencies for law enforcement purposes;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The information shall be disclosed to government
agencies conducting confidential background checks;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The attorney general and any county police
department shall release public information as provided in subsection (b)
concerning a specific person required to register under this chapter; provided

this chapter shall not be released.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  For purposes of this section, &quot;public
information&quot; means:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Name, prior names, and all aliases used by the
covered offender or under which the covered offender has been known;</p>

disease, disorder, or defect, for a covered offense, or as soon thereafter as
is practical.  When a notice of appeal has been filed, the public information
shall note that the covered offender has filed a notice of appeal.  The public
information shall be removed upon the reversal of the covered offender's
conviction or the granting of a pardon to the covered offender.  Public access
shall continue until the expiration of at least the following periods:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Forty years after sentencing or release,
whichever is later, of a sexually violent predator or a repeat covered offender
with at least two separate convictions for a crime for which this chapter
requires registration, one of which is a felony;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Thirty years after sentencing or release,
whichever is later, of any covered offender who has been convicted of an
aggravated sexual offense;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Twenty-five years after sentencing or release,
whichever is later, of any covered offender who is not subject to paragraph (1)
or (2), and whose most serious covered offense conviction, except for a
conviction under section 707-730(1)(c), is a class A felony or its non-Hawaii
equivalent;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Fifteen years after a covered offender's date of
sentencing or release, whichever is later, for those covered offenders who are
not subject to paragraphs (1) through (3) and whose most serious covered
offense conviction is a class B felony, or a conviction under section
707-730(1)(c), or its non-Hawaii equivalent; or</p>

conviction is a class C felony or its non-Hawaii equivalent; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Have been convicted of a second or
subsequent misdemeanor covered offense when all of the previous covered
offenses are also misdemeanors.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Public access authorized by this section
shall be accomplished by the following methods:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Public access to the public information for each
covered offender subject to subsection (c), paragraphs (1) through (4) shall be
provided by both public internet access and on-site public access or;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Public access to the public information for each
covered offender subject to subsection (c), paragraph (5) shall be provided by
on-site public access;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that on-site public access shall be
provided for each covered offender at the Hawaii criminal justice data center
and at one or more designated police stations in each county, to be designated
by the attorney general, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on
weekdays, excluding holidays.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  After forty years have elapsed after
release or sentencing, whichever is later, for covered offenders subject to
subsection (c), paragraph (1); thirty years have elapsed after release or
sentencing, whichever is later, for covered offenders subject to subsection
(c), paragraph (2); twenty-five years have elapsed after release or sentencing,
whichever is later, for covered offenders subject to subsection (c), paragraph
(3); fifteen years have elapsed after release or sentencing, whichever is later
for covered offenders subject to subsection (c), paragraph (4); and ten years
have elapsed after release or sentencing, whichever is later, for covered
offenders subject to subsection (c), paragraph (5), a covered offender may
petition the court in a civil proceeding to terminate public access.  In the
civil proceeding to terminate public access, the State shall be represented by
the attorney general; provided that the attorney general, with the prosecuting
agency's consent, may designate the prosecuting agency that prosecuted the
covered offender for the most recent covered offense within the State to
represent the State.  For covered offenders who have never been convicted of a
covered offense within the State of Hawaii, the attorney general shall
represent the State; provided that the attorney general, with the prosecuting
agency's consent, may designate the prosecuting agency for the county in which
the covered offender resides to represent the State.  The court may order this
termination upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the covered
offender:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Has had no new convictions for covered offenses;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Is very unlikely to commit a covered offense ever
again; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Public access to the covered offender's public
information will not assist in protecting the safety of the public or any
member thereof;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that a denial by the court for relief
pursuant to a petition under this section shall preclude the filing of another
petition for five years from the date of the last denial.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>     (f)  If a
covered offender has been convicted of only one covered offense and that
covered offense is a misdemeanor, the covered offender shall not be subject to
the public access requirements set forth in this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The following message shall be posted at
both the site of internet access and on-site public access locations:</p>

<p class=aSubsectionunderscored style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-.5in;
line-height:normal'><span style='text-decoration:none'>     &quot;Information
regarding covered offenders is permitted pursuant to chapter 846E.  Public
access to this information is based solely on the fact of each offender's
criminal conviction and is not based on an estimate of the offender's level of
dangerousness.  By allowing public access to this information, the State makes
no representation as to whether the covered offenders listed are dangerous. 
Any person who uses the information in this registry to injure, harass, or
commit a criminal act against any person included in the registry may be
subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability, or both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The public access provisions of this
section shall apply to all covered offenders without regard to the date of
conviction.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  &quot;Conviction&quot; as used in this
section means:</p>

<p class=1Paragraphunderscored style='line-height:normal'><span
style='text-decoration:none'>     (1)  A judgment on the verdict, or a finding
of guilt after a plea of [guilty] or nolo contendere, excluding the
adjudication of a minor;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraphunderscored style='line-height:normal'><span
style='text-decoration:none'>     (2)  A finding of unfitness to proceed
resulting in the release of the covered offender into the community, excluding
such a finding as to a minor; or</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  An acquittal due to a physical or mental disease,
disorder, or defect pursuant to chapter 704 resulting in the release of the
covered offender into the community, excluding such acquittal as to a minor. [L
1997, c 316, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 194, §3; am L 2002, c 234, §2; am L 2003, c
62, §5; am L 2004, c 59, §3; am L 2005, c 45, §5; am L 2006, c 106, §3]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As this section operated to deprive defendant of a protected
liberty interest and provided defendant with neither notice nor an opportunity
to be heard prior to notifying the public of defendant's status as a convicted
sex offender, this section denied defendant due process under article I, §5 of
the Hawaii constitution; this section thus void and unenforceable.  97 H. 285,
36 P.3d 1255.</p>
