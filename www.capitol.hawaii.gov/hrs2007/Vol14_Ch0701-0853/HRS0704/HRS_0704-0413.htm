<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§704-413  Conditional release; application
for modification or discharge; termination of conditional release and
commitment.</b>  (1)  Any person released pursuant to section 704-411 shall
continue to receive mental health or other treatment and care deemed appropriate
by the director of health until discharged from conditional release.  The
person shall follow all prescribed treatments and take all prescribed
medications according to the instructions of the person's treating mental
health professional.  If any mental health professional treating any
conditionally released person believes either the person is not complying with
the requirements of this section or there is other evidence that
hospitalization is appropriate, the mental health professional shall report the
matter to the probation officer of the conditionally released person.  The
probation officer may order the conditionally released person to be
hospitalized for a period not to exceed seventy-two hours if the probation
officer has probable cause to believe the person has violated the requirements
of this subsection.  No person shall be hospitalized beyond the seventy-two
hour period, as computed pursuant to section 1-29, unless a hearing has been
held pursuant to subsection (3).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Any person released pursuant to section
704-411 may apply to the court ordering the conditional release for discharge
from, or modification of, the order granting conditional release on the ground
that the person is no longer affected by a physical or mental disease, disorder,
or defect and may be discharged, or the order may be modified, without danger
to the person or to others.  The application shall be accompanied by a letter
from or supporting affidavit of a qualified physician or licensed
psychologist.  A copy of the application and letter or affidavit shall be
transmitted to the prosecuting attorney of the circuit from which the order
issued and to any persons supervising the release, and the hearing on the
application shall be held following notice to such persons.  If the
determination of the court is adverse to the application, the person shall not
be permitted to file further application until one year has elapsed from the
date of any preceding hearing on an application for modification of conditions
of release or for discharge.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  If, at any time after the order pursuant
to section 704-411 granting conditional release, the court determines, after
hearing evidence, that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   The person is still affected by a physical or
mental disease, disorder, or defect, and the conditions of release have not
been fulfilled; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   For the safety of the person or others, the
person's conditional release should be revoked,</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>the court may forthwith modify the conditions of
release or order the person to be committed to the custody of the director of
health, subject to discharge or release only in accordance with the procedure
prescribed in section 704-412. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1983, c 189, §1; am
L 1988, c 305, §8; am L 1997, c 306, §4; am L 2006, c 230, §12]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §704-413</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  What has been said in the commentary to §704-412 applies with
equal force to applications, by a person released on condition, for discharge
or for modification of conditions of release.  The criterion of dangerousness
is still applicable.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (2) limits the time during which a person released
on condition remains subject to recommitment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §704-413</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 189, Session Laws 1983, added a new subsection (1) which
requires continued psychological or psychiatric treatment of persons
conditionally released after being committed pursuant to section 704-411. 
Assurance of continued treatment was felt necessary for the safety and welfare
of both the community and the person conditionally released.  This section was
further amended to provide for the recommittal of persons conditionally
released or the modification of the conditions of their release.  Senate
Conference Committee Report No. 26.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 305, Session Laws 1988, included licensed psychologists
among the professionals which may provide offender examination services to the Hawaii criminal justice system.  The legislature stated that the present laws, which permit
only psychiatric evaluation, are inconsistent with the many and varied uses the
court has found for the services of licensed psychologists.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 2153.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 306, Session Laws 1997, amended this section to require
that any person released on condition pursuant to §704-411 shall receive mental
health or other appropriate treatment and care until discharged from
conditional release.  The amendment streamlines the process for committing and
releasing mentally incompetent defendants.  Senate Standing Committee Report
No. 98.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section, among
others, to ensure that the person's physical or mental disease, disorder, or
defect is considered in commitment and release provisions.   House Standing
Committee Report No. 665-06.</p>
