<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§514C-22  Power of association of apartment
owners to negotiate, purchase, and sell lessor's interest.</b>  (a)  The
association of apartment owners may purchase the lessor's interest in the
condominium project; provided that the declaration of condominium property
regime shall either contain or be amended to include a provision authorizing
the board of directors to effectuate such a purchase.  If the lessor is also a
condominium unit lessee, the lessor's lessee interest shall be disregarded in
the computation of the percentage of condominium unit lessees needed to achieve
the vote or written consent required to amend the declaration of condominium
property regime.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If the association of apartment owners is
authorized to purchase the lessor's interest pursuant to this section, the
following powers, in addition to any other existing powers, shall be conferred
upon the association of apartment owners:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To purchase or otherwise acquire, own, improve,
use, and deal in and with the lessor's interest in the leased fee interest
appurtenant to the various condominium units in the condominium project and in
the various apartment and ground leases including but not limited to the
interest of any sublessor or any or all undivided interests therein;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  To incur liabilities, borrow money, and secure
any of its obligations by mortgage or pledge all or any portion of its
property, assessments, and funds to effectuate acquisition of the lessor's
interest;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  To assess, except as provided in subsection (d),
as a common expense, the expenses incurred in acquiring and holding the leased
fee interest, and to service any debt associated therewith; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  To sell the leased fee interest in a condominium
unit and acquired from the lessor by the association of apartment owners, to
the then condominium unit lessee or subsequent purchaser of such unit; provided
that if the lessee or subsequent purchaser declines to purchase the leased fee
interest, the leased fee interest may be sold to other persons so long as
reasonable disclosure is made of the association of apartment owners' intent to
sell the leased fee interest to such other persons, and the disclosure includes
a statement that the lessees may have no legal remedy if they subsequently wish
to purchase the leased fee interest and the other persons refuse to sell or
will sell only at a price unacceptable to the lessees.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  No condominium unit lessee shall be
compelled to purchase the leased fee interest in such condominium unit and
acquired from the lessor by the association of apartment owners, but may
instead pay lease rent to the association of apartment owners together with the
lessee's share of the common expenses incurred in acquiring the leased fee
interest in the condominium units in the project including any debt associated
therewith.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If some, but not all, lessees have
purchased the leased fee interest in their condominium units directly from the
lessor, (other than purchases by the lessor or the association of apartment
owners), the association of apartment owners may undertake the purchase of all
or any part of the leased fee interest in the remaining leasehold condominium
units in the project in accordance with subsection (b); provided that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Sixty-seven per cent of the remaining lessees
approve an amendment to the declaration authorizing the purchase of the leased
fee interest by the association consistent with the requirements of this
section;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  All costs and expenses and all proceeds and
benefits of acquiring and holding the leased fee interest and to service any
debt associated therewith shall be separately assessed or credited to the
condominium units of the remaining lessees in the same ratio that the common
interest appurtenant to each remaining lessees' apartment bears to the total
common interest appurtenant to all of the remaining lessees' condominium units;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The association of apartment owners shall sell
the leased fee interest in a condominium unit only to the lessee of the
condominium unit or to the permitted assigns or successors of the lessee;
provided that if the lessee or the lessee's permitted assigns or successors
decline to purchase the leased fee interest, the leased fee interest may be
sold to other persons so long as reasonable disclosure is made of the
association of apartment owners' intent to sell the leased fee interest to the
other persons and the disclosure includes a statement that the lessees may have
no legal remedy if they subsequently wish to purchase the leased fee interest
and the other persons refuse to sell or will sell only at a price unacceptable
to the lessees; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The association of apartment owners, through its
board of directors in the exercise of its authority, may decide not to accept
an offer from the lessor to sell all of the remaining portion of the lessor's
interest to the association of apartment owners on the basis that the purchase
is not financially feasible or is otherwise not in the best interests of the
association.  In that event, the board shall adopt a resolution containing
written findings as to its reasons for not accepting the offer and shall
distribute the resolution to the remaining lessees.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  If the association of apartment owners
acquires all of the remaining portion of the lessor's interest in accordance
with subsection (d), any debt associated therewith shall be secured only by the
interests so acquired and by the common expense assessments upon the
condominium units of the remaining lessees.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  For purposes of this section:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Remaining lessees&quot; means the lessees
of condominium units  in a condominium project who have not purchased the
leased fee interest in their condominium units as of the effective date of the
amendment referred to in subsection (d)(1).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Condominium unit&quot; has the same
meaning as the term &quot;unit&quot; as defined in section 514B-3. [L 1999, c
241, pt of §2; am L 2002, c 199, §2; am L 2004, c 164, §20; am L 2006, c 273,
§31]</p>
