<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§523A-6]  Bank deposits and funds in
financial organizations.</b>  (a)  Any demand, savings, or matured time deposit
with a banking or financial organization, including a deposit that is
automatically renewable, and any funds paid toward the purchase of a share, a
mutual investment certificate, or any other interest in a banking or financial
organization is presumed abandoned unless the owner, within five years has: </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  In the case of a deposit, increased or decreased
its amount or presented the passbook or other similar evidence of the deposit
for the crediting of interest;</p>

financial organization concerning the property; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Otherwise indicated an interest in the property
as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file prepared by an employee of
the banking or financial organization; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Owned other property to which paragraph (1), (2),
or (3) applies and if the banking or financial organization communicates in
writing with the owner with regard to the property that would otherwise be
presumed abandoned under this subsection at the address to which communications
regarding the other property regularly are sent; or </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Had another relationship with the banking or

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Communicated in writing with the banking
or financial organization; or </p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Otherwise indicated an interest as
evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file prepared by an employee of
the banking or financial organization and if the banking or financial
organization communicates in writing with the owner with regard to the property
that would otherwise be abandoned under this subsection at the address to which
communications regarding the other relationship regularly are sent. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  For purposes of subsection (a) property
includes interest and dividends. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A holder shall not impose with respect to
property described in subsection (a) any charge due to dormancy or inactivity
or cease payment of interest unless: </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  There is an enforceable written contract between
the holder and the owner of the property pursuant to which the holder may
impose a charge or cease payment of interest; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  For property in excess of $2, the holder, no more
than three months before the initial imposition of those charges or cessation
of interest, has given written notice to the owner of the amount of those
charges at the last known address of the owner stating that those charges will
be imposed or that interest will cease, but the notice provided in this section
need not be given with respect to charges imposed or interest ceased before May
18, 1983; and </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The holder regularly imposes such charges or
ceases payment of interest and does not regularly reverse or otherwise cancel
them or retroactively credit interest with respect to the property. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Any property described in subsection (a)
that is automatically renewable is matured for purposes of subsection (a) upon
the expiration of its initial time period, but in the case of any renewal to
which the owner consents at or about the time of renewal by communicating in
writing with the banking or financial organization or otherwise indicating
consent as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file prepared by an
employee of the organization, the property is matured upon the expiration of
the last time period for which consent was given.  If, at the time provided for
delivery in section 523A-19, a penalty or forfeiture in the payment of interest
would result from the delivery of the property, the time for delivery is
extended until the time when no penalty or forfeiture would result. [L 1983, c
37, pt of §2]</p>
