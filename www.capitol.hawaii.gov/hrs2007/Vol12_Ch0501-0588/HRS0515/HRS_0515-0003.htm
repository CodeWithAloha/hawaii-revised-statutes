immunodeficiency virus infection:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To refuse to engage in a real estate transaction
with a person;</p>

bona fide offer to engage in a real estate transaction from a person;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  To refuse to negotiate for a real estate

seeking to engage in a real estate transaction;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  To print, circulate, post, or mail, or cause to
be published a statement, advertisement, or sign, or to use a form of
application for a real estate transaction, or to make a record or inquiry in
connection with a prospective real estate transaction, that indicates, directly
or indirectly, an intent to make a limitation, specification, or discrimination
with respect thereto;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  To offer, solicit, accept, use, or retain a
listing of real property with the understanding that a person may be
discriminated against in a real estate transaction or in the furnishing of
facilities or services in connection therewith;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  To refuse to engage in a real estate transaction
with a person or to deny equal opportunity to use and enjoy a housing
accommodation due to a disability because the person uses the services of a

include any restriction that allows any owner or person to refuse to negotiate
or refuse to engage in a real estate transaction; provided that as used in this
paragraph, the &quot;reasonableness&quot; of a restriction shall be examined by
giving due consideration to the needs of a reasonable prudent person in the
same or similar circumstances.  Depending on the circumstances, a
&quot;reasonable restriction&quot; may require the owner of the service animal,
guide dog, or signal dog to comply with one or more of the following:</p>

syndrome;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  To refuse to permit, at the expense of a person
with a disability, reasonable modifications to existing premises occupied or to

the person agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition
that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  To refuse to make reasonable accommodations in

covered multifamily housing accommodations for first occupancy after March 13,
1991, to fail to design and construct housing accommodations in such a manner
that:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  The housing accommodations have at least
one accessible entrance, unless it is impractical to do so because of the
terrain or unusual characteristics of the site; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  With respect to housing accommodations

accessible by wheelchair; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (13)  To discriminate against or deny a person access
to, or membership or participation in any multiple listing service, real estate
broker's organization, or other service, organization, or facility involved
either directly or indirectly in real estate transactions, or to discriminate
against any person in the terms or conditions of such access, membership, or
