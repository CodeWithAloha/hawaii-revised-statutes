<p class=RegularParagraphs>     §<b>514A-12  Copy of the floor plans to be
filed.</b>  Simultaneously with the recording of the declaration, there shall
be filed in the office of the recording officer a set of the floor plans and
elevations of the building or buildings, showing the layout, location,
apartment numbers, and dimensions of the apartments, stating the name of the
property or that it has no name, and bearing the statement of a registered
architect or professional engineer certifying that it is an accurate copy of
portions of the plans of the building or buildings as filed with the county or
city and county officer having jurisdiction over the issuance of permits for
the construction of buildings and, if construction of the building or buildings
is completed, as approved by the county or city and county officer.  If the
plans do not include a statement by the architect or engineer that the plans
fully and accurately depict the layout, location, apartment numbers, and
dimensions of the apartments as approved by the county or city and county
officer having jurisdiction over the issuance of permits for the construction
of buildings and as built, there shall be recorded within thirty days from the
date of completion of the building or buildings as &quot;date of

the building or buildings, whichever shall first occur, an amendment to the
declaration to which shall be attached a statement of a registered architect or
professional engineer certifying that the final plans theretofore filed, or
being filed simultaneously with such amendment, fully and accurately depict the
layout, location, apartment numbers, and dimensions of the apartments as
approved by the county or city and county officer having jurisdiction over the
issuance of permits for the construction of buildings and as built, which
amendment shall require only the vote or written consent of the declarant or
such other person or persons as are provided in the declaration.  The plans
shall be kept by the recording officer as provided by rules adopted by the
department of land and natural resources, pursuant to chapter 91, indexed in
the same manner as a conveyance entitled to record, numbered serially in the
order of receipt, each designated &quot;apartment ownership&quot;, with the
name of the property, if any, and each containing an appropriate reference to
the recording of the declaration.  Correspondingly, the record of the
declaration shall contain a reference to the file number of the floor plans of
the building or buildings on the property affected thereby. [L 1977, c 98, pt
