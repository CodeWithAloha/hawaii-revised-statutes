<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§235-55.85  Refundable food/excise tax
credit.</b>  (a)  Each resident individual taxpayer, who files an individual
income tax return for a taxable year, and who is not claimed or is not
otherwise eligible to be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer for federal
or Hawaii state individual income tax purposes, may claim a refundable
food/excise tax credit against the resident taxpayer's individual income tax
liability for the taxable year for which the individual income tax return is
being filed; provided that a resident individual who has no income or no income
taxable under this chapter and who is not claimed or is not otherwise eligible
to be claimed as a dependent by a taxpayer for federal or Hawaii state
individual income tax purposes may claim this credit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Each resident individual taxpayer may
claim a refundable food/excise tax credit multiplied by the number of qualified
exemptions to which the taxpayer is entitled in accordance with the table
below; provided that a husband and wife filing separate tax returns for a
taxable year for which a joint return could have been filed by them shall claim
only the tax credit to which they would have been entitled had a joint return
been filed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Adjusted gross income       Credit per
exemption</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Under $5,000                         $85</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     $5,000 under $10,000                  75</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     $10,000 under $15,000                 65</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     $15,000 under $20,000                 55</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     $20,000 under $30,000                 45</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     $30,000 under $40,000                 35</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     $40,000 under $50,000                 25</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     $50,000 and over                       0</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  For the purposes of this section, a
qualified exemption is defined to include those exemptions permitted under this
chapter; provided that no additional exemption may be claimed by a taxpayer who
is sixty-five years of age or older; provided that a person for whom exemption
is claimed has physically resided in the State for more than nine months during
the taxable year; and provided further that multiple exemptions shall not be
granted because of deficiencies in vision or hearing, or other disability.  For
purposes of claiming this credit only, a minor child receiving support from the
department of human services of the State, social security survivor's benefits,
and the like, may be considered a dependent and a qualified exemption of the
parent or guardian.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The tax credit under this section shall
not be available to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Any person who has been convicted of a felony and
who has been committed to prison and has been physically confined for the full
taxable year;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Any person who would otherwise be eligible to be
claimed as a dependent but who has been committed to a youth correctional
facility and has resided at the facility for the full taxable year; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any misdemeanant who has been committed to jail
and has been physically confined for the full taxable year.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The tax credits claimed by a resident
taxpayer pursuant to this section shall be deductible from the resident
taxpayer's individual income tax liability, if any, for the tax year in which
they are properly claimed.  If the tax credits claimed by a resident taxpayer
exceed the amount of income tax payment due from the resident taxpayer, the
excess of credits over payments due shall be refunded to the resident taxpayer;
provided that tax credits properly claimed by a resident individual who has no
income tax liability shall be paid to the resident individual; and provided
further that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credits allowed by
this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  All claims for tax credits under this
section, including any amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of
the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credits
may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall
constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  For the purposes of this section,
&quot;adjusted gross income&quot; means adjusted gross income as defined by the
Internal Revenue Code. [L 1998, c 157, §1; am L 2007, c 211, §1]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Note</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The 2007 amendment applies to taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2007.  L 2007, c 211, §3.</p>
