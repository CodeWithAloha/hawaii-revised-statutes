<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§226&#8209;3]  Overall theme.</b>  Hawaii's
people, as both individuals and groups, generally accept and live by a number
of principles or values which are an integral part of society.  This concept is
the unifying theme of the state plan.  The following principles or values are
established as the overall theme of the Hawaii state plan: </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Individual and family self-sufficiency refers to
the rights of people to maintain as much self-reliance as possible.  It is an
expression of the value of independence, in other words, being able to freely
pursue personal interests and goals.  Self-sufficiency means that individuals
and families can express and maintain their own self-interest so long as that
self-interest does not adversely affect the general welfare.  Individual
freedom and individual achievement are possible only by reason of other people
in society, the institutions, arrangements and customs that they maintain, and
the rights and responsibilities that they sanction. </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Social and economic mobility refers to the right
of individuals to choose and to have the opportunities for choice available to
them.  It is a corollary to self-sufficiency.  Social and economic mobility
means that opportunities and incentives are available for people to seek out
their own levels of social and economic fulfillment. </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Community or social well-being is a value that
encompasses many things.  In essence, it refers to healthy social, economic,
and physical environments that benefit the community as a whole.  A sense of
social responsibility, of caring for others and for the well-being of our
community and of participating in social and political life, are important
aspects of this concept.  It further implies the aloha spirit--attitudes of
tolerance, respect, cooperation and unselfish giving, within which Hawaii's
society can progress.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     One of the basic functions of our society is to
enhance the ability of individuals and groups to pursue their goals freely, to
satisfy basic needs and to secure desired socio-economic levels.  The elements
of choice and mobility within society's legal framework are fundamental
rights.  Society's role is to encourage conditions within which individuals and
groups can approach their desired levels of self-reliance and
self-determination.  This enables people to gain confidence and self-esteem;
citizens contribute more when they possess such qualities in a free and open
society. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Government promotes citizen freedom,
self-reliance, self-determination, social and civic responsibility and goals
achievement by keeping order, by increasing cooperation among many diverse
individuals and groups, and by fostering social and civic responsibilities that
affect the general welfare.  The greater the number and activities of
individuals and groups, the more complex government's role becomes.  The
function of government, however, is to assist citizens in attaining their
goals.  Government provides for meaningful participation by the people in
decision-making and for effective access to authority as well as an equitable
sharing of benefits.  Citizens have a responsibility to work with their
government to contribute to society's improvement.  They must also conduct
their activities within an agreed-upon legal system that protects human rights.
