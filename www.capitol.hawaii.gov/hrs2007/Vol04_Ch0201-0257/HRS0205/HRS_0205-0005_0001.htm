<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §205-5.1  Geothermal resource subzones.</b> 
(a)  Geothermal resource subzones may be designated within the urban, rural,
agricultural, and conservation land use districts established under section
205-2.  Only those areas designated as geothermal resource subzones may be
utilized for geothermal development activities in addition to those uses
permitted in each land use district under this chapter.  Geothermal development
activities may be permitted within urban, rural, agricultural, and conservation
land use districts in accordance with this chapter.  &quot;Geothermal
development activities&quot; means the exploration, development, or production
of electrical energy from geothermal resources and direct use applications of
geothermal resources; provided that within the urban, rural, and agricultural
land use districts, direct use applications of geothermal resources are
permitted both within and outside of areas designated as geothermal resource
subzones pursuant to section 205-5.2 if such direct use applications are in conformance
with all other applicable state and county land use regulations and are in
conformance with this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The board of land and natural resources
shall have the responsibility for designating areas as geothermal resource
subzones as provided under section 205-5.2; except that the total area within
an agricultural district which is the subject of a geothermal mining lease
approved by the board of land and natural resources, any part or all of which
area is the subject of a special use permit issued by the county for geothermal
development activities, on or before May 25, 1984, is designated as a
geothermal resource subzone for the duration of the lease.  The designation of
geothermal resource subzones shall be governed exclusively by this section and
section 205-5.2, except as provided therein.  The board shall adopt, amend, or
repeal rules related to its authority to designate and regulate the use of
geothermal resource subzones in the manner provided under chapter&nbsp;91.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The authority of the board to designate
geothermal resource subzones shall be an exception to those provisions of this
chapter and of section 46-4 authorizing the land use commission and the
counties to establish and modify land use districts and to regulate uses
therein.  The provisions of this section shall not abrogate nor supersede the
provisions of chapters 182, 183, and 183C.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The use of an area for geothermal
development activities within a geothermal resource subzone shall be governed
by the board within the conservation district and, except as herein provided,
by state and county statutes, ordinances, and rules not inconsistent herewith
within agricultural, rural, and urban districts, except that no land use
commission approval or special use permit procedures under section 205-6 shall
be required for the use of such subzones.  In the absence of provisions in the
county general plan and zoning ordinances specifically relating to the use and
location of geothermal development activities in an agricultural, rural, or urban
district, the appropriate county authority may issue a geothermal resource
permit to allow geothermal development activities.  &quot;Appropriate county
authority&quot; means the county planning commission unless some other agency
or body is designated by ordinance of the county council.  Such uses as are
permitted by county general plan and zoning ordinances, by the appropriate
county authority, shall be deemed to be reasonable and to promote the
effectiveness and objectives of this chapter.  Chapters 177, 178, 182, 183,
183C, 205A, 226, 342, and 343 shall apply as appropriate.  If provisions in the
county general plan and zoning ordinances specifically relate to the use and
location of geothermal development activities in an agricultural, rural, or
urban district, the provisions shall require the appropriate county authority
to conduct a public hearing on any application for a geothermal resource permit
to determine whether the use is in conformity with the criteria specified in
subsection (e) for granting geothermal resource permits; provided that within
the urban, rural, and agricultural land use districts, direct use applications
of geothermal resources are permitted without any application for a geothermal
resource permit both within and outside of areas designated as geothermal
resource subzones pursuant to section 205-5.2 if such direct use applications
are in conformance with all other applicable state and county land use
regulations and are in conformance with this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If geothermal development activities are
proposed within a conservation district, with an application with all required
data, the board of land and natural resources shall conduct a public hearing
and, upon appropriate request for mediation from any party who submitted
comment at the public hearing, the board shall appoint a mediator within five
days.  The board shall require the parties to participate in mediation.  The
mediator shall not be a member of the board or its staff.  The mediation period
shall not extend beyond thirty days after the date mediation started, except by
order of the board.  Mediation shall be confined to the issues raised at the
public hearing by the party requesting mediation.  The mediator will submit a
written recommendation to the board, based upon any mediation agreement reached
between the parties for consideration by the board in its final decision.  If
there is no mediation agreement, the board may have a second public hearing to
receive additional comment related to the mediation issues.  Within ten days
after the second public hearing, the board may receive additional written
comment on the issues raised at the second public hearing from any party.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The board shall consider the comments raised at
the second hearing before rendering its final decision.  The board shall then
determine whether, pursuant to board rules, a conservation district use permit
shall be granted to authorize the geothermal development activities described
in the application.  The board shall grant a conservation district use permit
if it finds that the applicant has demonstrated that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The desired uses would not have unreasonable
adverse health, environmental, or socio-economic effects on residents or
surrounding property; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The desired uses would not unreasonably burden public
agencies to provide roads and streets, sewers, water, drainage, and police and
fire protection; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  There are reasonable measures available to
mitigate the unreasonable adverse effects or burdens referred to above.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     A decision shall be made by the board within
six months of the date a complete application was filed; provided that the time
limit may be extended by agreement between the applicant and the board.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  If geothermal development activities are
proposed within agricultural, rural, or urban districts and such proposed
activities are not permitted uses pursuant to county general plan and zoning
ordinances, then after receipt of a properly filed and completed application,
including all required supporting data, the appropriate county authority shall
conduct a public hearing.  Upon appropriate request for mediation from any
party who submitted comment at the public hearing, the county authority shall
appoint a mediator within five days.  The county authority shall require the
parties to participate in mediation.  The mediator shall not be an employee of
any county agency or its staff.  The mediation period shall not extend beyond
thirty days after mediation started, except by order of the county authority. 
Mediation shall be confined to the issues raised at the public hearing by the
party requesting mediation.  The mediator will submit a written recommendation
to the county authority, based upon any mediation agreement reached between the
parties for consideration by the county authority in its final decision.  If
there is no mediation agreement, the county authority may have a second public
hearing to receive additional comment related to the mediation issues.  Within
ten days after the second public hearing, the county authority may receive additional
written comment on the issues raised at the second public hearing from any
party.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The county authority shall consider the
comments raised at the second hearing before rendering its final decision.  The
county authority shall then determine whether a geothermal resource permit
shall be granted to authorize the geothermal development activities described
in the application.  The appropriate county authority shall grant a geothermal
resource permit if it finds that applicant has demonstrated that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The desired uses would not have unreasonable
adverse health, environmental, or socio-economic effects on residents or
surrounding property;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The desired uses would not unreasonably burden
public agencies to provide roads and streets, sewers, water, drainage, school
improvements, and police and fire protection; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  That there are reasonable measures available to
mitigate the unreasonable adverse effects or burdens referred to above.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Unless there is a mutual agreement to extend, a
decision shall be made on the application by the appropriate county authority
within six months of the date a complete application was filed; provided that
the time limit may be extended by agreement between the applicant and the
appropriate county authority.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Requests for mediation shall be received
by the board or county authority within five days after the close of the
initial public hearing.  Within five days thereafter, the board or county
authority shall appoint a mediator.  Any person submitting an appropriate
request for mediation shall be notified by the board or county authority of the
date, time, and place of the mediation conference by depositing such notice in
the mail to the return address stated on the request for mediation.  The notice
shall be mailed no later than ten days before the start of the mediation
conference.  The conference shall be held on the island where the public
hearing is held.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Any decision made by an appropriate county
authority or the board pursuant to a public hearing or hearings under this
section may be appealed directly on the record to the intermediate appellate
court for final decision and shall not be subject to a contested case hearing. 
Sections 91-14(b) and (g) shall govern the appeal, notwithstanding the lack of
a contested case hearing on the matter.  The appropriate county authority or
the board shall provide a court reporter to produce a transcript of the
proceedings at all public hearings under this section for purposes of an
appeal.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  For the purposes of an appeal from a
decision from a public hearing, the record shall include:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The application for the permit and all
accompanying supporting documents, including but not limited to: reports,
studies, affidavits, statements, and exhibits.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Staff recommendations submitted to the members of
the agency in consideration of the application.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Oral and written public testimony received at the
public hearings.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Written transcripts of the proceedings at the
public hearings.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The written recommendation received by the agency
from the mediator with any mediation agreement.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  A statement of relevant matters noticed by the
agency members at the public hearings.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  The written decision of the agency issued in
connection with the application and public hearings.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Other documents required by the board or county
authority. [L 1983, c 296, pt of §3; am L 1984, c 151, §2; am L 1985, c 226,
