<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Uses not expressly permitted in subsection
(a) shall be prohibited, except the uses permitted as provided in sections
205-6 and 205-8, and construction of single-family dwellings on lots existing
before June 4, 1976.  Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, no
subdivision of land within the agricultural district with soil classified by
the land study bureau's detailed land classification as overall (master)
productivity rating class A or B shall be approved by a county unless those A

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If the foregoing requirement of encumbrances
running with the land jeopardizes the owner or lessee in obtaining mortgage
financing from any of the mortgage lending agencies set forth in the following
paragraph, and the requirement is the sole reason for failure to obtain
mortgage financing, then the requirement of encumbrances shall, insofar as such
mortgage financing is jeopardized, be conditionally waived by the appropriate
county enforcement officer; provided that the conditional waiver shall become
effective only in the event that the property is subjected to foreclosure
proceedings by the mortgage lender.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The mortgage lending agencies referred to in
the preceding paragraph are the Federal Housing Administration, Federal
National Mortgage Association, Veterans Administration, Small Business
Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, Federal Land Bank of

lands with soil classified by the land study bureau's detailed land classification
as overall (master) productivity rating class C, D, E, or U shall be restricted

this chapter to the contrary, plantation community subdivisions as defined in
this section shall be permitted uses within the agricultural district, and
section 205-8 shall not apply.</p>

contrary, agricultural lands may be subdivided and leased for the agricultural
uses or activities permitted in subsection (a); provided that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The principal use of the leased land is
agriculture;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  No permanent or temporary dwellings or farm
dwellings, including trailers and campers, are constructed on the leased area. 
This restriction shall not prohibit the construction of storage sheds,
equipment sheds, or other structures appropriate to the agricultural activity
carried on within the lot; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The lease term for a subdivided lot shall be for
at least as long as the greater of:</p>

dedication period of the county in which the subdivided lot is located; or</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000
(RLUIPA), assuming it was constitutional, did not facially invalidate Hawaii's
land use law, where plaintiffs challenged this section and §205-6 to the extent
the sections required a religious organization to obtain a special use permit,
as violations of the &quot;equal terms&quot; and &quot;nondiscrimination&quot;
provisions of the RLUIPA.  229 F. Supp. 2d 1056.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Communications equipment buildings&quot; and
&quot;utility lines&quot; in subsection (a)(7) do not encompass
&quot;telecommunications antennas&quot; or &quot;transmission antennas&quot;
such as a cellular telephone tower; public utility thus had to apply for a
special permit under §205-6 to place the tower in a state agricultural
district.  90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under subsection (a)(4) and (10), a chimney and garage are
permitted as accessories to a farm dwelling; however, utilizing the chimney to
conceal an antenna and the garage to house communication equipment were not
permitted uses under either paragraph (4) or (10).  106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the circumstances of the case, the residence and the
chimney with the concealed antenna constituted a &quot;communications equipment
building&quot; and, thus, were permitted uses under subsection (a)(7); also, as
the garage was not abnormally large and was designed specifically to store the
communications equipment for the concealed antenna, utilizing the permitted
garage structure to house the communications equipment for the antenna was a
permitted use under subsection (a)(7).  106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930.</p>
