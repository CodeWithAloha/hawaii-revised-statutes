unimproved real property; provided that the agency shall consider environmental
factors and available alternatives in its feasibility or planning studies;
provided further that an environmental assessment for proposed uses under

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  Power&#8209;generating facility.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Whenever an agency proposes an action in
subsection (a), other than feasibility or planning studies for possible future
programs or projects that the agency has not approved, adopted, or funded, or
other than the use of state or county funds for the acquisition of unimproved
real property that is not a specific type of action declared exempt under
section 343-6, the agency shall prepare an environmental assessment for such
action at the earliest practicable time to determine whether an environmental
impact statement shall be required.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  For environmental assessments for which a finding
of no significant impact is anticipated:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  A draft environmental assessment shall be
made available for public review and comment for a period of thirty days;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The office shall inform the public of the
availability of the draft environmental assessment for public review and
comment pursuant to section 343-3;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  The agency shall respond in writing to
comments received during the review and prepare a final environmental
assessment to determine whether an environmental impact statement shall be
required;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  A statement shall be required if the
agency finds that the proposed action may have a significant effect on the
environment; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  The agency shall file notice of such
determination with the office.  When a conflict of interest may exist because
the proposing agency and the agency making the determination are the same, the
office may review the agency's determination, consult the agency, and advise
the agency of potential conflicts, to comply with this section.  The office
shall publish the final determination for the public's information pursuant to
section 343-3.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The draft and final statements, if required,
shall be prepared by the agency and submitted to the office.  The draft
statement shall be made available for public review and comment through the
office for a period of forty-five days.  The office shall inform the public of
the availability of the draft statement for public review and comment pursuant
to section 343-3.  The agency shall respond in writing to comments received
during the review and prepare a final statement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The office, when requested by the agency, may
make a recommendation as to the acceptability of the final statement.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The final authority to accept a final statement
shall rest with:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  The governor, or the governor's authorized
representative, whenever an action proposes the use of state lands or the use
of state funds, or whenever a state agency proposes an action within the
categories in subsection (a); or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The mayor, or the mayor's authorized
representative, of the respective county whenever an action proposes only the
use of county lands or county funds.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Acceptance of a required final statement shall
be a condition precedent to implementation of the proposed action. Upon
acceptance or nonacceptance of the final statement, the governor or mayor, or
the governor's or mayor's authorized representative, shall file notice of such
determination with the office.  The office, in turn, shall publish the
determination of acceptance or nonacceptance pursuant to section 343-3.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Whenever an applicant proposes an action
specified by subsection (a) that requires approval of an agency and that is not
a specific type of action declared exempt under section 343-6, the agency
initially receiving and agreeing to process the request for approval shall
prepare an environmental assessment of the proposed action at the earliest
practicable time to determine whether an environmental impact statement shall
be required.  The final approving agency for the request for approval is not
required to be the accepting authority.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     For environmental assessments for which a
finding of no significant impact is anticipated:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A draft environmental assessment shall be made
available for public review and comment for a period of thirty days;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The office shall inform the public of the
availability of the draft environmental assessment for public review and
comment pursuant to section 343-3;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The applicant shall respond in writing to
comments received during the review, and the agency shall prepare a final
environmental assessment to determine whether an environmental impact statement
shall be required.  A statement shall be required if the agency finds that the
proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>              The agency shall file notice of the agency's
determination with the office, which, in turn, shall publish the agency's
determination for the public's information pursuant to section 343-3.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The draft and final statements, if required,
shall be prepared by the applicant, who shall file these statements with the
office.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The draft statement shall be made available for
public review and comment through the office for a period of forty-five days. 
The office shall inform the public of the availability of the draft statement
for public review and comment pursuant to section 343-3.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The applicant shall respond in writing to
comments received during the review and prepare a final statement.  The office,
when requested by the applicant or agency, may make a recommendation as to the
acceptability of the final statement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The authority to accept a final statement shall
rest with the agency initially receiving and agreeing to process the request
for approval.  The final decision-making body or approving agency for the
request for approval is not required to be the accepting authority.  The
planning department for the county in which the proposed action will occur shall
be a permissible accepting authority for the final statement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Acceptance of a required final statement shall
be a condition precedent to approval of the request and commencement of the
proposed action.  Upon acceptance or nonacceptance of the final statement, the
agency shall file notice of such determination with the office.  The office, in
turn, shall publish the determination of acceptance or nonacceptance of the
final statement pursuant to section 343-3.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The agency receiving the request, within thirty
days of receipt of the final statement, shall notify the applicant and the
office of the acceptance or nonacceptance of the final statement.  The final
statement shall be deemed to be accepted if the agency fails to accept or not
accept the final statement within thirty days after receipt of the final
statement; provided that the thirty-day period may be extended at the request
of the applicant for a period not to exceed fifteen days.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In any acceptance or nonacceptance, the agency
shall provide the applicant with the specific findings and reasons for its
determination.  An applicant, within sixty days after nonacceptance of a final
statement by an agency, may appeal the nonacceptance to the environmental
council, which, within thirty days of receipt of the appeal, shall notify the
applicant of the council's determination.  In any affirmation or reversal of an
appealed nonacceptance, the council shall provide the applicant and agency with
specific findings and reasons for its determination.  The agency shall abide by
the council's decision.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Whenever an applicant simultaneously
requests approval for a proposed action from two or more agencies and there is
a question as to which agency has the responsibility of preparing the
environmental assessment, the office, after consultation with the agencies
involved, shall determine which agency shall prepare the assessment.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In preparing an environmental assessment,
an agency may consider and, where applicable and appropriate, incorporate by
reference, in whole or in part, previous determinations of whether a statement
is required and previously accepted statements.  The council, by rule, shall
establish criteria and procedures for the use of previous determinations and
statements.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Whenever an action is subject to both the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-190) and the
requirements of this chapter, the office and agencies shall cooperate with
federal agencies to the fullest extent possible to reduce duplication between
federal and state requirements.  Such cooperation, to the fullest extent
possible, shall include joint environmental impact statements with concurrent
public review and processing at both levels of government.  Where federal law
has environmental impact statement requirements in addition to but not in
conflict with this chapter, the office and agencies shall cooperate in
fulfilling these requirements so that one document shall comply with all
applicable laws.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  A statement that is accepted with respect
to a particular action shall satisfy the requirements of this chapter, and no
other statement for the proposed action shall be required. [L 1974, c 246, pt
of §1; am and ren L 1979, c 197, §1(5) and (6); am L 1980, c 22, §1; am L 1983,

<p class=XNotes>  For Hawaiian home lands, the department of Hawaiian home
lands is the accepting authority for applicant proposals under subsection (c);
because the governor is not involved, there is no conflict with Hawaiian homes
commission act.  87 H. 91, 952 P.2d 379.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;State lands&quot; in subsection (a)(1) includes

whether the proposed action will &quot;likely&quot; have a significant effect
on the environment; as defined in §343-2, &quot;significant effect&quot;
includes irrevocable commitment of natural resources; where the burning of
thousands of gallons of fuel and the withdrawal of millions of gallons of
groundwater on a daily basis would &quot;likely&quot; cause such irrevocable
commitment, an EIS was required pursuant to both the common meaning of
&quot;may&quot; and the statutory definition of &quot;significant
effect&quot;.  106 H. 270, 103 P.3d 939.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where all three elements under subsection (c) were present: 
(1) an applicant proposed an action specified by subsection (a), (2) the action
required the approval of an agency, and (3) the action was not exempt under
§343-6, the land use commission, as the agency that received the request for
approval of the boundary amendment petition, was required by statute to prepare
an environmental assessment of the proposed action at the earliest practical
time.  109 H. 411, 126 P.3d 1098.</p>
