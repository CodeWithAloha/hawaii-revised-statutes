council for the board of regents of the University of Hawaii.  </b>(a)  There
is established the candidate advisory council for the board of regents of the

the remainder of the term of the person's predecessor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  The candidate advisory council shall
operate in a wholly nonpartisan manner.  No individual, while a member of the
candidate advisory council, shall run for or hold any elected office under the United States or the State or any of its political subdivisions.</p>
