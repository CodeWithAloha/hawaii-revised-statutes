obligating the other person to the special facility lease:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To pay to the department during the initial term
of the special facility lease, whether the special facility is capable of being

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  To pay to the department:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  A ground rental, equal to the fair market

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  A properly allocable share of the
administrative costs of the department in carrying out the special facility

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Procure and maintain, or cause to be
procured or maintained, to the extent commercially available, a comprehensive

to paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be paid into the airport revenue fund and shall
not be nor be deemed to be revenues of the special facility.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The term and all renewals and extensions
of the term of any special facility lease (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) shall not extend beyond the lesser of the reasonable life
of the special facility which is the subject of the special facility lease, as
estimated by the department at the time of the entering into thereof, or thirty
years.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Any special facility lease entered into by
the department shall be subject to chapter 171 and shall contain any other
terms and conditions that the department deems advisable to effectuate the
purposes of this part. [L 1971, c 160, pt of §1; am L 1998, c 284, §2]</p>
