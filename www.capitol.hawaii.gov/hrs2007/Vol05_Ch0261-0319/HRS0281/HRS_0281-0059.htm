<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §281-59  Hearing; rehearing.</b>  (a)  Upon
the day of hearing, or any adjournment thereof, the liquor commission shall
consider the application and any protests and objections to the granting
thereof, and hear the parties in interest.  The liquor commission shall accept
all written or oral testimony for or against the application whether the
application is denied, refused, or withdrawn.  Within fifteen days after the
hearing, or within thirty days thereafter if in its discretion the commission
extends the fifteen days to thirty days, and gives public notice of same, the
commission shall give its decision granting or refusing the application;
provided that if a majority of the:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Registered voters for the area within five
hundred feet of the nearest point of the premises for which the license is
asked; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Owners and lessees of record of real estate and
owners of record of shares in a cooperative apartment within five hundred feet
of the nearest point of the premises for which the license is asked;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>have duly filed or caused to be filed their protests
against the granting of the license, or if there appears any other
disqualification under this chapter, the application shall be refused. 
Otherwise, the commission may in its discretion grant or refuse the same.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     For purposes of defining &quot;a majority of
the owners and lessees of record of real estate and owners of record of shares
in a cooperative apartment&quot;, each property counts only once.  A protest
submitted by the majority of the co-owners or the majority of the co-lessees of
a property shall constitute a protest by all the owners or lessees of record of
that property.  Owners or lessees who own more than one property may count each
property.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The liquor commission shall make available
to the applicant and any protester for review before the public hearing, the
protest list of those persons who filed a protest or objection to the
application; provided that the applicant shall not use the protest list to
attempt to influence in any way any protester to withdraw the protest or
objection.  All applicants and protesters may submit corrections, additions,
and subtractions to the master list and the protest list at the public
hearing.  The liquor commission shall rule on proposed corrections, additions,
and subtractions and give reasons for the ruling.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The commission may also, with like
discretion:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Grant a license to one person in preference to
another, without reference to any priority in the order of filing of the
applications; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Of its own motion, or on the suggestion of any
member, or of the investigator take notice of any matter or thing which in the
opinion of a majority of its members would be a sufficient objection to the
granting of a license; but in such case if the objection is one to which the
applicant should be given a reasonable time to answer, a continuance may be
granted in the discretion of the commission;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that in any case where any person affected
by such decision petitions the commission for a rehearing of the application
and on oath alleges facts and grounds for consideration which were not formerly
presented or considered, or any other matter of fact which in the judgment of
the commission seems sufficient to warrant a rehearing, such rehearing may be
granted by the commission in its discretion upon the publication of notice of
rehearing at least seven days before the date of the rehearing.  When a
rehearing is allowed notice shall be given to the applicant and to the
applicant's opponents, by publication or otherwise as the commission shall
direct. [L Sp 1933, c 40, §34; RL 1935, §2603; RL 1945, §7255; RL 1955,
§159-58; am L 1957, c 321, §1(g); HRS §281-59; am L 1972, c 177, §7; am L 1984,

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Based on a plain and unambiguous reading of this section, a
majority of co-owners or co-lessees must register a protest in order for that
property to be counted as one protest vote; thus, even if commission were to
have counted the two protest votes that were disallowed, the two added votes
would not have resulted in a majority vote nullifying the liquor license
application.  111 H. 234, 140 P.3d 1014.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State and county entities, as owners of real property, are
included as owners for both notice and protest purposes as set forth under
§281-57 and this section.  111 H. 234, 140 P.3d 1014.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The State and county governments fall within the definition
of &quot;owner of record&quot; under this section as property owners of real
estate.  111 H. 234, 140 P.3d 1014.</p>
