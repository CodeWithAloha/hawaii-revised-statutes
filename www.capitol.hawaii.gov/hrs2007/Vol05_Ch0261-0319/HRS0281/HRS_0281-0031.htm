<p class=RegularParagraphs>     It shall be unlawful for any holder of a

licensed premises of any other licensee.  This subsection shall not prevent the
holder of a beer class manufacturer's license under this chapter or under the
law of another jurisdiction from maintaining any interest in the license or
licensed premises of a beer and wine class wholesale dealer licensee under this
chapter whose wholesaling is limited to beer, other than direct ownership of a
