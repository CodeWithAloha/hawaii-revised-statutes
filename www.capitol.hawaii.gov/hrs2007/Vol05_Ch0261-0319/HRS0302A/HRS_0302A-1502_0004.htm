return on its investments, price trends, and general economic conditions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  There may be an endowment component of the

liable for the operation or solvency of the fund or Hawaii 3R's.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (p)  For every dollar of state moneys granted
by the fund to the project, there shall be a minimum of $1 in value matched by Hawaii 3R's from private, federal, county, or community service.</p>
