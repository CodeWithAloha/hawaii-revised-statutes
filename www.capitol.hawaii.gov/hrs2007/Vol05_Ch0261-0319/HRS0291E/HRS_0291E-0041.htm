<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§291E-41  Effective date and period of
administrative revocation; criteria.</b>  (a)  Unless an administrative
revocation is reversed or the temporary permit, and temporary motor vehicle
registration and temporary number plates if applicable, are extended by the
director, administrative revocation shall become effective on the day specified
in the notice of administrative revocation.  Except as provided in section
291E-44, no license and privilege to operate a vehicle, nor motor vehicle
registration and number plates if applicable, shall be restored under any
circumstances, and no conditional license permit shall be issued during the
administrative revocation period.  Upon completion of the administrative
revocation period, the respondent may reapply and be reissued a license
pursuant to section 291E-45.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The periods of administrative revocation
with respect to a license and privilege to operate a vehicle, and motor vehicle
registration if applicable, that shall be imposed under this part are as
follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A minimum of three months up to a maximum of one
year revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle, if the
respondent's record shows no prior alcohol enforcement contact or drug
enforcement contact during the five years preceding the date the notice of
administrative revocation was issued;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  For a respondent who is a highly intoxicated
driver, if the respondent's record shows no prior alcohol enforcement contact
or drug enforcement contact during the five years preceding the date the notice
of administrative revocation was issued, a minimum of six months up to a
maximum of one year revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle
and of the registration of any motor vehicle registered to the highly
intoxicated driver; provided that the highly intoxicated driver shall not
qualify for a conditional license permit under section 291E&#8209;44;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A minimum of one year up to a maximum of two
years revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle and of the
registration of any motor vehicle registered to the respondent, if the
respondent's record shows one prior alcohol enforcement contact or drug
enforcement contact during the five years preceding the date the notice of
administrative revocation was issued;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  A minimum of two years up to a maximum of four
years revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle and of the
registration of any motor vehicle registered to the respondent, if the
respondent's record shows two prior alcohol enforcement contacts or drug
enforcement contacts during the seven years preceding the date the notice of
administrative revocation was issued;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Lifetime revocation of license and privilege to
operate a vehicle and of the registration of any motor vehicle registered to
the respondent and a lifetime prohibition on any subsequent registration of
motor vehicles by the respondent, if the respondent's record shows three or
more prior alcohol enforcement contacts or drug enforcement contacts during the
ten years preceding the date the notice of administrative revocation was
issued; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  For respondents under the age of eighteen years
who were arrested for a violation of section 291E&#8209;61 or 291E&#8209;61.5,
revocation of license and privilege to operate a vehicle either for the period
remaining until the respondent's eighteenth birthday or, if applicable, for the
appropriate revocation period provided in paragraphs (1) to (5) or in
subsection (d), whichever is longer and such respondents shall not qualify for
a conditional permit;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that when more than one administrative
revocation, suspension, or conviction arises out of the same arrest, it shall
be counted as only one prior alcohol enforcement contact or drug enforcement
contact, whichever revocation, suspension, or conviction occurs later.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Whenever a motor vehicle registration is
revoked under this part, the director shall cause the revocation to be entered
electronically into the motor vehicle registration file of the respondent.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If a respondent has refused to be tested
after being informed:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  That the person may refuse to submit to testing
in compliance with section 291E-11; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Of the sanctions of this part and then asked if
the person still refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, in
compliance with the requirements of section 291E-15,</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>the revocation imposed under subsection (b)(1), (3),
(4), and (5) shall be for a period of one year, two years, four years, and a
lifetime, respectively.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In addition to subsection (d), any motor
vehicle registration of a respondent who is a repeat intoxicated driver and who
refused to be tested after being informed:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  That the person may refuse to submit to testing
in compliance with section 291E-11; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Of the sanctions of this part and then asked if
the person still refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, in
compliance with the requirements of section 291E-15,</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>shall be revoked for the periods specified in
subsection (d), and the respondent shall be prohibited from subsequently
registering any motor vehicle for the applicable revocation period.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Whenever a license and privilege to
operate a vehicle is administratively revoked under this part, the respondent
shall be referred to the driver's education program for an assessment, by a
certified substance abuse counselor, of the respondent's substance abuse or
dependence and the need for treatment.  The counselor shall submit a report
with recommendations to the director.  If the counselor's assessment
establishes that the extent of the respondent's substance abuse or dependence
warrants treatment, the director shall so order.  All costs for assessment and
treatment shall be paid by the respondent.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Alcohol and drug enforcement contacts that
occurred prior to January 1, 2002, shall be counted in determining the
administrative revocation period.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The requirement to provide proof of
financial responsibility pursuant to section 287-20 shall not be based upon a
revocation under subsection (b)(1). [L 2000, c 189, pt of §23; am L 2001, c
157, §21; am L 2002, c 113, §7; am L 2004, c 90, §11; am L 2006, c 64, §8 and c
201, §5; am L 2007, c 198, §3]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The administrative director of the courts (director) may not,
in an administrative hearing filed pursuant to §291E-38, consider an offense
occurring after the §291E-31 notice of administrative revocation has been
issued, as a basis for increasing an administrative revocation period already
determined on administrative review by the director under §291E-37 and this
section.  108 H. 350, 120 P.3d 249.</p>
