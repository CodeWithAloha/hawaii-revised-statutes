<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§485-13  Revocation of registration of
securities; suspension during investigation; hearing.</b>  (a)  The
commissioner of securities may issue a stop order denying effectiveness to, or
suspending, or revoking the effectiveness of, any registration if the commissioner
finds that the order is in the public interest and that: </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The registration statement as of its effective
date or as of any earlier date in the case of an order denying effectiveness,
or any amendment under section 485-10(f) as of its effective date is incomplete
in any material respect or contains any statement which was, in the light of
the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to
any material fact; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  This chapter or any rule, order, or condition
lawfully imposed under this chapter has been wilfully violated, in connection
with the offering, by (A) the person filing the registration statement, (B) the
issuer, any partner, officer, or director of the issuer, any person occupying a
similar status or performing similar functions, or any person, directly or
indirectly, controlling or controlled by the issuer, but only if the person
filing the registration statement is directly or indirectly controlled by or
acting for the issuer, or (C) any underwriter; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The security registered or sought to be
registered is the subject of an administrative stop order or similar order or a
permanent or temporary injunction of any court of competent jurisdiction
entered under any other federal or state act applicable to the offering; but
(A) the commissioner may not institute a proceeding against an effective
registration statement under this clause more than one year from the date of
the order or injunction relied on, and (B) the commissioner may not enter an
order under this clause on the basis of an order or injunction entered under
any other state act unless that order or injunction was based on facts which
would currently constitute a ground for a stop order under this section; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The issuer's enterprise or method of business
includes or would include activities which are illegal where performed; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The offering has worked or tended to work a fraud
upon purchasers or would so operate; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  The offering has been or would be made with
unreasonable amounts of options, underwriters' and sellers' discounts,
commissions, or other compensation, or promoters' profits or participation; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  When a security is sought to be registered by
notification, it is not eligible for such registration; or </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  The applicant or registrant has failed to pay the
proper filing fee; but the commissioner may enter only a denial order under
this clause and the commissioner shall vacate any such order when the
deficiency has been corrected. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The commissioner may not enter a stop order
against an effective registration statement on the basis of a fact or
transaction known to the commissioner when the registration statement became
effective. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The commissioner may by order summarily
postpone or suspend the effectiveness of the registration statement pending
final determination of any proceeding under this section.  Upon the entry of
the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify each person specified in
subsection (c) that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor and that
within fifteen days after the receipt of a written request the matter will be
set down for hearing.  If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the
commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated
by the commissioner.  If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner,
after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person specified in
subsection (c), may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final
determination. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  No stop order may be entered under any
part of this section except the first sentence of subsection (b) without (1)
appropriate prior notice to the applicant or registrant, the issuer, and the
person on whose behalf the securities are to be or have been offered, (2)
opportunity for hearing, and (3) written findings of fact and conclusions of
law. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The commissioner may vacate or modify a
stop order if the commissioner finds that the conditions which prompted its
entry have changed or that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so. [L
