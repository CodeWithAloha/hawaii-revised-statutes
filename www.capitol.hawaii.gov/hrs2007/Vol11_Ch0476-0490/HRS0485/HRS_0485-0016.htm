<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§485-16  Dealers' and investment advisers'
records and reports; commissioner's powers.</b>  (a)  Except as otherwise
provided in this section, every dealer and investment adviser registered under
this chapter shall make and keep for a period of three years after the close of
the calendar or fiscal year to which they pertain, full and complete records of
the dealer's or investment adviser's business, which records shall be open to
inspection by the commissioner of securities and, in addition, shall file with the
commissioner annual or special reports of the condition, financial or other, of
the dealer or investment adviser, in the form and detail, that the commissioner
shall require.  For the purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplication of
inspections and examinations, the commissioner may cooperate with the
securities administrators of other states, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and any national securities exchange or national securities
association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  If any
dealer or investment adviser fails or refuses to make or keep any record or to
file any report, the commissioner may subpoena the dealer, investment adviser,
or any person having knowledge of the dealer's or investment adviser's affairs
to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence, administer oaths, and
examine the dealer, or investment adviser, or any person under oath with
respect to the affairs of the dealer or investment adviser.  The subpoena shall
have the same force and effect and shall be served in the same manner as if
issued from a court of record.  Witness fees and mileage claims shall be
allowed the same as for testimony in a court of record.  Witness fees, mileage,
and actual expenses necessarily incurred in securing the attendance of
witnesses and of testimony and the production of documents shall constitute a
charge against the dealer or investment adviser, recoverable by action by the
State for the use of the persons entitled thereto.  If any individual fails to
obey the subpoena or obeys the subpoena and refuses to testify when required
concerning the matter under investigation, the commissioner shall file the
commissioner's written report thereof and proof of service of the
commissioner's subpoena in the circuit court for the circuit in which the
examination is being conducted.  Thereupon, the court shall forthwith cause the
individual to be brought before it to show cause why the individual should not
be held in contempt; and if so held, may punish the individual as if the failure
or refusal related to a subpoena from or testimony in that court.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  This section shall not apply to any dealer
that is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to an
investment adviser that maintains its principal place of business in a state
other than this State; provided the investment adviser is registered in the
state where it maintains its principal place of business and is in compliance
with that state's recordkeeping requirements, if any.  The commissioner may
require:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The filing of any financial or operational report
that is required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or under
the laws of the state where an investment adviser maintains its principal place
of business; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The production of any document, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in subsection (a), required to be maintained by a
dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or by the state in
which an investment adviser maintains its principal place of business. [L 1963,
