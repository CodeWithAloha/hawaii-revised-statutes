<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </b>None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Subsection (1)(c):  &quot;Banking Day&quot;.  Under this
definition that part of a business day when a bank is open only for limited
functions, e.g., on Saturday evenings to receive deposits and cash checks, but
with loan, bookkeeping and other departments closed, is not part of a banking
day.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Subsection (1)(d):  &quot;Clearing House&quot;. 
Occasionally express companies, governmental agencies and other non-banks deal
directly with a clearing house; hence the definition does not limit the term to
an association of banks.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Subsection (1)(e):  &quot;Customer&quot;.  It is to be
noted that this term includes a bank carrying an account with another bank as
well as the more typical non-bank customer or depositor.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Subsection (1)(g):  The word &quot;item&quot; is chosen
because it is &quot;banking language&quot; and includes non-negotiable as well
as negotiable paper calling for money and also similar paper governed by the
Article on Investment Securities (Article 8) as well as that governed by the
Article on Commercial Paper (Article 3).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Subsection (1)(h):  &quot;Midnight Deadline&quot;.  The
use of this phrase is an example of the more mechanical approach used in this
Article.  Midnight is selected as a termination point or time limit to obtain
greater uniformity and definiteness than would be possible from other possible
termination points, such as the close of the banking day or business day.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Subsection (1)(j):  The term &quot;settle&quot; is a new
term in bank collection language that has substantial importance throughout
Article 4.  In the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code, in
deferred posting statutes, in Federal Reserve regulations and operating
letters, in clearing house rules, in agreements between banks and customers and
in legends on deposit tickets and collection letters, there is repeated
reference to &quot;conditional&quot; or &quot;provisional&quot; credits or payments. 
Tied in with this concept of credits or payments being in some way tentative,
has been a related but somewhat different problem as to when an item is
&quot;paid&quot; or &quot;finally paid&quot; either to determine the relative
priority of the item as against attachments, stop payment orders and the like
or in insolvency situations.  There has been extensive litigation in the
various states on these problems.  To a substantial extent the confusion, the
litigation and even the resulting court decisions fail to take into account
that in the collection process some debits or credits are provisional or
tentative and others are final and that very many debits or credits are
provisional or tentative for awhile but later become final.  Similarly, some
cases fail to recognize that within a single bank, particularly a payor bank,
each item goes through a series of processes and that in a payor bank most of
these processes are preliminary to the basic act of payment or &quot;final
payment&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The term &quot;settle&quot; is used as a convenient term to
characterize a broad variety of conditional, provisional, tentative and also
final payments of items.  Such a comprehensive term is needed because it is
frequently difficult or unnecessary to determine whether a particular action is
tentative or final or when a particular credit shifts from the tentative class
to the final class.  Therefore, its use throughout the Article indicates that
in that particular context it is unnecessary or unwise to determine whether the
debit or the credit or the payment is tentative or final.  However, when
qualified by the adjective &quot;provisional&quot; its tentative nature is
intended, and when qualified by the adjective &quot;final&quot; its permanent
nature is intended.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Examples of the various types of settlement contemplated by
the term include payments in cash; the efficient but somewhat complicated
process of payment through the adjustment and offsetting of balances through
clearing houses; debit or credit entries in accounts between banks; the
forwarding of various types of remittance instruments, sometimes to cover a
particular item but more frequently to cover an entire group of items received
on a particular day.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Subsection (1)(k):  &quot;Suspends payments&quot;.  This
term is designed to afford an objective test to determine when a bank is no
longer operating as a part of the banking system.</p>
