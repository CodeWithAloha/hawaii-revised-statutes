<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:4-405  Death or incompetence of
customer.  </b>(a)  A payor or collecting bank's authority to accept, pay, or
collect an item or to account for proceeds of its collection, if otherwise
effective, is not rendered ineffective by incompetence of a customer of either
bank existing at the time the item is issued or its collection is undertaken if
the bank does not know of an adjudication of incompetence.  Neither death nor
incompetence of a customer revokes the authority to accept, pay, collect, or
account until the bank knows of the fact of death or of an adjudication of
incompetence and has reasonable opportunity to act on it.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Even with knowledge, a bank may for ten
days after the date of death pay or certify checks drawn on or before that date
unless ordered to stop payment by a person claiming an interest in the account.

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: </b> None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  This section is new, although similar statutory
provisions are in existence in seven states.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Subsection (1) follows existing decisions which hold that
a drawee (payor) bank is not liable for the payment of a check before it has
notice of the death or incompetence of the drawer.  The justice and necessity
of the rule are obvious.  A check is an order to pay which the bank must obey
under penalty of possible liability for dishonor.  Further, with the tremendous
volume of items handled any rule which required banks to verify the continued
life and competency of drawers would be completely unworkable.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  One or both of these same reasons apply to other phases of
the bank collection and payment process and the rule is made wide enough to
apply to these other phases.  It applies to all kinds of &quot;items&quot;; to
&quot;customers&quot; who own items as well as &quot;customers&quot; who draw
or make them; to the function of collecting items as well as the function of
accepting or paying them; to the carrying out of instructions to account for
proceeds even though these may involve transfers to third parties; to
depositary and intermediary banks as well as payor banks; and to incompetency
existing at the time of the issuance of an item or the commencement of the
collection or payment process as well as to incompetency occurring thereafter. 
Further, the requirement of actual knowledge makes inapplicable the rule of
some cases that an adjudication of incompetency is constructive notice to all
the world because obviously it is as impossible for banks to keep posted on such
adjudications (in the absence of actual knowledge) as it is to keep posted as
to death of immediate or remote customers.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Subsection (2) provides a limited period after death
during which a bank may continue to pay checks (as distinguished from other
items) even though it has notice.  The purpose of the provision, as of the
existing statutes, is to permit holders of checks drawn and issued shortly
before death to cash them without the necessity of filing a claim in probate. 
The justification is that such checks normally are given in immediate payment
of an obligation, that there is almost never any reason why they should not be
paid, and that filing in probate is a useless formality, burdensome to the
holder, the executor, the court and the bank.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section does not prevent an executor or administrator
from recovering the payment from the holder of the check.  It is not intended
to affect the validity of any gift causa mortis or other transfer in
contemplation of death, but merely to relieve the bank of liability for the
payment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Any surviving relative, creditor or other person who
claims an interest in the account may give a direction to the bank not to pay
checks, or not to pay a particular check.  Such notice has the same effect as a
direction to stop payment.  The bank has no responsibility to determine the
validity of the claim or even whether it is &quot;colorable&quot;.  But
obviously anyone who has an interest in the estate, including the person named
as executor in a will, even if the will has not yet been admitted to probate,
is entitled to claim an interest in the account.</p>
