<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-513  Buyer's right to inspection of
goods.</b>  (1)  Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3), where
goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the
buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any
reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner.  When the seller is
required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be
after their arrival.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Expenses of inspection must be borne by
the buyer but may be recovered from the seller if the goods do not conform and
are rejected.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the
provisions of this Article on C.I.F. contracts (subsection (3) of section
490:2-321), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goods before payment of
the price when the contract provides</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   For delivery &quot;C.O.D.&quot; or on other like
terms; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   For payment against documents of title, except
where such payment is due only after the goods are to become available for
inspection.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  A place or method of inspection fixed by
the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwise expressly agreed
it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for
passing the risk of loss.  If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall
be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly
intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the contract. [L
1965, c 208, §2-513; HRS §490:2-513]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 47(2), (3), Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten, Subsections (2) and (3) being
new.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b>
<b>Matter:</b>  To correspond in substance with the prior uniform statutory
provision and to incorporate in addition some of the results of the better case
law so that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The buyer is entitled to inspect goods as provided in
subsection (1) unless it has been otherwise agreed by the parties.  The phrase
&quot;unless otherwise agreed&quot; is intended principally to cover such
situations as those outlined in subsections (3) and (4) and those in which the
agreement of the parties negates inspection before tender of delivery. 
However, no agreement by the parties can displace the entire right of
inspection except where the contract is simply for the sale of &quot;this
thing.&quot;  Even in a sale of boxed goods &quot;as is&quot; inspection is a
right of the buyer, since if the boxes prove to contain some other merchandise
altogether the price can be recovered back; nor do the limitations of the
provision on effect of acceptance apply in such a case.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The buyer's right of inspection is available to him upon
tender, delivery or appropriation of the goods with notice to him.  Since
inspection is available to him on tender, where payment is due against delivery
he may, unless otherwise agreed, make his inspection before payment of the
price.  It is also available to him after receipt of the goods and so may be
postponed after receipt for a reasonable time.  Failure to inspect before
payment does not impair the right to inspect after receipt of the goods unless
the case falls within subsection (4) on agreed and exclusive inspection
provisions.  The right to inspect goods which have been appropriated with
notice to the buyer holds whether or not the sale was by sample.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The buyer may exercise his right of inspection at any
reasonable time or place and in any reasonable manner.  It is not necessary
that he select the most appropriate time, place or manner to inspect or that
his selection be the customary one in the trade or locality.  Any reasonable
time, place or manner is available to him and the reasonableness will be
determined by trade usages, past practices between the parties and the other
circumstances of the case.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The last sentence of subsection (1) makes it clear that the
place of arrival of shipped goods is a reasonable place for their inspection.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Expenses of an inspection made to satisfy the buyer of
the seller's performance must be assumed by the buyer in the first instance. 
Since the rule provides merely for an allocation of expense there is no policy
to prevent the parties from providing otherwise in the agreement.  Where the
buyer would normally bear the expenses of the inspection but the goods are
rightly rejected because of what the inspection reveals, demonstrable and
reasonable costs of the inspection are part of his incidental damage caused by
the seller's breach.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  In the case of payment against documents, subsection (3)
requires payment before inspection, since shipping documents against which
payment is to be made will commonly arrive and be tendered while the goods are
still in transit.  This Article recognizes no exception in any peculiar case in
which the goods happen to arrive before the documents.  However, where by the
agreement payment is to await the arrival of the goods, inspection before
payment becomes proper since the goods are then &quot;available for
inspection.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where by the agreement the documents are to be held until
arrival the buyer is entitled to inspect before payment since the goods are
then &quot;available for inspection&quot;.  Proof of usage is not necessary to
establish this right, but if inspection before payment is disputed the contrary
must be established by usage or by an explicit contract term to that effect.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  For the same reason, that the goods are available for
inspection, a term calling for payment against storage documents or a delivery
order does not normally bar the buyer's right to inspection before payment
under subsection (3)(b).  This result is reinforced by the buyer's right under
subsection (1) to inspect goods which have been appropriated with notice to
him.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Under subsection (4) an agreed place or method of
inspection is generally held to be intended as exclusive.  However, where
compliance with such an agreed inspection term becomes impossible, the question
is basically one of intention.  If the parties clearly intend that the method
of inspection named is to be a necessary condition without which the entire
deal is to fail, the contract is at an end if that method becomes impossible. 
On the other hand, if the parties merely seek to indicate a convenient and
reliable method but do not intend to give up the deal in the event of its
failure, any reasonable method of inspection may be substituted under this
Article.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Since the purpose of an agreed place of inspection is only to
make sure at that point whether or not the goods will be thrown back, the
&quot;exclusive&quot; feature of the named place is satisfied under this
Article if the buyer's failure to inspect there is held to be an acceptance
with the knowledge of such defects as inspection would have revealed within the
section on waiver of buyer's objections by failure to particularize. 
Revocation of the acceptance is limited to the situations stated in the section
pertaining to that subject.  The reasonable time within which to give notice of
defects within the section on notice of breach begins to run from the point of
the &quot;acceptance.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Clauses on time of inspection are commonly clauses which
limit the time in which the buyer must inspect and give notice of defects. 
Such clauses are therefore governed by the section of this Article which
requires that such a time limitation must be reasonable.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  8.  Inspection under this Article is not to be regarded as a
&quot;condition precedent to the passing of title&quot; so that risk until
inspection remains on the seller.  Under subsection (4) such an approach cannot
be sustained.  Issues between the buyer and seller are settled in this Article
almost wholly by special provisions and not by the technical determination of
the locus of the title.  Thus &quot;inspection as a condition to the passing of
title&quot; becomes a concept almost without meaning.  However, in peculiar
circumstances inspection may still have some of the consequences hitherto
sought and obtained under that concept.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  9.  &quot;Inspection&quot; under this section has to do with
the buyer's check-up on whether the seller's performance is in accordance with
a contract previously made and is not to be confused with the &quot;examination&quot;
of the goods or of a sample or model of them at the time of contracting which
may affect the warranties involved in the contract.</p>
