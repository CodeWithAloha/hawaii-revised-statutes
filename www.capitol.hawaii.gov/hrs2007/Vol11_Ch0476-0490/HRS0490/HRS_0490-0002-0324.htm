§490:2-324]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The &quot;no arrival, no sale&quot; term in a &quot;destination&quot;
overseas contract leaves risk of loss on the seller but gives him an exemption
from liability for non-delivery.  Both the nature of the case and the duty of
good faith require that the seller must not interfere with the arrival of the
goods in any way.  If the circumstances impose upon him the responsibility for
making or arranging the shipment, he must have a shipment made despite the
exemption clause.  Further, the shipment made must be a conforming one, for the
exemption under a &quot;no arrival, no sale&quot; term applies only to the
hazards of transportation and the goods must be proper in all other respects.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The reason of this section is that where the seller is
reselling goods bought by him as shipped by another and this fact is known to
the buyer, so that the seller is not under any obligation to make the shipment
himself, the seller is entitled under the &quot;no arrival, no sale&quot;
clause to exemption from payment of damages for non-delivery if the goods do
not arrive or if the goods which actually arrive are non-conforming.  This does
not extend to sellers who arrange shipment by their own agents, in which case
the clause is limited to casualty due to marine hazards.  But sellers who make
known that they are contracting only with respect to what will be delivered to
them by parties over whom they assume no control are entitled to the full
quantum of the exemption.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The provisions of this Article on identification must be
read together with the present section in order to bring the exemption into application. 
Until there is some designation of the goods in a particular shipment or on a
particular ship as being those to which the contract refers there can be no
application of an exemption for their non-arrival.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The seller's duty to tender the agreed or declared goods
if they do arrive is not impaired because of their delay in arrival or by their
arrival after transshipment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  The phrase &quot;to arrive&quot; is often employed in the
same sense as &quot;no arrival, no sale&quot; and may then be given the same
effect.  But a &quot;to arrive&quot; term, added to a C.I.F. or C. &amp; F.
contract, does not have the full meaning given by this section to &quot;no
arrival, no sale&quot;.  Such a &quot;to arrive&quot; term is usually intended
to operate only to the extent that the risks are not covered by the agreed
insurance and the loss or casualty is due to such uncovered hazards.  In some
instances the &quot;to arrive&quot; term may be regarded as a time of payment
term, or, in the case of the reselling seller discussed in point 1 above, as
negating responsibility for conformity of the goods, if they arrive, to any
description which was based on his good faith belief of the quality.  Whether
this is the intention of the parties is a question of fact based on all the
circumstances surrounding the resale and in case of ambiguity the rules of
Sections 2-316 and 2-317 apply to preclude dishonor.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Paragraph (b) applies where goods arrive impaired by
damage or partial loss during transportation and makes the policy of this
Article on casualty to identified goods applicable to such a situation.  For
the term cannot be regarded as intending to give the seller an unforeseen
profit through casualty; it is intended only to protect him from loss due to
causes beyond his control.</p>
