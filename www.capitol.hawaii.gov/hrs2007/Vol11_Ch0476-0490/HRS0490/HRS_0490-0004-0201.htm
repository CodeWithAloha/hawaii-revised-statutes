COLLECTION OF ITEMS:</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:4-201  Status of collecting bank as
agent and provisional status of credits; applicability of Article; item
indorsed &quot;pay any bank.&quot;</b>  (a)  Unless a contrary intent clearly
appears and before the time that a settlement given by a collecting bank for an
item is or becomes final, the bank, with respect to the item, is an agent or
subagent of the owner of the item and any settlement given for the item is
provisional.  This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or
lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to
immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn; but the continuance
of ownership of an item by its owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of
the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as those resulting
from outstanding advances on the item and rights of recoupment or setoff.  If
an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection,
or return, the relevant provisions of this Article apply even though action of
the parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item
and is the owner of it.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  After an item has been indorsed with the
words &quot;pay any bank&quot; or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights
of a holder until the item has been:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Returned to the customer initiating collection;
or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Specially indorsed by a bank to a person who is
not a bank. [L 1965, c 208, §4-201; HRS §490:4-201; am L 1991, c 118, pt of §4]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  None; but see
Sections 2 and 4 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  This section states certain basic rules and presumptions
of the bank collection process.  One basic rule, appearing in the last sentence
of subsection (1), is that, to the extent applicable, the provisions of the
Article govern without regard to whether a bank handling an item owns the item
or is an agent for collection.  Historically, much time has been spent and
effort expended in determining or attempting to determine whether a bank was a
purchaser of an item or merely an agent for collection.  See discussion of this
subject and cases cited in 11 A.L.R. 1043, 16 A.L.R. 1084, 42 A.L.R. 92, 68
A.L.R. 725, 99 A.L.R. 486.  See also Section 4 of the American Bankers
Association Bank Collection Code.  The general approach of Article 4, similar
to that of other articles, is to provide, within reasonable limits, rules or
answers to major problems known to exist in the bank collection process without
regard to questions of status and ownership but to keep general principles such
as status and ownership available to cover residual areas not covered by
specific rules.  In line with this approach, the last sentence of subsection
(1) says in effect that Article 4 applies to practically every item moving
through banks for the purpose of presentment, payment or collection.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Within this general rule of broad coverage, the first two
sentences of subsection (1) state a rule of status in terms of a strong
presumption.  &quot;Unless a contrary intent clearly appears&quot; the status
of a collecting bank is that of an agent or sub-agent for the owner of the
item.  Although as indicated in Comment 1 it is much less important under
Article 4 to determine status than has been the case heretofore, such status
may have importance in some residual areas not covered by specific rules. 
Further, where status has been considered so important in the past, to omit all
reference to it might cause confusion.  The presumption of agency &quot;applies
regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though
credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is
in fact withdrawn&quot;.  Thus questions heretofore litigated as to whether
ordinary indorsements &quot;for deposit&quot;, &quot;for collection&quot; or in
blank have the effect of creating an agency status or a purchase, no longer
have significance in varying the prima facie rule of agency.  Similarly, the nature
of the credit given for an item or whether it is subject to immediate
withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn, do not rebut the general
presumption.  See A.L.R. references supra in Comment 1.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A contrary intent can rebut the presumption but this must be
clear.  An example of a clear contrary intent would be if collateral papers
established or the item bore a legend stating that the item was sold absolutely
to the depositary bank.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The prima facie agency status of collecting banks is consistent
with prevailing law and practice today.  Section 2 of the American Bankers
Association Bank Collection Code so provides.  Legends on deposit tickets,
collection letters and acknowledgments of items and Federal Reserve operating
letters consistently so provide.  The status is consistent with rights of
chargeback (Section 4-212 and Section 11 of the ABA Code) and risk of loss in
the event of insolvency (Section 4-214 and Section 13 of the ABA Code).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Affirmative statement of a prima facie agency status for
collecting banks requires certain limitations and qualifications.  Under
current practices substantially all bank collections sooner or later merge into
bank credits, at least if collection is effected.  Usually, this takes place
within a few days of the initiation of collection.  An intermediary bank
receives final collection and evidences the result of its collection by a
&quot;credit&quot; on its books to the depositary bank.  The depositary bank
evidences the results of its collection by a &quot;credit&quot; in the account
of its customer.  As used in these instances the term &quot;credit&quot;
clearly indicates a debtor-creditor relationship.  At some stage in the bank
collection process the agency status of a collecting bank changes to that of
debtor, a debtor of its customer.  Usually at about the same time it also
becomes a creditor for the amount of the item, a creditor of some intermediary,
payor or other bank.  Thus the collection is completed, all agency aspects are
terminated and the identity of the item has become completely merged in bank
accounts, that of the customer with the depositary bank and that of one bank
with another.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although Section 4-213(1) provides that an item is finally
paid when the payor bank takes certain action with respect to the item such final
payment of the item may or may not result in the simultaneous final settlement
for the item in the case of all prior parties.  If a series of provisional
debits and credits for the item have been entered in accounts between banks,
the final payment of the item by the payor bank may result in the automatic
firming up of all these provisional debits and credits under Section 4-213(2),
and the consequent receipt of final settlement for the item by each collecting
bank and the customer of the depositary bank simultaneously with such action of
the payor bank.  However, if the payor bank or some intermediary bank accounts
for the item with a remittance draft, the next prior bank usually does not
receive final settlement for the item until such remittance draft finally
clears.  See Section 4-211(3)(a).  The first sentence of subsection (1)
provides that the agency status of a collecting bank (whether intermediary or
depositary) continues until the settlement given by it for the item is or
becomes final, referring to Sections 4-211(3), 4-212, and 4-213.  In the case
of the series of provisional credits covered by Section 4-213(2), this could be
simultaneously with the final payment of the item by the payor bank.  In cases
where remittance drafts are used or in straight non-cash collections, this
would not be until the times specified in Sections 4-211(3) and 4-213(3).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A number of practical results flow from this rule continuing
the agency status of a collecting bank until its settlement for the item is or
becomes final, some of which are specifically set forth in this Article.  One
is that risk of loss continues in the owner of the item rather than the agent
bank.  See Section 4-212.  Offsetting rights favorable to the owner are that
pending such final settlement, the owner has the preference rights of Section
4-214 and the direct rights of Section 4-302 against the payor bank.  It also
follows from this rule that the dollar limitations of Federal Deposit Insurance
are measured by the claim of the owner of the item rather than that of the
collecting bank.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  In those cases where some period of time elapses between
the final payment of the item by the payor bank and the time that the
settlement of the collecting bank is or becomes final, e.g., where the payor
bank or an intermediary bank accounts for the item with a remittance draft or
in straight non-cash collections, the continuance of the agency status of the
collecting bank necessarily carries with it the continuance of the owner's
status as principal.  The second sentence of subsection (1) provides that
whatever rights the owner has to proceeds of the item are subject to the rights
of collecting banks for outstanding advances on the item and other valid
rights, if any.  The rule provides a sound rule to govern cases of attempted
attachment of proceeds of a non-cash item in the hands of the payor bank as
property of the absent owner.  If a collecting bank has made an advance on an
item which is still outstanding, its right to obtain reimbursement for this
advance should be superior to the rights of the owner to the proceeds or to the
rights of a credit of the owner.  The phrase &quot;other valid rights, if
any&quot; is broad enough to cover legitimate rights of set-off of accounts
between banks without attempting to provide that all set-offs may be valid.  An
intentional crediting of proceeds of an item to the account of a prior bank
known to be insolvent, for the purpose of acquiring a right of set-off, would
not produce a valid set-off.  See 8 Zollman, Banks and Banking (1936) §5443.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  This section and Article 4 as a whole represent an
intentional abandonment of the approach to bank collection problems appearing
in Section 4 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.  Where
the tremendous volume of items handled makes impossible the examination by all
banks of all indorsements on all items and where in fact this examination is
not made, except perhaps by depositary banks, it is unrealistic to base the
rights and duties of all banks in the collection chain on variations in the
form of indorsements.  It is anomalous to provide throughout the ABA Code that
the prima facie status of collecting banks is that of agent or sub-agent but in
Section 4 to provide that subsequent holders (sub-agents) shall have the right
to rely on the presumption that the bank of deposit (the primary agent) is the
owner of the item.  It is unrealistic, particularly in this background, to base
rights and duties on status of agent or owner.  This Section 4-201 makes the
pertinent provisions of Article 4 applicable to substantially all items handled
by banks for presentment, payment or collection, recognizes the prima facie
status of most banks as agents, and then seeks to state appropriate limits and
some attributes to the general rules and presumptions so expressed.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Subsection (2) protects the ownership rights with respect
to an item indorsed &quot;pay any bank or banker&quot; or in similar terms of a
customer initiating collection or of any bank acquiring a security interest
under Section 4-208, in the event the item is subsequently acquired under
improper circumstances by a person who is not a bank and transferred by that
person to another person, whether or not a bank.  Upon return to the customer
initiating collection of an item so indorsed, the indorsement may be cancelled
(Section 3-208).  A bank holding an item so indorsed may transfer the item out
of banking channels by special indorsement; however, under Section 4-103(5),
such bank would be liable to the owner of the item for any loss resulting
therefrom if the transfer had been made in bad faith or with lack of ordinary
care.  If briefer and more simple forms of bank indorsements are developed
under Section 4-206 (e.g., the use of bank transit numbers in lieu of present
lengthy forms of bank indorsements), a depositary bank having the transit
number &quot;X100&quot; could make subsection (2) operative by indorsements
such as &quot;Pay any bank - X100&quot;.</p>
