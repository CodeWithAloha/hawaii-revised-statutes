<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-316  Exclusion or modification of
warranties.</b>  (1)  Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express
warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be
construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the
provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 490:2-202)
negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is
unreasonable.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or
modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language
must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and
to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a
writing and conspicuous.  Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness
is sufficient if it states, for example, that &quot;There are no warranties
which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.&quot;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Notwithstanding subsection (2)</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied
warranties are excluded by expressions like &quot;as is&quot;, &quot;with all
faults&quot; or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's
attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no
implied warranty;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   When the buyer before entering into the contract
has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has
refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to
defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to
him; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   An implied warranty can also be excluded or
modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  Remedies for breach of warranty can be
limited in accordance with the provisions of this Article on liquidation or
limitation of damages and on contractual modification of remedy (sections
490:2-718 and 490:2-719). [L 1965, c 208, §2-316; HRS §490:2-316]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  This section is designed principally to deal with those
frequent clauses in sales contracts which seek to exclude &quot;all warranties,
express or implied.&quot;  It seeks to protect a buyer from unexpected and
unbargained language of disclaimer by denying effect to such language when
inconsistent with language of express warranty and permitting the exclusion of
implied warranties only by conspicuous language or other circumstances which
protect the buyer from surprise.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The seller is protected under this Article against false
allegations of oral warranties by its provisions on parol and extrinsic
evidence and against unauthorized representations by the customary &quot;lack
of authority&quot; clauses.  This Article treats the limitation or avoidance of
consequential damages as a matter of limiting remedies for breach, separate
from the matter of creation of liability under a warranty.  If no warranty
exists, there is of course no problem of limiting remedies for breach of
warranty.  Under subsection (4) the question of limitation of remedy is governed
by the sections referred to rather than by this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability is
permitted under subsection (2), but with the safeguard that such disclaimers
must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Unlike the implied warranty of merchantability, implied
warranties of fitness for a particular purpose may be excluded by general
language, but only if it is in writing and conspicuous.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Subsection (2) presupposes that the implied warranty in
question exists unless excluded or modified.  Whether or not language of
disclaimer satisfies the requirements of this section, such language may be
relevant under other sections to the question whether the warranty was ever in
fact created.  Thus, unless the provisions of this Article on parol and
extrinsic evidence prevent, oral language of disclaimer may raise issues of
fact as to whether reliance by the buyer occurred and whether the seller had
&quot;reason to know&quot; under the section on implied warranty of fitness for
a particular purpose.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  The exceptions to the general rule set forth in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (3) are common factual situations in
which the circumstances surrounding the transaction are in themselves sufficient
to call the buyer's attention to the fact that no implied warranties are made
or that a certain implied warranty is being excluded.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Paragraph (a) of subsection (3) deals with general terms
such as &quot;as is,&quot; &quot;as they stand,&quot; &quot;with all
faults,&quot; and the like.  Such terms in ordinary commercial usage are
understood to mean that the buyer takes the entire risk as to the quality of
the goods involved.  The terms covered by paragraph (a) are in fact merely a
particularization of paragraph (c) which provides for exclusion or modification
of implied warranties by usage of trade.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  8.  Under paragraph (b) of subsection (3) warranties may be
excluded or modified by the circumstances where the buyer examines the goods or
a sample or model of them before entering into the contract. 
&quot;Examination&quot; as used in this paragraph is not synonymous with
inspection before acceptance or at any other time after the contract has been
made.  It goes rather to the nature of the responsibility assumed by the seller
at the time of the making of the contract.  Of course if the buyer discovers
the defect and uses the goods anyway, or if he unreasonably fails to examine
the goods before he uses them, resulting injuries may be found to result from
his own action rather than proximately from a breach of warranty.  See Sections
2-314 and 2-715 and comments thereto.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In order to bring the transaction within the scope of
&quot;refused to examine&quot; in paragraph (b), it is not sufficient that the
goods are available for inspection.  There must in addition be a demand by the
seller that the buyer examine the goods fully.  The seller by the demand puts
the buyer on notice that he is assuming the risk of defects which the
examination ought to reveal.  The language &quot;refused to examine&quot; in
this paragraph is intended to make clear the necessity for such demand.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Application of the doctrine of &quot;caveat emptor&quot; in
all cases where the buyer examines the goods regardless of statements made by
the seller is, however, rejected by this Article.  Thus, if the offer of
examination is accompanied by words as to their merchantability or specific
attributes and the buyer indicates clearly that he is relying on those words
rather than on his examination, they give rise to an &quot;express&quot;
warranty.  In such cases the question is one of fact as to whether a warranty
of merchantability has been expressly incorporated in the agreement. 
Disclaimer of such an express warranty is governed by subsection (1) of the
present section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The particular buyer's skill and the normal method of
examining goods in the circumstances determine what defects are excluded by the
examination.  A failure to notice defects which are obvious cannot excuse the
buyer.  However, an examination under circumstances which do not permit
chemical or other testing of the goods would not exclude defects which could be
ascertained only by such testing.  Nor can latent defects be excluded by a
simple examination.  A professional buyer examining a product in his field will
be held to have assumed the risk as to all defects which a professional in the
field ought to observe, while a nonprofessional buyer will be held to have
assumed the risk only for such defects as a layman might be expected to
observe.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  9.  The situation in which the buyer gives precise and
complete specifications to the seller is not explicitly covered in this
section, but this is a frequent circumstance by which the implied warranties
may be excluded.  The warranty of fitness for a particular purpose would not
normally arise since in such a situation there is usually no reliance on the
seller by the buyer.  The warranty of merchantability in such a transaction,
however, must be considered in connection with the next section on the
cumulation and conflict of warranties.  Under paragraph (c) of that section in
case of such an inconsistency the implied warranty of merchantability is
displaced by the express warranty that the goods will comply with the
specifications.  Thus, where the buyer gives detailed specifications as to the
goods, neither of the implied warranties as to quality will normally apply to
the transaction unless consistent with the specifications.</p>
