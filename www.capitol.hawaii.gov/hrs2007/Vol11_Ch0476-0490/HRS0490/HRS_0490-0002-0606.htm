<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-606  What constitutes acceptance of
goods.</b>  (1)  Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   After a reasonable opportunity to inspect the
goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that he will
take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Fails to make an effective rejection (subsection
(1) of section 490:2-602), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyer
has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   Does any act inconsistent with the seller's
ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an
acceptance only if ratified by him.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Acceptance of a part of any commercial
unit is acceptance of that entire unit. [L 1965, c 208, §2-606; HRS §490:2-606]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 48, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten, the qualification in paragraph
(c) and subsection (2) being new; otherwise the general policy of the prior
legislation is continued.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b>
<b>Matter:</b>  To make it clear that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Under this Article &quot;acceptance&quot; as applied to
goods means that the buyer, pursuant to the contract, takes particular goods
which have been appropriated to the contract as his own, whether or not he is
obligated to do so, and whether he does so by words, action, or silence when it
is time to speak.  If the goods conform to the contract, acceptance amounts
only to the performance by the buyer of one part of his legal obligation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Under this Article acceptance of goods is always
acceptance of identified goods which have been appropriated to the contract or
are appropriated by the contract.  There is no provision for &quot;acceptance
of title&quot; apart from acceptance in general, since acceptance of title is not
material under this Article to the detailed rights and duties of the parties. 
(See Section 2-401).  The refinements of the older law between acceptance of
goods and of title become unnecessary in view of the provisions of the sections
on effect and revocation of acceptance, on effects of identification and on
risk of loss, and those sections which free the seller's and buyer's remedies
from the complications and confusions caused by the question of whether title
has or has not passed to the buyer before breach.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Under paragraph (a), payment made after tender is always
one circumstance tending to signify acceptance of the goods but in itself it
can never be more than one circumstance and is not conclusive.  Also, a
conditional communication of acceptance always remains subject to its expressed
conditions.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Under paragraph (c), any action taken by the buyer, which
is inconsistent with his claim that he has rejected the goods, constitutes an
acceptance.  However, the provisions of paragraph (c) are subject to the
sections dealing with rejection by the buyer which permit the buyer to take
certain actions with respect to the goods pursuant to his options and duties
imposed by those sections, without effecting an acceptance of the goods.  The
second clause of paragraph (c) modifies some of the prior case law and makes it
clear that &quot;acceptance&quot; in law based on the wrongful act of the
acceptor is acceptance only as against the wrongdoer and then only at the
option of the party wronged.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In the same manner in which a buyer can bind himself, despite
his insistence that he is rejecting or has rejected the goods, by an act
inconsistent with the seller's ownership under paragraph (c), he can obligate
himself by a communication of acceptance despite a prior rejection under
paragraph (a).  However, the sections on buyer's rights on improper delivery
and on the effect of rightful rejection, make it clear that after he once
rejects a tender, paragraph (a) does not operate in favor of the buyer unless
the seller has re-tendered the goods or has taken affirmative action indicating
that he is holding the tender open.  See also Comment 2 to Section 2-601.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Subsection (2) supplements the policy of the section on
buyer's rights on improper delivery, recognizing the validity of a partial
acceptance but insisting that the buyer exercise this right only as to whole
commercial units.</p>
