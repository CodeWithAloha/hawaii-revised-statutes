<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The present section rests upon a policy of permitting the
buyer to give a quick and informal notice of defects in a tender without
penalizing him for omissions in his statement, while at the same time
protecting a seller who is reasonably misled by the buyer's failure to state
curable defects.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Where the defect in a tender is one which could have been
cured by the seller, a buyer who merely rejects the delivery without stating
his objections to it is probably acting in commercial bad faith and seeking to
get out of a deal which has become unprofitable.  Subsection (1)(a), following
the general policy of this Article which looks to preserving the deal wherever
possible, therefore insists that the seller's rights to correct his tender in
such circumstances be protected.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  When the time for cure is past, subsection (1)(b) makes
it plain that a seller is entitled upon request to a final statement of
objections upon which he can rely.  What is needed is that he make clear to the
buyer exactly what is being sought.  A formal demand under paragraph (b) will
be sufficient in the case of a merchant-buyer.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Subsection (2) applies to the particular case of
documents the same principle which the section on effects of acceptance applies
to the case of goods.  The matter is dealt with in this section in terms of
&quot;waiver&quot; of objections rather than of right to revoke acceptance,
partly to avoid any confusion with the problems of acceptance of goods and
partly because defects in documents which are not taken as grounds for
rejection are generally minor ones.  The only defects concerned in the present
subsection are defects in the documents which are apparent on their face. 
Where payment is required against the documents they must be inspected before
payment, and the payment then constitutes acceptance of the documents.  Under
the section dealing with this problem, such acceptance of the documents does
not constitute an acceptance of the goods or impair any options or remedies of
the buyer for their improper delivery.  Where the documents are delivered
without requiring such contemporary action as payment from the buyer, the
reason of the next section on what constitutes acceptance of goods, applies.  Their
acceptance by non-objection is therefore postponed until after a reasonable
time for their inspection.  In either situation, however, the buyer
&quot;waives&quot; only what is apparent on the face of the documents.</p>
