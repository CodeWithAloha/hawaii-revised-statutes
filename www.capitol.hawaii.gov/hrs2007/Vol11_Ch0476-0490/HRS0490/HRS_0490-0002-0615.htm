<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-615  Excuse by failure of presupposed
conditions.</b>  Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater
obligation and subject to the preceding section on substituted performance:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in
part by a seller who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a breach of
his duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made
impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was
a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good
faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order
whether or not it later proves to be invalid.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Where the causes mentioned in paragraph (a)
affect only a part of the seller's capacity to perform, he must allocate
production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include
regular customers not then under contract as well as his own requirements for
further manufacture.  He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that
there will be delay or nondelivery and, when allocation is required under
paragraph (b), of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer. [L
1965, c 208, §2-615; HRS §490:2-615]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  This section excuses a seller from timely delivery of
goods contracted for, where his performance has become commercially
impracticable because of unforeseen supervening circumstances not within the
contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.  The destruction of
specific goods and the problem of the use of substituted performance on points
other than delay or quantity, treated elsewhere in this Article, must be distinguished
from the matter covered by this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The present section deliberately refrains from any effort
at an exhaustive expression of contingencies and is to be interpreted in all
cases sought to be brought within its scope in terms of its underlying reason
and purpose.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The first test for excuse under this Article in terms of
basic assumption is a familiar one.  The additional test of commercial
impracticability (as contrasted with &quot;impossibility,&quot;
&quot;frustration of performance&quot; or &quot;frustration of the
venture&quot;) has been adopted in order to call attention to the commercial
character of the criterion chosen by this Article.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  Increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless
the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen contingency which alters the
essential nature of the performance.  Neither is a rise or a collapse in the
market in itself a justification, for that is exactly the type of business risk
which business contracts made at fixed prices are intended to cover.  But a
severe shortage of raw materials or of supplies due to a contingency such as
war, embargo, local crop failure, unforeseen shutdown of major sources of
supply or the like, which either causes a marked increase in cost or altogether
prevents the seller from securing supplies necessary to his performance, is
within the contemplation of this section.  (See Ford &amp; Sons, Ltd., v. Henry
Leetham &amp; Sons, Ltd., 21 Com. Cas. 55 (1915, K.B.D.).)</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Where a particular source of supply is exclusive under
the agreement and fails through casualty, the present section applies rather
than the provision on destruction or deterioration of specific goods.  The same
holds true where a particular source of supply is shown by the circumstances to
have been contemplated or assumed by the parties at the time of contracting. 
(See Davis Co. v. Hoffman-LaRoche Chemical Works, 178 App. Div. 855, 166 N.Y.S.
179 (1917) and International Paper Co. v. Rockefeller, 161 App. Div. 180, 146
N.Y.S. 371 (1914).)  There is no excuse under this section, however, unless the
seller has employed all due measures to assure himself that his source will not
fail.  (See Canadian Industrial Alcohol Co., Ltd., v. Dunbar Molasses Co., 258
N.Y. 194, 179 N.E. 383, 80 A.L.R. 1173 (1932) and Washington Mfg. Co. v. Midland
Lumber Co., 113 Wash. 593, 194 P. 777 (1921).)</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In the case of failure of production by an agreed source for
causes beyond the seller's control, the seller should, if possible, be excused
since production by an agreed source is without more a basic assumption of the
contract.  Such excuse should not result in relieving the defaulting supplier
from liability nor in dropping into the seller's lap an unearned bonus of
damages over.  The flexible adjustment machinery of this Article provides the
solution under the provision on the obligation of good faith.  A condition to
his making good the claim of excuse is the turning over to the buyer of his
rights against the defaulting source of supply to the extent of the buyer's
contract in relation to which excuse is being claimed.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  In situations in which neither sense nor justice is
served by either answer when the issue is posed in flat terms of
&quot;excuse&quot; or &quot;no excuse,&quot; adjustment under the various
provisions of this Article is necessary, especially the sections on good faith,
on insecurity and assurance and on the reading of all provisions in the light
of their purposes, and the general policy of this Act to use equitable
principles in furtherance of commercial standards and good faith.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  The failure of conditions which go to convenience or
collateral values rather than to the commercial practicability of the main
performance does not amount to a complete excuse.  However, good faith and the
reason of the present section and of the preceding one may properly be held to
justify and even to require any needed delay involved in a good faith inquiry
seeking a readjustment of the contract terms to meet the new conditions.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  8.  The provisions of this section are made subject to
assumption of greater liability by agreement and such agreement is to be found
not only in the expressed terms of the contract but in the circumstances
surrounding the contracting, in trade usage and the like.  Thus the exemptions
of this section do not apply when the contingency in question is sufficiently
foreshadowed at the time of contracting to be included among the business risks
which are fairly to be regarded as part of the dickered terms, either
consciously or as a matter of reasonable, commercial interpretation from the
circumstances.  (See Madeirense Do Brasil, S. A. v. Stulman-Emrick Lumber Co.,
147 F.2d 399 (C.C.A., 2 Cir., 1945).)  The exemption otherwise present through
usage of trade under the present section may also be expressly negated by the
language of the agreement.  Generally, express agreements as to exemptions
designed to enlarge upon or supplant the provisions of this section are to be
read in the light of mercantile sense and reason, for this section itself sets
up the commercial standard for normal and reasonable interpretation and
provides a minimum beyond which agreement may not go.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Agreement can also be made in regard to the consequences of
exemption as laid down in paragraphs (b) and (c) and the next section on
procedure on notice claiming excuse.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  9.  The case of a farmer who has contracted to sell crops to
be grown on designated land may be regarded as falling either within the
section on casualty to identified goods or this section, and he may be excused,
when there is a failure of the specific crop, either on the basis of the
destruction of identified goods or because of the failure of a basic assumption
of the contract.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Exemption of the buyer in the case of a
&quot;requirements&quot; contract is covered by the &quot;Output and
Requirements&quot; section both as to assumption and allocation of the relevant
risks.  But when a contract by a manufacturer to buy fuel or raw material makes
no specific reference to a particular venture and no such reference may be
drawn from the circumstances, commercial understanding views it as a general
deal in the general market and not conditioned on any assumption of the
continuing operation of the buyer's plant.  Even when notice is given by the
buyer that the supplies are needed to fill a specific contract of a normal
commercial kind, commercial understanding does not see such a supply contract
as conditioned on the continuance of the buyer's further contract for outlet. 
On the other hand, where the buyer's contract is in reasonable commercial
understanding conditioned on a definite and specific venture or assumption as,
for instance, a war procurement subcontract known to be based on a prime
contract which is subject to termination, or a supply contract for a particular
construction venture, the reason of the present section may well apply and
entitle the buyer to the exemption.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  10.  Following its basic policy of using commercial
practicability as a test for excuse, this section recognizes as of equal
significance either a foreign or domestic regulation and disregards any
technical distinctions between &quot;law,&quot; &quot;regulation,&quot;
&quot;order&quot; and the like.  Nor does it make the present action of the
seller depend upon the eventual judicial determination of the legality of the
particular governmental action.  The seller's good faith belief in the validity
of the regulation is the test under this Article and the best evidence of his
good faith is the general commercial acceptance of the regulation.  However,
governmental interference cannot excuse unless it truly &quot;supervenes&quot;
in such a manner as to be beyond the seller's assumption of risk.  And any
action by the party claiming excuse which causes or colludes in inducing the
governmental action preventing his performance would be in breach of good faith
and would destroy his exemption.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  11.  An excused seller must fulfill his contract to the
extent which the supervening contingency permits, and if the situation is such
that his customers are generally affected he must take account of all in
supplying one.  Subsections (a) and (b), therefore, explicitly permit in any
proration a fair and reasonable attention to the needs of regular customers who
are probably relying on spot orders for supplies.  Customers at different
stages of the manufacturing process may be fairly treated by including the
seller's manufacturing requirements.  A fortiori, the seller may also take
account of contracts later in date than the one in question.  The fact that
such spot orders may be closed at an advanced price causes no difficulty, since
any allocation which exceeds normal past requirements will not be reasonable. 
However, good faith requires, when prices have advanced, that the seller
exercise real care in making his allocations, and in case of doubt his contract
customers should be favored and supplies prorated evenly among them regardless
of price.  Save for the extra care thus required by changes in the market, this
section seeks to leave every reasonable business leeway to the seller.</p>
