<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-505  Seller's shipment under
reservation.</b>  (1)  Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by
or before shipment:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   The seller's procurement of a negotiable bill of
lading to the seller's own order or otherwise reserves in the seller a security
interest in the goods.  The seller's procurement of the bill to the order of a
financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller's
expectation of transferring that interest to the person named.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   A nonnegotiable bill of lading to the seller or
the seller's nominee reserves possession of the goods as security but except in
a case of conditional delivery (subsection (2) of section 490:2-507) a
nonnegotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security
interest even though the seller retains possession or control of the bill of
lading.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  When shipment by the seller with
reservation of a security interest is in violation of the contract for sale it
constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the preceding
section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and
identification of the goods to the contract nor the seller's powers as a holder
of a negotiable document of title. [L 1965, c 208, §2-505; HRS §490:2-505; am L
2004, c 163, §10]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Section 20(2), (3), (4), Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Completely rephrased, the &quot;powers&quot;
of the parties in cases of reservation being emphasized primarily rather than
the &quot;rightfulness&quot; of reservation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  To continue in
general the policy of the prior uniform statutory provision with certain
modification of emphasis and language, so that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The security interest reserved to the seller under
subsection (1) is restricted to securing payment or performance by the buyer
and the seller is strictly limited in his disposition and control of the goods
as against the buyer and third parties.  Under this Article, the provision as
to the passing of interest expressly applies &quot;despite any reservation of
security title&quot; and also provides that the &quot;rights, obligations and
remedies&quot; of the parties are not altered by the incidence of title
generally.  The security interest, therefore, must be regarded as a means given
to the seller to enforce his rights against the buyer which is unaffected by
and in turn does not affect the location of title generally.  The rules set
forth in subsection (1) are not to be altered by any apparent &quot;contrary
intent&quot; of the parties as to passing of title, since the rights and
remedies of the parties to the contract of sale, as defined in this Article,
rest on the contract and its performance or breach and not on stereotyped
presumptions as to the location of title.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This Article does not attempt to regulate local procedure in
regard to the effective maintenance of the seller's security interest when the
action is in replevin by the buyer against the carrier.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Every shipment of identified goods under a negotiable
bill of lading reserves a security interest in the seller under subsection (1)
paragraph (a).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  It is frequently convenient for the seller to make the bill
of lading to the order of a nominee such as his agent at destination, the
financing agency to which he expects to negotiate the document or the bank
issuing a credit to him.  In many instances, also, the buyer is made the order
party.  This Article does not deal directly with the question as to whether a
bill of lading made out by the seller to the order of a nominee gives the carrier
notice of any rights which the nominee may have so as to limit its freedom or
obligation to honor the bill of lading in the hands of the seller as the
original shipper if the expected negotiation fails.  This is dealt with in the
Article on Documents of Title (Article 7).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  A non-negotiable bill of lading taken to a party other
than the buyer under subsection (1) paragraph (b) reserves possession of the
goods as security in the seller but if he seeks to withhold the goods
improperly the buyer can tender payment and recover them.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  In the case of a shipment by non-negotiable bill of
lading taken to a buyer, the seller, under subsection (1) retains no security
interest or possession as against the buyer and by the shipment he de facto
loses control as against the carrier except where he rightfully and effectively
stops delivery in transit.  In cases in which the contract gives the seller the
right to payment against delivery, the seller, by making an immediate demand
for payment, can show that his delivery is conditional, but this does not
prevent the buyer's power to transfer full title to a sub-buyer in ordinary
course or other purchaser under Section 2-403.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Under subsection (2) an improper reservation by the
seller which would constitute a breach in no way impairs such of the buyer's
rights as result from identification of the goods.  The security title reserved
by the seller under subsection (1) does not protect his holding of the document
or the goods for the purpose of exacting more than is due him under the
contract.</p>
