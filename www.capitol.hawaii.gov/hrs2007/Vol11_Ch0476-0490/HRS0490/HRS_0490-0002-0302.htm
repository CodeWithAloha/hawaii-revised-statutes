<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-302  Unconscionable contract or
clause.</b>  (1)  If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any
clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the
court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of
the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the
application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  When it is claimed or appears to the court
that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall
be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial
setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination. [L
1965, c 208, §2-302; HRS §490:2-302]</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  This section is intended to make it possible for the
courts to police explicitly against the contracts or clauses which they find to
be unconscionable.  In the past such policing has been accomplished by adverse
construction of language, by manipulation of the rules of offer and acceptance
or by determinations that the clause is contrary to public policy or to the
dominant purpose of the contract.  This section is intended to allow the court
to pass directly on the unconscionability of the contract or particular clause
therein and to make a conclusion of law as to its unconscionability.  The basic
test is whether, in the light of the general commercial background and the
commercial needs of the particular trade or case, the clauses involved are so
one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time
of the making of the contract.  Subsection (2) makes it clear that it is proper
for the court to hear evidence upon these questions.  The principle is one of
the prevention of oppression and unfair surprise (Cf. Campbell Soup Co. v. 
Wentz, 172 F.2d 80, 3d Cir. 1948) and not of disturbance of allocation of risks
because of superior bargaining power.  The underlying basis of this section is
illustrated by the results in cases such as the following:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Kansas City Wholesale Grocery Co. v. Weber Packing
Corporation, 93 Utah 414, 73 P.2d 1272 (1937), where a clause limiting time for
complaints was held inapplicable to latent defects in a shipment of catsup
which could be discovered only by microscopic analysis; Hardy v. General Motors
Acceptance Corporation, 38 Ga. App. 463, 144 S.E. 327 (1928), holding that a
disclaimer of warranty clause applied only to express warranties, thus letting
in a fair implied warranty; Andrews Bros. v. Singer &amp; Co. (1934 CA) 1 K.B.
17, holding that where a car with substantial mileage was delivered instead of
a &quot;new&quot; car, a disclaimer of warranties, including those
&quot;implied,&quot; left unaffected an &quot;express obligation&quot; on the
description, even though the Sale of Goods Act called such an implied warranty;
New Prague Flouring Mill Co. v. G. A. Spears, 194 Iowa 417, 189 N.W. 815
(1922), holding that a clause permitting the seller, upon the buyer's failure
to supply shipping instructions, to cancel, ship, or allow delivery date to be
indefinitely postponed 30 days at a time by the inaction, does not indefinitely
postpone the date of measuring damages for the buyer's breach, to the seller's
advantage; and Kansas Flour Mills Co. v. Dirks, 100 Kan. 376, 164 P. 273
(1917), where under a similar clause in a rising market the court permitted the
buyer to measure his damages for non-delivery at the end of only one 30 day
postponement; Green v. Arcos, Ltd. (1931 CA) 47 T.L.R. 336, where a blanket
clause prohibiting rejection of shipments by the buyer was restricted to apply
to shipments where discrepancies represented merely mercantile variations;
Meyer v. Packard Cleveland Motor Co., 106 Ohio St. 328, 140 N.E. 118 (1922), in
which the court held that a &quot;waiver&quot; of all agreements not specified
did not preclude implied warranty of fitness of a rebuilt dump truck for
ordinary use as a dump truck; Austin Co. v. J. H. Tillman Co., 104 Or. 541, 209
P. 131 (1922), where a clause limiting the buyer's remedy to return was held to
be applicable only if the seller had delivered a machine needed for a
construction job which reasonably met the contract description; Bekkevold v.
Potts, 173 Minn. 87, 216 N.W. 790, 59 A.L.R. 1164 (1927), refusing to allow
warranty of fitness for purpose imposed by law to be negated by clause
excluding all warranties &quot;made&quot; by the seller; Robert A. Munroe &amp;
Co. v. Meyer (1930) 2 K.B. 312, holding that the warranty of description
overrides a clause reading &quot;with all faults and defects&quot; where
adulterated meat not up to the contract description was delivered.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Under this section the court, in its discretion, may
refuse to enforce the contract as a whole if it is permeated by the
unconscionability, or it may strike any single clause or group of clauses which
are so tainted or which are contrary to the essential purpose of the agreement,
or it may simply limit unconscionable clauses so as to avoid unconscionable
results.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The present section is addressed to the court, and the
decision is to be made by it.  The commercial evidence referred to in
subsection (2) is for the court's consideration, not the jury's.  Only the
agreement which results from the court's action on these matters is to be
submitted to the general triers of the facts.</p>

declining to apply this section in its determination whether the release was
unconscionable.  111 H. 413, 142 P.3d 277.</p>
