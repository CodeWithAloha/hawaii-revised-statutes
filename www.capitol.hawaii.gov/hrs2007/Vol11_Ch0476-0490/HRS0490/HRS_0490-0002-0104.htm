<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-104  Definitions: 
&quot;merchant&quot;; &quot;between merchants&quot;; &quot;financing
agency&quot;.</b>  (1)  &quot;Merchant&quot; means a person who deals in goods
of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having
knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the
transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his
employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation
holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  &quot;Financing agency&quot; means a bank,
finance company, or other person who in the ordinary course of business makes
advances against goods or documents of title or who by arrangement with either
the seller or the buyer intervenes in ordinary course to make or collect
payment due or claimed under the contract for sale, as by purchasing or paying
the seller's draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for
collection whether or not documents of title accompany or are associated with
the draft.  &quot;Financing agency&quot; includes also a bank or other person
who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the position of seller and
buyer in respect to the goods (section 490:2-707).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  &quot;Between merchants&quot; means in any
transaction with respect to which both parties are chargeable with the
knowledge or skill of merchants. [L 1965, c 208, §2-104; HRS §490:2-104; am L
2004, c 163, §5]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  None.  But see
Sections 15(2), (5), 16(c), 45(2) and 71, Uniform Sales Act, and Sections 35
and 37, Uniform Bills of Lading Act for examples of the policy expressly
provided for in this Article.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  This Article assumes that transactions between
professionals in a given field require special and clear rules which may not
apply to a casual or inexperienced seller or buyer.  It thus adopts a policy of
expressly stating rules applicable &quot;between merchants&quot; and &quot;as
against a merchant&quot;, wherever they are needed instead of making them
depend upon the circumstances of each case as in the statutes cited above. 
This section lays the foundation of this policy by defining those who are to be
regarded as professionals or &quot;merchants&quot; and by stating when a
transaction is deemed to be &quot;between merchants&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The term &quot;merchant&quot; as defined here roots in
the &quot;law merchant&quot; concept of a professional in business.  The
professional status under the definition may be based upon specialized
knowledge as to the goods, specialized knowledge as to business practices, or
specialized knowledge as to both and which kind of specialized knowledge may be
sufficient to establish the merchant status is indicated by the nature of the
provisions.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The special provisions as to merchants appear only in this
Article and they are of three kinds.  Sections 2-201(2), 2-205, 2-207 and 2-209
dealing with the statute of frauds, firm offers, confirmatory memoranda and
modification rest on normal business practices which are or ought to be typical
of and familiar to any person in business.  For purposes of these sections almost
every person in business would, therefore, be deemed to be a
&quot;merchant&quot; under the language &quot;who...by his occupation holds
himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices...involved
in the transaction...&quot; since the practices involved in the transaction are
non-specialized business practices such as answering mail.  In this type of
provision, banks or even universities, for example, well may be
&quot;merchants.&quot;  But even these sections only apply to a merchant in his
mercantile capacity; a lawyer or bank president buying fishing tackle for his
own use is not a merchant.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  On the other hand, in Section 2-314 on the warranty of
merchantability, such warranty is implied only &quot;if the seller is a
merchant with respect to goods of that kind.&quot;  Obviously this
qualification restricts the implied warranty to a much smaller group than
everyone who is engaged in business and requires a professional status as to
particular kinds of goods.  The exception in Section 2-402(2) for retention of
possession by a merchant-seller falls in the same class; as does Section
2-403(2) on entrusting of possession to a merchant &quot;who deals in goods of
that kind&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A third group of sections includes 2-103(1)(b), which
provides that in the case of a merchant &quot;good faith&quot; includes
observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade;
2-327(1)(c), 2-603 and 2-605, dealing with responsibilities of merchant buyers
to follow seller's instructions, etc.; 2-509 on risk of loss, and 2-609 on
adequate assurance of performance.  This group of sections applies to persons
who are merchants under either the &quot;practices&quot; or the
&quot;goods&quot; aspect of the definition of merchant.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The &quot;or to whom such knowledge or skill may be
attributed by his employment of an agent or broker...&quot; clause of the
definition of merchant means that even persons such as universities, for
example, can come within the definition of merchant if they have regular
purchasing departments or business personnel who are familiar with business
practices and who are equipped to take any action required.</p>
