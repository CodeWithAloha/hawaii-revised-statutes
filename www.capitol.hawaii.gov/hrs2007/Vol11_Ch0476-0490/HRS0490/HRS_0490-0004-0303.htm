<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</b>  None.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  The comments to Section 4-213 describe the process
through which an item passes in the payor bank.  Prior to this process or at
any time while it is going on, the payor bank may receive knowledge or a legal
notice affecting the item, such as knowledge or a notice that the drawer has
filed a petition in bankruptcy or made an assignment for the benefit of
creditors; may receive an order of the drawer stopping payment on the item; may
have served on it an attachment of the account of the drawer; or the bank
itself may exercise a right of setoff against the drawer's account.  Each of
these events affects the account of the drawer and may eliminate or freeze all
or part of whatever balance is available to pay the item.  Subsection (1)
states the rule for determining the relative priorities between these various
legal events and the item.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  The rule is that if any one of several things has been
done to the item or if it has reached any one of several stages in its
processing at the time the knowledge, notice, stop-order or legal process is
received or served and a reasonable time for the bank to act thereon expires or
the setoff is exercised, the knowledge, notice, stop-order, legal process or
setoff comes too late, the item has priority and a charge to the customer's
account may be made and is effective.  Certain of the tests determining the
priority status of the item are the same as for final payment under Section 4-213(1),
but additional tests apply in the context of the present section.  The first
event mentioned, namely, acceptance, means formal acceptance as that term is
used and defined in Section 3-410.  Certification is the type of certification
defined in Section 3-411.  Payment of the item in cash under Section
4-213(1)(a), final settlement for the item under Section 4-213(1)(b) and
completion of the process of posting under Section 4-213(1)(c) all constitute
final payment of the item and confer priority.  After a cash payment, final
settlement or the completion of the process of posting, any knowledge, notice,
stop-order, legal process or setoff comes too late and cannot interfere with
either the payment of the item or a charge to the customer's account based upon
such payment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  The sixth event conferring priority is stated by the
language &quot;or otherwise has evidenced by examination of such indicated
account and by action its decision to pay the item.&quot; This general
&quot;omnibus&quot; language is necessary to pick up other possible types of
action impossible to specify particularly but where the bank has examined the
account to see if there are sufficient funds and has taken some action
indicating an intention to pay.  An example is what has sometimes been called &quot;sight
posting&quot; where the bookkeeper examines the account and makes a decision to
pay but postpones posting.  The clause should be interpreted in the light of
Nineteenth Ward Bank v. First Nat. Bank of South Weymouth, 184 Mass. 49, 67
N.E. 670 (1903).  It is not intended to refer to various preliminary acts in no
way close to a true decision of the bank to pay the item, such as receipt of
the item over the counter for deposit, entry of a provisional credit in a
passbook, or the making of a provisional settlement for the item through the
clearing house, by entries in accounts, remittance or otherwise.  All actions
of this type are provisional and none of them evidences the bank's decision to
pay the item.  In this Section as in Section 4-213 reasoning such as appears in
Cohen v. First Nat. Bank of Nogales, 22 Ariz. 394, 400, 198 P. 122, 124, 15
A.L.R. 701 (1921); Briviesca v. Coronado, 19 Cal.2d 244, 120 P.2d 649 (1941);
White Brokerage Co. v. Cooperman, 207 Minn. 239, 290 N.W. 790 (1940); Scotts
Bluff County v. First Nat. Bank of Gering, 115 Neb. 273, 212 N.W. 617, 618
(1927); Provident Savings Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Hildebrand, 49 Ohio App. 207,
196 N.E. 790, 791 (1934); Schaer v. First Nat. Bank of Brenham, 132 Tex. 499,
124 S.W.2d 108 (1939) (bill of exchange); Union State Bank of Lancaster v.
People's State Bank of Lancaster, 192 Wis. 28, 33, 211 N.W. 931, 933 (1927); 1
Paton's Digest 1067, is rejected.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  The seventh and last event conferring priority for an
item and a charge to the customer's account based upon the item is stated by
the language &quot;become accountable for the amount of the item under
subsection (1)(d) of Section 4-213 and Section 4-302 dealing with the payor
bank's responsibility for late return of items&quot;.  Under Section
4-213(1)(d) if a payor bank makes a provisional settlement for an item and
fails to revoke the settlement in the time and manner permitted by statute,
clearing house rule or agreement, such combination of events constitutes final
payment of the item.  Under Section 4-302 a payor bank may also become
accountable for the amount of an item in certain other situations even though
there has been no provisional settlement for the item or such action as
constitutes final payment under Section 4-213(1).  Expiration of the deadlines
under Sections 4-213(1)(d) or 4-302 with resulting accountability by the payor
bank for the amount of the item, establish priority of the item over notices,
stop-orders, legal process or setoff.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  In the case of knowledge, notice, stop-orders and legal
process the effective time for determining whether they were received too late
to affect the payment of an item and a charge to the customer's account by
reason of such payment, is receipt plus a reasonable time for the bank to act
on any of these communications.  Usually a relatively short time is required to
communicate to the bookkeeping department advice of one of these events but
certainly some time is necessary.  Compare Sections 1-201(27) and 4-403.  In
the case of setoff the effective time is when the setoff is actually made.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  As between one item and another no priority rule is
stated, other than the convenience of the bank.  This rule is justified because
of the impossibility of stating a rule that would be fair in all cases, having
in mind the almost infinite number of combinations of large and small checks in
relation to the available balance on hand in the drawer's account; the possible
methods of receipt; and other difficulties.  Further, where the drawer has
drawn all the checks, he should have funds available to meet all of them and
has no basis for urging one should be paid before another; and the holders have
no direct right against the payor bank in any event, unless of course, the bank
has accepted, certified or finally paid a particular item, or has become liable
for it under Section 4-302.  Under subsection (2) the bank obviously has the
right to pay items for which it is itself liable ahead of those for which it is
not.</p>
