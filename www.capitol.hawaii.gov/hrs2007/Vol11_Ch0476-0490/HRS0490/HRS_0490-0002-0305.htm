<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-305  Open price term.</b>  (1)  The
parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the
price is not settled.  In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the
time for delivery if</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Nothing is said as to price; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   The price is left to be agreed by the parties and
they fail to agree; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   The price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed
market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it
is not so set or recorded.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  A price to be fixed by the seller or by
the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  When a price left to be fixed otherwise
than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one party
the other may at his option treat the contract as cancelled or himself fix a
reasonable price.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  Where, however, the parties intend not to
be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed
there is no contract.  In such a case the buyer must return any goods already
received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of
delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Sections 9 and 10, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Completely rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  This section applies when the price term is left open on
the making of an agreement which is nevertheless intended by the parties to be
a binding agreement.  This Article rejects in these instances the formula that
&quot;an agreement to agree is unenforceable&quot; if the case falls within
subsection (1) of this section, and rejects also defeating such agreements on
the ground of &quot;indefiniteness&quot;.  Instead this Article recognizes the
dominant intention of the parties to have the deal continue to be binding upon
both.  As to future performance, since this Article recognizes remedies such as
cover (Section 2-712), resale (Section 2-706) and specific performance (Section
2-716) which go beyond any mere arithmetic as between contract price and market
price, there is usually a &quot;reasonably certain basis for granting an
appropriate remedy for breach&quot; so that the contract need not fail for
indefiniteness.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Under some circumstances the postponement of agreement on
price will mean that no deal has really been concluded, and this is made
express in the preamble of subsection (1) (&quot;The parties if they so
intend&quot;) and in subsection (4).  Whether or not this is so is, in most cases,
a question to be determined by the trier of fact.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  Subsection (2), dealing with the situation where the
price is to be fixed by one party rejects the uncommercial idea that an
agreement that the seller may fix the price means that he may fix any price he
may wish by the express qualification that the price so fixed must be fixed in
good faith.  Good faith includes observance of reasonable commercial standards
of fair dealing in the trade if the party is a merchant.  (Section 2-103).  But
in the normal case a &quot;posted price&quot; or a future seller's or buyer's
&quot;given price,&quot; &quot;price in effect,&quot; &quot;market price,&quot;
or the like satisfies the good faith requirement.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  The section recognizes that there may be cases in which a
particular person's judgment is not chosen merely as a barometer or index of a
fair price but is an essential condition to the parties' intent to make any
contract at all.  For example, the case where a known and trusted expert is to
&quot;value&quot; a particular painting for which there is no market standard
differs sharply from the situation where a named expert is to determine the
grade of cotton, and the difference would support a finding that in the one the
parties did not intend to make a binding agreement if that expert were
unavailable whereas in the other they did so intend.  Other circumstances would
of course affect the validity of such a finding.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Under subsection (3), wrongful interference by one party
with any agreed machinery for price fixing in the contract may be treated by
the other party as a repudiation justifying cancellation, or merely as a
failure to take cooperative action thus shifting to the aggrieved party the
reasonable leeway in fixing the price.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Throughout the entire section, the purpose is to give
effect to the agreement which has been made.  That effect, however, is always
conditioned by the requirement of good faith action which is made an inherent
part of all contracts within this Act.  (Section 1-203).</p>
