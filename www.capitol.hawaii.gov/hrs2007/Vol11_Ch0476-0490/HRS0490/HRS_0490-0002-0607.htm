<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:2-607  Effect of acceptance; notice of
breach; burden of establishing breach after acceptance; notice of claim or
litigation to person answerable over.</b>  (1)  The buyer must pay at the
contract rate for any goods accepted.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes
rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a nonconformity
cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable
assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured but acceptance does
not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this Article for
nonconformity.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Where a tender has been accepted</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>The buyer must within a reasonable time after he
discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or
be barred from any remedy; and</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>If the claim is one for infringement or the like
(subsection (3) of section 490:2-312) and the buyer is sued as a result of such
a breach he must so notify the seller within a reasonable time after he
receives notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for
liability established by the litigation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  The burden is on the buyer to establish
any breach with respect to the goods accepted.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (5)  Where the buyer is sued for breach of a
warranty or other obligation for which his seller is answerable over</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   He may give his seller written notice of the
litigation.  If the notice states that the seller may come in and defend and
that if the seller does not do so he will be bound in any action against him by
his buyer by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then
unless the seller after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and
defend he is so bound.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   If the claim is one for infringement or the like
(subsection (3) of section 490:2-312) the original seller may demand in writing
that his buyer turn over to him control of the litigation including settlement
or else be barred from any remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all
expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after
seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (6)  The provisions of subsections (3), (4) and
(5) apply to any obligation of a buyer to hold the seller harmless against
infringement of the like (subsection (3) of section 490:2-312). [L 1965, c 208,
§2-607; HRS §490:2-607]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Prior</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Statutory</b> <b>Provision:</b> 
Subsection (1) - Section 41, Uniform Sales Act; Subsections (2) and (3) -
Sections 49 and 69, Uniform Sales Act.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Changes:</b>  Rewritten.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  <b>Purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Changes:</b>  To continue the
prior basic policies with respect to acceptance of goods while making a number
of minor though material changes in the interest of simplicity and commercial
convenience so that:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  1.  Under subsection (1), once the buyer accepts a tender the
seller acquires a right to its price on the contract terms.  In cases of
partial acceptance, the price of any part accepted is, if possible, to be
reasonably apportioned, using the type of apportionment familiar to the courts
in quantum valebat cases, to be determined in terms of &quot;the contract
rate,&quot; which is the rate determined from the bargain in fact (the
agreement) after the rules and policies of this Article have been brought to
bear.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  2.  Under subsection (2) acceptance of goods precludes their
subsequent rejection.  Any return of the goods thereafter must be by way of
revocation of acceptance under the next section.  Revocation is unavailable for
a non-conformity known to the buyer at the time of acceptance, except where the
buyer has accepted on the reasonable assumption that the non-conformity would
be seasonably cured.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  3.  All other remedies of the buyer remain unimpaired under
subsection (2).  This is intended to include the buyer's full rights with
respect to future installments despite his acceptance of any earlier
non-conforming installment.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  4.  The time of notification is to be determined by applying
commercial standards to a merchant buyer.  &quot;A reasonable time&quot; for
notification from a retail consumer is to be judged by different standards so
that in his case it will be extended, for the rule of requiring notification is
designed to defeat commercial bad faith, not to deprive a good faith consumer
of his remedy.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The content of the notification need merely be sufficient to
let the seller know that the transaction is still troublesome and must be
watched.  There is no reason to require that the notification which saves the
buyer's rights under this section must include a clear statement of all the
objections that will be relied on by the buyer, as under the section covering
statements of defects upon rejection (Section 2-605).  Nor is there reason for
requiring the notification to be a claim for damages or of any threatened
litigation or other resort to a remedy.  The notification which saves the
buyer's rights under this Article need only be such as informs the seller that
the transaction is claimed to involve a breach, and thus opens the way for
normal settlement through negotiation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  5.  Under this Article various beneficiaries are given rights
for injuries sustained by them because of the seller's breach of warranty. 
Such a beneficiary does not fall within the reason of the present section in
regard to discovery of defects and the giving of notice within a reasonable
time after acceptance, since he has nothing to do with acceptance.  However,
the reason of this section does extend to requiring the beneficiary to notify
the seller that an injury has occurred.  What is said above, with regard to the
extended time for reasonable notification from the lay consumer after the
injury is also applicable here; but even a beneficiary can be properly held to
the use of good faith in notifying, once he has had time to become aware of the
legal situation.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  6.  Subsection (4) unambiguously places the burden of proof
to establish breach on the buyer after acceptance.  However, this rule becomes
one purely of procedure when the tender accepted was non-conforming and the
buyer has given the seller notice of breach under subsection (3).  For
subsection (2) makes it clear that acceptance leaves unimpaired the buyer's
right to be made whole, and that right can be exercised by the buyer not only
by way of cross-claim for damages, but also by way of recoupment in diminution
or extinction of the price.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  7.  Subsections (3)(b) and (5)(b) gives a warrantor against
infringement an opportunity to defend or compromise third-party claims or be
relieved of his liability.  Subsection (5)(a) codifies for all warranties the
practice of voucher to defend.  Compare Section 3-803.  Subsection (6) makes
these provisions applicable to the buyer's liability for infringement under
Section 2-312.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  8.  All of the provisions of the present section are subject
to any explicit reservation of rights.</p>
