<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§415A-18  Administrative dissolution;
reinstatement.</b>  (a)  The director may commence a proceeding to dissolve a
professional corporation administratively if the corporation fails to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Pay any fees prescribed by law;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  File its annual report for a period of two years;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Appoint and maintain an agent for service of
process as required; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  File a statement of a change in the name or
business address of the agent as required under this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Before the director may declare a corporation
dissolved, the director shall give notice of the ground or grounds for
dissolution by mailing the notice to the professional corporation at its last
known address appearing in the records of the director.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If the corporation does not correct each
ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the
director that each ground determined by the director does not exist within
sixty days after the date of mailing of the director's written notice, the
director shall administratively dissolve the corporation by signing a decree of
dissolution that recites the ground for dissolution and its effective date. 
The decree shall be filed in the director's office.  The administrative
dissolution of a corporation shall not terminate the authority of its
registered agent.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Parties of interest may petition a court
of competent jurisdiction to appoint a trustee to settle the affairs of any
professional corporation so dissolved.  If a trustee is appointed, the trustee
shall pay to the State out of any funds that may come into the trustee's hands
as trustee, a sum equal to any penalty imposed under section 414-473.  If a
trustee is not appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the last
directors of the dissolved corporation shall be and act as trustees for the
creditors and shareholders of the dissolved professional corporation with full
powers to settle its affairs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  In each case where the director has given
a professional corporation notice of intention to dissolve the corporation on
the grounds that its articles of incorporation have been procured through
fraud, the corporation shall be entitled to petition for an administrative
hearing under chapter 91 and shall give written notice to the director thereof,
before the director may declare the corporation dissolved under subsection (a).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Within two years after the administrative
dissolution of a professional corporation under this section, the corporation
may be reinstated by the director upon a written application executed by an
officer of the corporation setting forth such information as the director may
require, and contain a certificate from the department of taxation indicating
that all taxes owed by the corporation have been paid, a payment arrangement
has been entered into, or the unpaid tax liabilities are being contested in an
administrative or judicial appeal with the department of taxation, the payment
of all delinquent fees and penalties and the filing of all reports due and
unfiled.  Within the applicable reinstatement period, should the name of the
professional corporation, or a name substantially identical thereto, be
registered or reserved by another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, or limited liability partnership, or should the name or a name substantially
identical thereto be registered as a trade name, trademark, or service mark,
then reinstatement shall be allowed only upon the registration of a new name by
the involuntarily dissolved professional corporation pursuant to the amendment
provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  A professional corporation whose articles
of incorporation have expired shall cease to exist by operation of law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  If a professional corporation was
dissolved due to the expiration of its period of duration, the professional
corporation, at any time within two years of such dissolution, may amend its
articles of incorporation to extend its period of duration; provided that, if
the name of the professional corporation or a name substantially identical
thereto is registered or reserved by another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, or limited liability partnership, or if the name or a name
substantially identical thereto is registered as a trade name, trademark, or
service mark, then the extension of corporate existence shall be allowed only
upon the registration of a new name by the professional corporation pursuant to
the amendment provisions of this chapter. [L 1985, c 259, pt of §1; am L 1987,
c 135, §122; am L 1996, c 92, §9; am L 1998, c 2, §98; am L 1999, c 249, §15;
