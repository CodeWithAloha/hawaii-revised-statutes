<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§431:16-214  Miscellaneous provisions.</b> 
(a)  Nothing in this part shall be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid
assessments of the insureds of an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under
a plan with assessment liability.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  All meetings and records of the board of
directors shall be open to all member insurers except for those meetings and
records pertaining to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation, or
conservation of any member insurer deemed confidential.  A member insurer shall
provide written designation of its representative or representatives to the
board meetings.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Records shall be kept of all negotiations
and meetings in which the association or its representatives are involved to
discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties
under section 431:16-208.  Nothing in subsection (b) shall limit the duty of
the association to render a report of its activities under section
431:2-304(b).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For the purpose of carrying out its
obligations under this part, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor
of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to
covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as
subrogee pursuant to section 431:16-208(m).  Assets of the impaired or
insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue
all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or
insolvent insurer as required by this part.  Assets attributable to covered
policies, as used in this subsection, are that proportion of the assets which
the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the
reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance
written by the impaired or insolvent insurer.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>  (e)(1)  Prior to the termination of any liquidation,
rehabilitation or conservation proceeding, the court may take into
consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the
association, the shareholders, and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and
any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution
of the ownership rights of such insolvent insurer.  In such a determination
consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policyholders of the
continuing or successor insurer.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an
impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount
of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in
carrying out its powers and duties under section 431:16-208 with respect to
such insurer have been fully recovered by the association.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>  (f)(1)  If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of
an insurer domiciled in this State has been entered, the receiver appointed
under such order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from
any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock
dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the
five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to
the limitations of [paragraphs (2) to (4)].</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  No such distribution shall be recoverable if the
insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and
that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the
distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its
contractual obligations.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any person who was an affiliate that controlled
the insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the
amount of distributions the person received.  Any person who was an affiliate
that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall
be liable up to the amount of distributions the person would have received if
they had been paid immediately.  If two or more persons are liable with respect
to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The maximum amount recoverable under this
[subsection] shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets
of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent
insurer.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  If any person liable under [paragraph (3)] is
insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was
paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the
amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L
1989, c 195, §39]</p>
