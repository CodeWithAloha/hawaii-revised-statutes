from office as provided by the law of the state from which the member is
appointed.  Any vacancy occurring in the commission shall be filled in
accordance with the laws of the compacting state wherein such vacancy exists. 
Nothing herein shall be construed to affect the manner in which a compacting
state determines the election or appointment and qualification of its own
commissioner.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Each member shall be entitled to one vote
and shall have an opportunity to participate in the governance of the
commission in accordance with the bylaws.  Notwithstanding any provision herein
to the contrary, no action of the commission with respect to the adoption of a
uniform standard shall be effective unless two-thirds of the members vote in
favor thereof.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The commission, by a majority of the
members, shall prescribe bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary or
appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers of the compact,
including but not limited to:</p>

standards and procedures for the establishment and meetings of other
committees, and governing any general or specific delegation of any authority
or function of the commission;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span style='color:black'>     (4)  Providing reasonable
procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the commission that consist
of a majority of commission members, ensuring reasonable advance notice of each
such meeting, and providing for the right of citizens to attend each such
meeting with enumerated exceptions designed to protect the public's interest,
the privacy of individuals, and insurers' proprietary information, including
trade secrets.  The commission may meet in camera only after a majority of the
entire membership votes to close a meeting in toto<b><i> </i></b>or in part. 
As soon as practicable, the commission shall make public a copy of the vote to
close the meeting revealing the vote of each member with no proxy votes
allowed, and votes taken during such meeting;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span style='color:black'>     </span>(5)  Establishing the
titles, duties, and authority, and reasonable procedures for the election, of
the officers of the commission;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Providing reasonable standards and procedures for
the establishment of the personnel policies and programs of the commission. 
Notwithstanding any civil service or other similar laws of any compacting
state, the bylaws shall exclusively govern the personnel policies and programs
of the commission;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Adopting a code of ethics to address permissible
and prohibited activities of commission members and employees; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Providing a mechanism for winding up the

a convenient form and file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto,
with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the compacting states. [L
