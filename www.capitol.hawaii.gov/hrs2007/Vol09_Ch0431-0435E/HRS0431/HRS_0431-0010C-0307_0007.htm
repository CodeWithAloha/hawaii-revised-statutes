be presented, any false claim for the payment of a loss;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Knowingly presenting, or causing or permitting to
be presented, multiple claims for the same loss or injury, including presenting
multiple claims to more than one insurer, except when these multiple claims are
appropriate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Knowingly making, or causing or permitting to be
made, any false claim for payment of a health care benefit;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Knowingly submitting, or causing or permitting to
be submitted, a claim for a health care benefit that was not used by, or
provided on behalf of, the claimant;</p>

be presented, multiple claims for payment of the same health care benefit
except when these multiple claims are appropriate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Knowingly presenting, or causing or permitting to
be presented, for payment any undercharges for benefits on behalf of a specific
claimant unless any known overcharges for benefits under this article for that

recovery, or compensation obtained or attempted to be obtained is more than
$20,000;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Class C felony if the value of the benefits,
recovery, or compensation obtained or attempted to be obtained is more than
$300; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Misdemeanor if the value of the benefits,
recovery, or compensation obtained or attempted to be obtained is $300 or less.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Where the ability to make restitution can
be demonstrated, any person convicted under this section shall be ordered by a
court to make restitution to an insurer or any other person for any financial
loss sustained by the insurer or other person caused by the act or acts for
which the person was convicted.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A person, if acting without malice, shall
not be subject to civil liability for providing information, including filing a
report, furnishing oral or written evidence, or giving testimony concerning
suspected, anticipated, or completed insurance fraud to a court, the
commissioner, the insurance fraud investigations unit, the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners, any federal, state, or county law enforcement or
regulatory agency, or another insurer if the information is provided only for
the purpose of preventing, investigating, or prosecuting insurance fraud,

article and all claim forms provided and required by an insurer, regardless of
the means of transmission, shall contain, or have attached to them, the
following or a substantially similar statement, in a prominent location and
typeface as determined by the insurer:  &quot;For your protection, Hawaii law
requires you to be informed that presenting a fraudulent claim for payment of a
loss or benefit is a crime punishable by fines or imprisonment, or both.&quot; 
The absence of such a warning in any application or claim form shall not
constitute a defense to a charge of insurance fraud under this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  An insurer, or the insurer's employee or
agent, having determined that there is reason to believe that a claim is being
made in violation of this section, shall provide to the insurance fraud
investigations unit within sixty days of that determination, information,
including documents and other evidence, regarding the claim in the form and
manner prescribed by the unit.  Information provided pursuant to this
subsection shall be protected from public disclosure to the extent authorized
by chapter 92F and section 431:2-209; provided that the unit may release the
information in an administrative or judicial proceeding to enforce this
section, to a federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory authority,
to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or to an insurer
aggrieved by the claim reasonably believed to violate this section. [L 1997, c
