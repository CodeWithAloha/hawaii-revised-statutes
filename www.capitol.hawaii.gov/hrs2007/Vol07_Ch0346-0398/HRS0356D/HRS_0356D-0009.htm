the development or administration of low-income housing or slum clearance
projects, any agreement made under this section relating to the project shall
inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by that government.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Insofar as this subsection is inconsistent with
the provisions of any other law, this subsection shall control.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Any county in which a public housing
project is located or is about to be located may make donations or advances to
the authority in sums as the county in its discretion may determine.  The
advances or donations shall be made for the purpose of aiding or cooperating in
the construction and operation of the public housing project.  The authority,
when it has money available therefor, shall reimburse the county for all
advances made by way of a loan to it. [L 2006, c 180, pt of §2]</p>
