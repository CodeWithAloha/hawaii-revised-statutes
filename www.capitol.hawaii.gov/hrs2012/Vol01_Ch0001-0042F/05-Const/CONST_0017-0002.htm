CONVENTION</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>Section 2.</b>  The legislature may submit
to the electorate at any general or special election the question, &quot;Shall
there be a convention to propose a revision of or amendments to the
Constitution?&quot;  If any nine-year period shall elapse during which the
question shall not have been submitted, the lieutenant governor shall certify
the question, to be voted on at the first general election following the
expiration of such period.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>ELECTION
OF DELEGATES</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If a majority of the ballots cast upon such a
question be in the affirmative, delegates to the convention shall be chosen at
the next regular election unless the legislature shall provide for the election
of delegates at a special election.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Notwithstanding any provision in this constitution
to the contrary, other than Section 3 of Article XVI, any qualified voter of
the district concerned shall be eligible to membership in the convention.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The legislature shall provide for the number of
delegates to the convention, the areas from which they shall be elected and the
manner in which the convention shall convene.  The legislature shall also
provide for the necessary facilities and equipment for the convention.  The
convention shall have the same powers and privileges, as nearly as practicable,
as provided for the convention of 1978.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>MEETING</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The constitutional convention shall convene not
less than five months prior to the next regularly scheduled general election.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>ORGANIZATION;
PROCEDURE</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The convention shall determine its own organization
and rules of procedure.  It shall be the sole judge of the elections, returns
and qualifications of its members and, by a two-thirds vote, may suspend or
remove any member for cause.  The governor shall fill any vacancy by
appointment of a qualified voter from the district concerned.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>RATIFICATION;
APPROPRIATIONS</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The convention shall provide for the time and
manner in which the proposed constitutional revision or amendments shall be
submitted to a vote of the electorate; provided that each amendment shall be
submitted in the form of a question embracing but one subject; and provided
further, that each question shall have designated spaces to mark YES or NO on
the amendment.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     At least thirty days prior to the submission of
any proposed revision or amendments, the convention shall make available for
public inspection, a full text of the proposed amendments.  Every public
library, office of the clerk of each county, and the chief election officer
shall be provided such texts and shall make them available for public
inspection.  The full text of any proposed revision or amendments shall also be
made available for inspection at every polling place on the day of the election
at which such revision or amendments are submitted.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The convention shall, as provided by law, be
responsible for a program of voter education concerning each proposed revision
or amendment to be submitted to the electorate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The revision or amendments shall be effective
only if approved at a general election by a majority of all the votes tallied
upon the question, this majority constituting at least fifty per cent of the
total vote cast at the election, or at a special election by a majority of all
the votes tallied upon the question, this majority constituting at least thirty
per cent of the total number of registered voters.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The provisions of this section shall be
self-executing, but the legislature shall make the necessary appropriations and
may enact legislation to facilitate their operation. [Am Const Con 1968 and
election Nov&nbsp;5, 1968; ren and am Const Con 1978 and election Nov&nbsp;7,
1978; am SB 578 (1979) and SB 1703 (1980) and election Nov&nbsp;4, 1980]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Delegates to convention cannot be elected at the same time
the referendum is taken.  Att. Gen. Op. 65-16.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The legislature may enact a statute providing that an
election will be held on a specified date to ratify the constitutional
amendment proposed by the constitutional convention if a date is not provided
by the convention; but the legislature alone cannot specify the date the
election must be held.  Att. Gen. Op. 67-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Whether amendments are submitted to electorate for
ratification separately or together as a unit is for the convention to
determine.  Att. Gen. Op. 68-9.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Convention may determine manner of submitting its proposals
to the electorate.  Att. Gen. Op. 68-23.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A proposal of the convention becomes effective upon
ratification by electors on election day, not upon certification of results by
lieutenant governor.  Att. Gen. Op. 68-31.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Full ten-year period must elapse before question can be
placed on ballot by lieutenant governor.  Att. Gen. Op. 75-6.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Legislature cannot call constitutional convention without
putting question on ballot.  Att. Gen. Op. 75-6.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Legislature may not enact statute prohibiting elected
officials from being delegates to constitutional convention. Att. Gen. Op.
75-10.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Individual may run both as candidate for public office and as
delegate to constitutional convention even though elections are concurrent. 
Att. Gen. Op. 75-12.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Delegates to convention devising reapportionment plan are not
prohibited from becoming candidates under the new plan.  Att. Gen. Op. 77-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Legislature can provide that public employees elected as
delegates shall have leave without pay without loss of other benefits.  Att.

<p class=XNotes>  Only the legislature may appropriate funds for the
convention. Att. Gen. Op. 77-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Time limits on convention are set by the delegates, not the
legislature.  Att. Gen. Op. 77-3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Provisions of federal Equal Time Law will apply to candidates
seeking election as delegates to the constitutional convention. Att. Gen. Op.
78-2.</p>

and spoiled ballots.  Att. Gen. Op. 82-7.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Law Journals and Reviews</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A History of Revision:  The Constitutional Convention
Question in Hawaii, 1950-2008.  31 UH L. Rev. 291.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Constitutional challenge to 1996 constitutional convention
vote rejected and Hawaii vote upheld, where plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that
Hawaii State AFL-CIO v. Yoshina was a totally unforeseeable interpretation of
the State's election laws and, therefore, amounted to a denial of substantive
due process.  140 F.3d 1218.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Failure to seek preelection relief in federal court barred
attempt to invalidate results of November&nbsp;7, 1978 general election
concerning amendments to state constitution because plaintiffs had knowledge of
alleged irregularities prior to election and ample time to seek relief.  470 F.
Supp. 1195.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Constitutional amendment ballot found partially defective. 
60 H. 324, 590 P.2d 543.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Ballots cast&quot;, within meaning of this section,
includes blank ballots and over votes.  84 H. 374, 935 P.2d 89.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The publication and disclosure language of this section and
§3 of the Hawaii constitution is clear and unambiguous; thus it must be
construed as written; insofar as they clearly regulate amendments to the
constitution, these provisions are not merely directory, but mandatory.  104 H.
128, 85 P.3d 1079.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where state defendants failed to comply with the requirements
set forth in the Hawaii constitution regarding publication and disclosure of
the text of a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing the initiation of
felony prosecutions by written information, the amendment was not validly
ratified in accordance with the mandate of this section and §3 of this
article.  104 H. 128, 85 P.3d 1079.</p>
