<p class=XNotes>  Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000
(RLUIPA), assuming it was constitutional, did not facially invalidate Hawaii's

the sections required a religious organization to obtain a special use permit,

<p class=XNotes>  Under subsection (a)(4) and (10), a chimney and garage are
permitted as accessories to a farm dwelling; however, utilizing the chimney to
conceal an antenna and the garage to house communication equipment were not
permitted uses under either paragraph (4) or (10). 106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the circumstances of the case, the residence and the
chimney with the concealed antenna constituted a &quot;communications equipment
building&quot; and, thus, were permitted uses under subsection (a)(7); also, as
the garage was not abnormally large and was designed specifically to store the
communications equipment for the concealed antenna, utilizing the permitted
garage structure to house the communications equipment for the antenna was a
permitted use under subsection (a)(7). 106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930.</p>
