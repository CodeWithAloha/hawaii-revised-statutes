<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  This subsection applies to property owned
in fee simple, leased, or rented for a period of one year or more, by the

the person claiming the exemption.  If the property for which exemption is
claimed is leased or rented, the lease or rental agreement shall be in force
and recorded in the bureau of conveyances.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Exemption is allowed by this subsection to the
following property:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Property used for school purposes including:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Kindergartens, grade schools, junior high

federal credit unions in the State.  Notwithstanding any provision in this
section to the contrary, the exemption shall apply to property or any portion
thereof that is leased, rented, or otherwise let to another, if the leasing,
renting, or letting is to a nonprofit association, organization, or
corporation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  This subsection shall apply to property
owned in fee simple or leased or rented for a period of one year or more, the
lease or rental agreement being in force and recorded in the bureau of
conveyances at the time the exemption is claimed, by either:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A corporation, society, association, or trust
having a charter or other enabling act or governing instrument which contains a
provision or has been construed by a court of competent jurisdiction as
providing that in the event of dissolution or termination of the corporation,

the exempt purpose, the real property shall be applied for another charitable
purpose or shall be dedicated to the public, or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A corporation chartered by the United States

facilities qualifying for a loan under the laws of the United States as
authorized by Section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 as amended by the Housing Act
of 1961, the Senior Citizens Housing Act of 1962, the Housing Act of 1964, and
the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If any portion of the property which might
otherwise be exempted under this section is used for commercial or other purposes
not within the conditions necessary for exemption (including any use the
primary purpose of which is to produce income even though such income is to be
used for or in furtherance of the exempt purposes) that portion of the premises
shall not be exempt but the remaining portion of the premises shall not be
deprived of the exemption if the remaining portion is used exclusively for
purposes within the conditions necessary for exemption.  In the event of an
exemption of a portion of a building, the tax shall be assessed upon so much of
the value of the building (including the land thereunder and the appurtenant
premises) as the proportion of the floor space of the nonexempt portion bears
to the total floor space of the building.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The term &quot;for nonprofit
purposes&quot;, as used in this section requires that no monetary gain or
economic benefit inure to the person claiming the exemption, or any private
