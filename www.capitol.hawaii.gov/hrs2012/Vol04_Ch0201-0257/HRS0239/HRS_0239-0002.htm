237-13(6)(D), as determined by the home service provider's books and records
kept in the ordinary course of business.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>          For the purposes of this paragraph,
&quot;customer&quot;, &quot;home service provider&quot;, &quot;mobile
telecommunications services&quot;, &quot;place of primary use&quot;, and
&quot;serving carrier&quot; have the same meaning as in section 239-22.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The words &quot;gross income&quot; and

construed to include dividends (as defined by section 235-1) paid by one member
of an affiliated public service company group to another member of the same

chapter shall apply to each person with respect to each person's respective
portion of the proceeds.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Accounts found to be worthless and actually
charged off for income tax purposes, at corresponding periods, may be deducted
from gross income as specified under this chapter so far as the accounts
reflect taxable sales, but shall be added to gross income when and if

public utilities commission.</p>

public utility subject to the tax rate imposed by section 239-5(a) is the
operating revenues less the operating expenses and tax accruals, including in
the computation of such revenues and expenses, debits and credits arising from
equipment rents and joint facility rents.  In the event that, but for this
sentence, deductions could not be had for expenses of services because such
services were rendered by the same person or persons constituting the public
utility or could not be had for income taxes, because such taxes were levied
against the person or persons constituting the public utility in the person's
or their individual capacity and not as a separate entity, there nevertheless
shall be allowed as deductions in computing the net operating income (A) a
reasonable allowance for the value of personal services actually rendered, and
(B) such proportion of the actual amount of income taxes, federal and state, as
fairly represents the portion of the income so taxed which was derived from the
public utility business.</p>

&quot;points in the State&quot; shall be deemed to be such if they are loading,
unloading, transshipment, assembly, transfer, or relay points.</p>

defined by section 264-1 including both state and county highways, but
operation upon rails shall not be deemed transportation on the public highways.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Public service company&quot; means a
public utility, motor carrier, or contract carrier.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Public utility&quot; has the meaning
