<p class=RegularParagraphs>for the purpose of developing and financing a

a site for a renewable energy project or access to the project;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Easements or other possessory interests, whether

lot as a renewable energy project site or access to the project;</p>

other instruments providing for the right to use all or a portion of a legal
lot as delineated on a map for a renewable energy project site or access to the

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Mortgages and other security interests may be
granted with respect to any lease or easement created pursuant to this section,
and the holders of such mortgages or other security interests may foreclose
upon the lease or easement covered and otherwise enforce the terms of the
mortgage and security documents, subject to compliance with applicable laws
other than subdivision requirements.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The land court, bureau of conveyances, and
other governmental agencies shall accept for filing and recording all
instruments and maps pertaining to leases, easements, mortgages, and other
security documents authorized pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The exemption from subdivision

following limitations:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The lease or easement shall restrict the use of
the leased land or easement area to the development and operation of a
renewable energy project; provided that, to comply with section 205-4.6,
agricultural uses and activities shall not be restricted on agricultural land;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The lease shall have an initial term of at least
twenty years;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  With respect to leases and easements on lands
within an agricultural state land use district, the exemption from subdivision
requirements provided by this section shall be for:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Solar energy facilities permitted under

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Any renewable energy facilities approved
by the land use commission or county planning commission under chapter 205;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  With respect to leases and easements on lands
within a conservation state land use district, the exemption from subdivision
requirements provided by this section shall be for:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Wind energy facilities, including the
appurtenances associated with the production and transmission of wind-generated
energy; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Any renewable energy facilities permitted
or approved by the board of land and natural resources under chapter 183C; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The county agency charged with administering
subdivisions in the county in which the renewable energy project is to be
situated or, if the land is in a conservation state land use district, the
department of land and natural resources, shall approve the exemption from
subdivision requirements within ninety days after the project's developer and
the owner of the land on which the renewable energy project is to be situated
have submitted the conceptual schematics or preliminary plans and
specifications for the renewable energy project to the county agency or the
department of land and natural resources, and have provided to such county
agency or the department of land and natural resources, as applicable, a
certification and agreement that all applicable and appropriate environmental
reviews and permitting shall be completed prior to commencement of development
of the renewable energy project.  If, on the ninety-first day, an exemption has
not been approved, it shall be deemed disapproved by the county agency or the

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Nothing in this section shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Exempt the actual development, construction, or operation

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Prevent any agency or authority that issues permits
or approvals for renewable energy projects from imposing reasonable and
appropriate restrictions on the type of siting, development, construction, and
operation of a renewable energy project to protect agricultural resources and
activities, the environment, natural resources, cultural resources and
activities, or the health, safety, and welfare of the State.</p>

that may be allowed within an agricultural or conservation district;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Determine criteria for the appropriate siting of
the renewable energy project within an agricultural or conservation district;

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Identify mitigation measures applicable to
renewable energy projects to protect agricultural resources and activities, the
environment, natural resources, cultural resources and activities, health,
safety, and welfare of the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  This section is not intended to diminish
the discretion of any agency or any authority to approve or disapprove any
permit application. [L 2009, c 173, §§2, 7; am L 2010, c 151, §§2, 4; am L
