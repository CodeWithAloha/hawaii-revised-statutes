<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§707-712  Assault in the third degree.</b> 
(1)  A person commits the offense of assault in the third degree if the person:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes
bodily injury to another person; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Negligently causes bodily injury to another
person with a dangerous instrument.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Assault in the third degree is a
misdemeanor unless committed in a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual
consent, in which case it is a petty misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen
ch 1993]</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §§707-710 TO 712</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  These sections of the Code consolidate offenses previously
classified as &quot;assault&quot;, &quot;battery&quot;, and
&quot;affray&quot;.[1]  Nonfatal bodily offenses against the person are termed
assaults, and are graded according to the gravity of the harm or danger they
represent.[2]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Assault in the first degree, as defined in §707-710, is the
most serious, combining the requirements of the most culpable states of mind
with the most serious bodily injury, short of homicide.  Accordingly, assault
in the first degree is made a class B felony, one class below murder.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Assault in the second degree, as defined in §707-711,
embodies two types of behavior-and-result.  (1) When a person acts
intentionally or knowingly, with a dangerous instrument, the definition of the
offense does not require the bodily injury inflicted to be serious, as in the
first degree.  However, the offense is still a felony, albeit one class lower. 
Assault offenses are intended to penalize injurious conduct to the bodily
integrity of the person.  The danger represented by the use of a dangerous
instrument is largely inchoate in nature, and, although constituting an
aggravating circumstance, the danger is not of the same order as the actual
infliction of serious bodily injury.  Hence, the offense is a class C felony. 
(2) When a person acts recklessly the person's state of mind is far less
culpable than the intentional or knowing actor; however, the employment of a
dangerous instrument and the infliction of serious harm present dangers which,
in total, require treatment as a class C felony.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Assault in the third degree, as defined in §707-712, is
treated as a misdemeanor.  In subsection (1)(a), where a person acts
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, the less serious nature of the injury,
together with the absence of aggravating circumstances, warrant the less severe
penalty.  In subsection (1)(b), negligent culpability will suffice where the
aggravating circumstance of a dangerous instrument is present.  Assault in the
third degree is reduced to a petty misdemeanor if the harm is inflicted in a
fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Code's gradation of assaults follows generally the Model
Penal Code.[3]  Previous Hawaii law defined assault in terms of attempt to
injure another.[4]  Also included was the placing of another in apprehension of
being injured.[5]  The Code handles this latter case in the sections on
Reckless Endangering (§§707-713 and 714) and Terroristic Threatening
(§707-715).  After the definition of the basic offense of assault, the Hawaii
Revised Statutes listed three classes of aggravating circumstances, calling for
either felony or misdemeanor sanctions, depending upon the severity of the
aggravation.[6]  The unaggravated offense was slightly more severe than, but
roughly equivalent to, a petty misdemeanor.[7]  Consensual scuffles were
included in the unaggravated offense.[8]  Hence the Code is similar in both
structure and penalty to prior Hawaii law, but achieves greater economy and
clarity of statement.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §§707-710 TO 712</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 84, Session Laws 1979, added subsection (c) to §707-711
as a means of deterring a rising number of assaults committed against
correctional officers.  The Legislature found that due to the very nature of a
corrections facility, a high probability existed that correctional workers who
were not on duty might be assaulted within the facility.  Conference Committee
Report No. 14.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 257, Session Laws 1987, amended §707-711 to give
educational workers added protection by making it a crime to assault them. 
Senate Conference Committee Report No. 24, House Conference Committee Report
No. 20.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 279, Session Laws 1988, amended §707-711 to clarify that
second degree assault does not include persons injuring themselves.  House
Standing Committee Report No. 1598-88.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §707-711(1) by adding, as
an element of the offense of assault in the second degree, the reckless causing
of substantial bodily injury to another person.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 298, Session Laws 2006, amended §707-711 by including an
employee of a charter school in the definition of &quot;educational
worker&quot;.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 9, Session Laws 2007, amended §707-711(1)(e) by deleting
the brackets around the word &quot;or&quot; to ratify the revisor's insertion
of &quot;or&quot;, which was done to blend the amendments by Acts 230 and 298,
Session Laws 2006, to the definition of &quot;educational worker&quot;.  House
Standing Committee Report No. 807.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 79, Session Laws 2007, amended §707-711(1) by
establishing a criminal offense of assault in the second degree if a person
intentionally [or] knowingly causes bodily injury to any emergency medical
services personnel who is engaged in the performance of duty.  The legislature found
that emergency medical services personnel are at a heightened risk of personal
injury or death from patients and others with whom they are in contact in the
course of their work.  By the very nature of the job, emergency medical
services personnel respond to people in distressful situations, which include
incidences of criminal violence, family disputes, and drunken brawls.  Although
the legislature acknowledged that much of the violence promulgated from
explosive situations involving agitated people who lack momentary self-control,
the legislature believed that emergency medical [services] personnel should be
afforded the same protection as correctional workers and educational workers. 
Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1244.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 100, Session Laws 2008, amended §707-711(1) by making an
assault on a person employed at a state-operated or -contracted mental health
facility assault in the second degree, a class C felony.  The legislature found
that mental health professionals need to be protected from criminal behavior
that, at times, occurs during the course of performing their job duties.  Act
100 imposed the same penalty on a defendant that knowingly [or intentionally]
assaults a staff member at the Hawaii state hospital as that imposed for assaults
that occur in a school or correctional facility.  Senate Standing Committee
Report No. 2331, Conference Committee Report No. 37-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 146, Session Laws 2010, amended §707-711(1) by expanding
the class of emergency services providers protected against assault to include,
among others, physicians, physician's assistants, nurses, and nurse
practitioners providing medical services in a hospital emergency room.  The
legislature found that emergency medical workers serve an indispensable public
need but face a high level of risk in the line of duty.  Nationally, studies
show that between thirty-five per cent and eighty per cent of hospital staff
have been physically assaulted at least once and that nurses are at an
increased risk for violence while on duty.  The legislature found that
extending the offense of assault in the second degree to include actions
against emergency services providers in emergency rooms is a logical extension
of the existing provisions covering emergency response personnel.  Senate Standing
Committee Report Nos. 2989 and 2765, House Standing Committee Report No.
466-10, Conference Committee Report No. 33-10.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 63, Session Laws 2011, amended §707-711(1) by
establishing second degree assault for a person who causes bodily injury to a
person: (1) from whom the defendant has been restrained, by order of any court,
from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing pursuant to domestic abuse
protective orders; or (2) who is being protected by a police officer ordering
the defendant to leave the premises of the protected person, during the
effective period of the order.  The legislature found that domestic violence
victims need added protection under Hawaii law.  Restraining orders or orders
from police officers to abusers to leave the premises are intended to remove
abusers from the vicinity of domestic violence victims and provide safety.  The
legislature believed that domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable
when they attempt to disengage from their abusers and at that time, violence
and the threat of violence are at the most extreme levels.  Increasing the
penalties against abusers in those situations may deter violent retaliation and
may help break victims from the cycle of violence.  House Standing Committee
Report No. 930, Conference Committee Report No. 74, Senate Standing Committee
Report No. 1255.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 187, Session Laws 2011, amended §707-711(1) by adding to
the offense of assault in the second degree intentionally or knowingly causing
bodily injury to a firefighter or water safety officer who is engaged in the
performance of duty.  Firefighters and water safety officers, like correctional
workers, educational workers, and emergency medical services providers, may
find themselves in hostile and volatile situations, stemming from drug use by
or domestic violence between members of the public.  The volatile situations
can erupt and place a firefighter or water safety officer in danger trying to
perform public safety functions.  Conference Committee Report No. 32.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's motion to dismiss federal indictment granted,
where the government relied on defendant's no contest plea to assault in the
third degree as the predicate misdemeanor conviction of domestic violence;
force is not a required element for an assault in the third degree conviction
and the record did not demonstrate that defendant pled to conduct that involved
the use of physical force.  301 F. Supp. 2d 1142.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Harassment, in violation of §711-1106, is not a lesser
included offense of assault in the third degree.  63 H. 1, 620 P.2d 250.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not a lesser included offense of assault in the second
degree.  68 H. 276, 711 P.2d 1289.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Circuit court was obligated, even absent a request by either
party, to instruct the jury regarding the included offense of assault in third
degree where appellant was charged with committing offense of assault in second
degree; court's failure to do so constituted plain error.  76 H. 387, 879 P.2d
492.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Thirteen-year-old appellant's waiver of right to counsel was
not knowing and voluntary because the family court failed to set forth nature
of assault charge against appellant.  77 H. 46, 881 P.2d 533.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where assault against police officer count of oral charge was
fatally defective, oral charge alleged all of essential elements of  assault in
the third degree, and circuit court found that all of those elements had been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, case remanded for entry of
judgment of conviction of assault in third degree and for resentencing in
accordance therewith.  77 H. 309, 884 P.2d 372.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under either §701-109(4)(a) or (4)(c), a petty misdemeanor
assault under subsection (2) is not a lesser included offense of family abuse
under §709-906.  93 H. 63, 996 P.2d 268.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Evidence was not sufficient to support finding of bodily
injury.  2 H. App. 19, 624 P.2d 1374.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Court's finding that witness suffered pain and sustained
injuries not clearly erroneous.  79 H. 265 (App.), 900 P.2d 1332.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Court's failure to personally engage defendant in
on-the-record colloquy to determine whether defendant understood consequences
of foregoing right to have jury instructed on third degree assault, the
lesser-included offense of second degree assault, constituted plain error.  85
H. 44 (App.), 936 P.2d 1292.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Mentioned:  74 H. 54, 837 P.2d 1298.</p>
