<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Property of another&quot; means property
which any person, other than the defendant, has possession of or any other
interest in, even though that possession or interest is unlawful; however, a

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §708-800</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 708-800 provides definitions of terms used repeatedly
throughout this chapter; it does not specify any penal offense.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As with other statutory definitions provided by this Code, a
discussion of the definitions when needed or appropriate is found in the
commentary on the sections employing the terms defined.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-800</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 136, Session Laws 1973, modified the definition of
&quot;building&quot; and Act 200, Session Laws 1974, further clarified it.  As
amended in 1974, &quot;building&quot; includes any structure, and the term also
includes any vehicle, railway car, aircraft, or watercraft used for lodging of
persons therein.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In explaining the change in 1974, the Senate Judiciary
Committee in Standing Committee Report No. 1065-74 stated that it was clear the
phrase, &quot;used for lodging of persons therein&quot; was added by Act 136,
Session Laws 1973, &quot;to modify the terms 'vehicle, railway car, aircraft,
or watercraft' and not the word 'structure.'  However, it is possible to
interpret the present definition as including 'structures' only when 'used for
lodging of persons therein.'  Such an interpretation means that stores, warehouses,
and other commercial buildings not primarily used for the lodging of persons
will not be included in the definition of 'building.'  As a further result,
persons breaking into such places cannot be charged with burglary because the
commission of that crime involves breaking into a 'building' as defined in
§708-800(1).&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 54, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding the
definition of &quot;aquaculture product&quot; for the purpose of protecting
Hawaii's aquaculture industry by deterring theft from aquaculture farms, which
could cause devastating losses to research facilities and businesses.  House
Standing Committee Report No. 1184-92, Senate Standing Committee Report No.
1671.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 218, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by adding a
definition for &quot;agricultural equipment, supplies, or products&quot;.  The
legislature sought to prevent the theft of agricultural equipment, supplies, or
products by subjecting violators to a class C felony in §708-831.  Conference
Committee Report No. 52.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 287, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by adding a
definition for &quot;encoding&quot;.  The legislature intended to provide
criminal sanctions for the fraudulent encoding of a credit card in
§708-8100.5.  Conference Committee Report No. 102.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 222, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;telecommunication service provider&quot; and by
amending the definitions of &quot;telecommunication service&quot; and
&quot;telecommunication service device&quot;.  The Act was intended to expand
the scope of the law establishing the offense of telecommunication service
fraud, to include fraud involving cellular telephone devices and services.  The
legislature recognized that cellular telephone fraud had become a major problem
in the country, increasing consumer costs, and contributing to increased
drug-related criminal activity, and that current state law did not provide
comprehensive protection for telecommunication services theft.  House Standing
Committee Report No. 1521-96, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2017.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 198, Session Laws 1997, expanded the definition of
&quot;credit card&quot; to include electronic benefit transfer cards and debit
cards, in order to criminalize the fraudulent use of debit and electronic
benefit transfer cards under part X of chapter 708.  Senate Standing Committee
Report No. 1547.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 45, Session Laws 2002, amended the definition of
&quot;hotel&quot; to clarify that the definition in relation to offenses
against property rights means a structure in which a majority of the tenants
are roomers or boarders.  The current definition required all tenants to be
roomers or boarders.  However, hotel structures will rarely be totally occupied
by roomers or boarders at the exclusion of commercial tenants such as shops and
restaurants.  The amended definition would more accurately reflect the current
state of hotel operations.  House Standing Committee Report No. 176-02, Senate
Standing Committee Report No. 2461.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 224, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;personal information&quot;.  The legislature found that
misappropriation of personal identification information was on the rise.  Act
224 addresses the criminal conduct associated with intentional identity theft. 
Conference Committee Report No. 25-02.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 182, Session Laws 2005, amended the definition of
&quot;agricultural equipment, supplies, or products&quot; by adding
agricultural &quot;commodities&quot; in the definition.  Act 182 addressed the
problem of agricultural theft in Hawaii by amending various provisions of Hawaii's theft laws relating to agricultural livestock and products.  Conference Committee
Report No. 77, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1359.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 139, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;confidential personal information&quot;.  Act 139 made
it a crime to intentionally or knowingly possess the confidential information
of another without that person's authorization.  Hawaii law enforcement has
found it difficult to curb the rise in identity theft-related crimes when
identity thieves in possession of personal information who have not yet caused
a monetary loss to the victim cannot be prosecuted for crimes other than petty
misdemeanor thefts.  The legislature found that amending the law to make
intentionally or knowingly possessing the confidential information of another
without authorization a class C felony would help to deter identity theft
crimes.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2636.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 156, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products&quot;. 
Act 156 established intentionally or knowingly damaging the agricultural or
aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products of another as an offense of
criminal property damage.  The legislature found that increasing the penalties
for criminal property damage offenses was consistent with the great impact
these crimes have on Hawaii's agricultural and aquacultural industries and the
ability of individual farmers and ranchers to earn a living.  Senate Standing
Committee Report Nos. 3021 and 3310.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 181, Session Laws 2006, amended the definition of
&quot;widely dangerous means&quot; by excluding &quot;fire&quot; from the
definition.  Act 181 included arson as a new class of property damage and
defined four degrees of the offense of arson with appropriate sanctions. The legislature
found that fires that are intentionally set cause extensive damage to public
and private properties and threaten lives.  Conference Committee Report No.
50-06.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 208, Session Laws 2011, amended the definition of
&quot;enter or remain unlawfully&quot; by deleting the provision that a person
who enters or remains on unimproved and apparently unused land that is not
fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders, unless
notice against trespass has been given, is allowed to be on the land and is not
trespassing.  The legislature recognized that, in many cases, trespassers are
armed and found many miles from the nearest town or police station, and that in
these situations, personal notice is impractical and even dangerous.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 1254, Conference Committee Report No. 59.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant did not intend to permanently deprive car
dealership of vehicle where evidence indicated defendant wanted to have new
vehicle to drive for weekend then return it when defendant's deception was
discovered.  86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant returned new vehicle after 72 hour possession
and prosecution was unable to prove any economic loss to car dealership, no
intent to deprive dealership of significant portion of vehicle's economic
value, use, or benefit.  86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Inasmuch as the &quot;intent to defraud&quot; component of
second degree theft by shoplifting, as defined by this section, prescribes two
alternative means of establishing the state of mind requisite to the offense of
second degree theft by shoplifting, trial court plainly erred in failing to
instruct jury as to the alternative states of mind requisite to the charged
offense.  101 H. 389, 69 P.3d 517.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The alternative states of mind potentially requisite to the
charged offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, as prescribed by the
definition of &quot;intent to defraud&quot; set forth in this section, does not
implicate a defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, as
guaranteed by article I, §§5 and 14 of the Hawaii constitution; a proper
elements instruction, which sets forth the alternative states of mind
prescribed by the &quot;intent to defraud&quot; component of second degree
theft by shoplifting, does not violate defendant's constitutional right.  101
H. 389, 69 P.3d 517.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Shambles and temporary absence not abandonment sufficient to
deprive structure of use as a dwelling; a structure, although unoccupied does
not become abandoned unless it is &quot;wholly forsaken or deserted;&quot;
unoccupied house does not cease to be a &quot;dwelling&quot; because of the
temporary absence of the owner.  2 H. App. 581, 637 P.2d 782.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Nightclub owner's bedroom and bath in separately secured area
of club constituted a &quot;building&quot; within the meaning of this section.  9
H. App. 307, 837 P.2d 1308.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Once erected, a tent is a structure, and thus, a building.  9
H. App. 368, 842 P.2d 267.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In prosecution for first degree burglary under §708-810,
prosecution satisfied its burden of proving that storage shed was in a garage
that was part of a building that was a dwelling.  86 H. 143 (App.), 948 P.2d
564.</p>
