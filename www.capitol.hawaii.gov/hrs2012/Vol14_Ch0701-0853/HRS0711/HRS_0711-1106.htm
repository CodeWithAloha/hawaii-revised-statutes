<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1106</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Harassment, a petty misdemeanor, is a form of disorderly
conduct aimed at a single person, rather than at the public.  The intent to
harass, annoy, or alarm another person must be proved.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (1)(a) is a restatement of the common-law crime of
battery, which was committed by any slight touching of another person in a
manner which is known to be offensive to that person.  Such contacts are
prohibited, if done with requisite intent, in order to preserve the peace.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (1)(b) is likewise aimed at preserving peace.  It
prohibits insults, taunts, or challenges which are likely to provoke a violent
or disorderly response.  This is distinguished from disorderly conduct because
it does not present a risk of public inconvenience or alarm.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsections (1)(c) and (1)(d) are aimed at abusive
communications.  The former prohibits any telephone call which is made with the
specified intent and without any legitimate purpose.  The latter prohibits any
type of repeated communications which are anonymous, made at extremely
inconvenient times, or in offensively coarse language.  Again, the intent to
harass, annoy, or alarm must be proved.  Nearly all states have statutes prohibiting
such conduct.  Our aim is to make them broad enough to cover all types of
potentially annoying communications.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law treated various forms of harassment as
disorderly conduct.[1]  In addition the law expressly prohibited the use of
obscene or lascivious language over the telephone.[2]</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §711-1106</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 136, Session Laws 1973, deleted former subsection (1)(e)
from this section.  That subsection included as the offense of harassment the
case where a person &quot;engages in any other course of harmful or seriously
distressing conduct serving no legitimate purpose of the defendant.&quot;  The
Legislature felt that the subsection was overly vague.  House Standing
Committee Report No. 726.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 292, Session Laws 1992, amended this section to
strengthen the laws against harassment by providing greater protection to
victims of harassment while at the same time preserving the rights of citizens
to engage in political expression and ordinary communication.  Conference Committee
Report No. 57.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 245, Session Laws 1996, amended subsection (1) by: 
prohibiting a person from repeatedly making telephone calls, facsimile, or
electronic mail transmissions without purpose of legitimate communication;
deleting the requirement that various kinds of communications cause the
recipient to reasonably believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury
or property damage; and making it a separate offense to make a communication
using offensively coarse language that would cause the recipient to reasonably
believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury or property damage. 
Conference Committee Report No. 34.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 90, Session Laws 2009, amended subsection (1) by
including any form of electronic communication within the scope of the
offense.  The legislature found that harassing or insulting electronic
communications are a form of harassment that can be just as severe or punishing
as other verbal communications or offensive contacts.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 1242, Conference Committee Report No. 10.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant police officer and defendant resident manager had
probable cause to arrest plaintiff for harassment.  855 F. Supp. 1167.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Elements of harassment construed.  60 H. 540, 592 P.2d 810.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Threatening and offensive remarks directed against police
afforded police probable cause to arrest for harassment.  61 H. 291, 602 P.2d
933.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Harassment is not a lesser included offense of assault in the
third degree in violation of §707-712.  63 H. 1, 620 P.2d 250.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Harassment not a lesser included offense of disorderly
conduct.  63 H. 548, 632 P.2d 654.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Person charged with petty misdemeanor carrying maximum
penalty of thirty days confinement, a fine, or both, is not entitled to jury
trial.  64 H. 374, 641 P.2d 978.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where minor's challenge to officer was not uttered in a
manner likely to provoke a violent response on officer's part, there was
insufficient evidence to support district family court's conclusion that minor
committed offense of harassment in violation of subsection (1)(b).  76 H. 85,
869 P.2d 1304.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because the broad language of §708-810 does not evidence an
intent to confine crimes &quot;against a person&quot; to those enumerated in
chapter 707, and harassment is a crime against a person, a conviction for burglary
under §708-810 may be predicated on the offense of harassment.  89 H. 284, 972
P.2d 287.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  An &quot;illegitimate purpose&quot; is not an element of the
offense of harassment, as defined by subsection (1)(a); where substantial
evidence that, after becoming angry and &quot;yelling&quot; at son, defendant
slapped son in the face, trial court could reasonably have inferred that
defendant intended defendant's conduct to &quot;annoy&quot; or
&quot;alarm&quot; son.  90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Conviction reversed where defendant merely drove his automobile
along narrow street in opposite direction from automobile of former girlfriend
and did not insult, taunt, or challenge.  7 H. App. 582, 788 P.2d 173.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Record did not support a finding that defendant either
insulted, taunted, or challenged dog owner, or that defendant did so in a
manner likely to provoke a violent response.  77 H. 196 (App.), 881 P.2d 1264.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant came up behind victim unexpectedly and
threatened victim, screamed a 10-minute tirade at victim, and were actions
taken without significant provocation or cognizable justification, facts
sufficient to enable a reasonable person to conclude defendant violated
subsection (1)(b).  93 H. 513 (App.), 6 P.3d 385.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's conviction under this section vacated where trial
court's ruling that defendant engaged in &quot;reckless&quot; conduct did not
satisfy the specific intent requirement of this section.  95 H. 290 (App.), 22
P.3d 86.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the plain meaning of subsection (1)(a), &quot;offensive
physical contact&quot; encompassed the conduct of defendant knocking off police
officer's hat--offensive contact that, while separate and apart from the
various forms of actual bodily touching, nevertheless involved contact with an
item physically appurtenant to the body.  95 H. 290 (App.), 22 P.3d 86.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sufficient evidence supported trial court's finding that
defendant committed offense of harassment.  98 H. 459 (App.), 50 P.3d 428.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's conviction of harassment under this section
reversed where trial court erroneously concluded that father's actions could
not be seen as reasonably necessary to protect the welfare of the recipient,
and the State failed its burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt the
justification evidence that was adduced, or proving  beyond a reasonable doubt
facts negativing the justification defense under §703-309.  106 H. 252 (App.),
103 P.3d 412.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Mentioned:  9 H. App. 315, 837 P.2d 1313; 79 H. 538 (App.),
904 P.2d 552.</p>
