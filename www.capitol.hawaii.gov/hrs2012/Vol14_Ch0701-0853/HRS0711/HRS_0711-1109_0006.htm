hoarding.</span></b><span style='color:black'>  <i>[Section repealed on July 1,
2015.  L 2011, c 149, §6.]</i>  (1)  A person commits the offense of animal
hoarding if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly:</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   Possesses more than fifteen dogs, cats, or a
combination of dogs and cats;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Fails to provide necessary sustenance for each

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   Fails to correct the conditions under which the
dogs or cats are living, where conditions injurious to the dogs', cats', or
owner's health and well-being result from the person's failure to provide
necessary sustenance.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Animal hoarding is a misdemeanor. [L 2008,
c 128, §§1, 7; am L 2009, c 160, §§2, 3]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §§711-1109 TO 1110</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended §711-1109 to provide that
depriving pet animals of necessary sustenance constitutes the crime of cruelty
to animals.  The legislature noted that the statute identified only those acts
which were the most heinous and extreme, such as beating, mutilation,
poisoning, starvation, and torture.  However, on a daily basis, other less
overt acts such as daily neglect also resulted in the inhumane treatment of
animals.  Thus, the legislature agreed that pet animals deserved a minimum
level of care including adequate food, water, and shelter.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 3222, Conference Committee Report No. 87.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 192, Session Laws 1986, amended §711-1109 to provide that
the intentional, knowing, or reckless poisoning of an animal, except insects
and vermin, constitutes the offense of cruelty to animals.  The prohibition was
enacted in light of the increasing incidences of paraquat poisoning of animals
and because of the uncertainty of whether the present law applied to such
acts.  House Conference Committee Report No. 37-86, Senate Conference Committee
Report No. 27-86, and House Standing Committee Report No. 392.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 711-1109.3 was added by Act 129, Session Laws 1983,
to prohibit the practice of dog fighting and its related activities.  While
those activities could be prosecuted under §711-1109, the legislature felt the
need to impose a more severe sanction than the misdemeanor penalty imposed in
that section.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 347, House Standing
Committee Report No. 1054.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 259, Session Laws 2002, added §§711-1109.4 and
711-1109.5, creating criminal offenses for causing injury or death to a guide
dog, signal dog, or service animal, and for intentional interference with the
use of a guide dog, signal dog, or service animal.  Act 259 recognized the unique
skills of guide dogs, signal dogs, and service animals that have completed
lengthy and specialized training to serve their owners with disabilities.  The
dogs have become the object of taunting and injury from people or from other
dogs.  Conference Committee Report No. 58-02.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 239, Session Laws 2006, added §§711-1109.1 and
711-1109.2, allowing:  (1) law enforcement officers to enter premises and
impound a pet animal when there is probable cause to believe the pet animal is
being subjected to cruel treatment; and (2) a court to order the forfeiture of
an impounded pet animal prior to the disposition of a criminal action against
the pet animal's owner.  The forfeiture was intended to pay for the animal's
care, not to punish the owner.  Act 239 provided a way to implement the legal
principle that, despite the impoundment, the obligation to provide adequate
care for the pet animal remains with the owner.  Conference Committee Report
No. 6-06, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2592.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 114, Session Laws 2007, strengthened Hawaii's animal
cruelty laws.  Act 114 amended §711-1109 by making conduct against any animal
resulting in substantial bodily injury a misdemeanor.  Act 114 also amended
§§711-1109.1 and 711-1109.2 by conforming the forfeiture provisions to apply to
the felony prohibitions of the Act.  Act 114 created the offense of cruelty to
animals in the first degree, making it a felony to intentionally or knowingly
torture, mutilate, or poison or cause the torture, mutilation, or poisoning of
any pet animal resulting in serious bodily injury or death of the pet animal. 
The legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must be
not tolerated in our society. Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse and
the commission of violent acts against humans.  Hawaii is only one of nine
states in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal
abuse.  The legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional
bond and relationship with their owners and family members and friends. 
Violence and harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional
impact on their owners and family.  The felony provisions of Act 114 protected
pet animals. Conference Committee Report No. 29.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 128, Session Laws 2008, added §711-1109.6, criminalizing
animal hoarding as a misdemeanor.  Act 128 was in response to recent incidences
of the keeping of a large number of animals, typically dogs and cats, without
providing adequate care to the animals.  The legislature found that animal
hoarding is an under-recognized community problem affecting both human and
animal welfare.  Act 128 sunsets on July 1, 2011.  Conference Committee Report
No. 45-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 128, Session Laws 2008, criminalized animal hoarding as a
misdemeanor in §711-1109.6, and made conforming amendments to §§711-1109.1 and
711-1109.2.  Act 128 sunsets on July 1, 2011.  Conference Committee Report No.
45-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 11, Session Laws 2009, provided for the reenactment of
§§711-1109.1(1) and 711-1109.2(1), (3), and (5) upon the repeal of Act 128,
Session Laws 2008.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 160, Session Laws 2009, amended §711-1109(1) and (2) to
clarify the offense of cruelty to animals in the second degree by including
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly:  (1) confining or causing to be
confined, in a kennel or cage, any pet animal in a cruel or inhumane manner; or
(2) tethering, fastening, tying, or restraining a dog to a doghouse, tree,
fence, or any other stationary object by means of a choke collar, pinch collar,
or prong collar; provided that a person is not prohibited from using the
restraints when walking a dog with a handheld leash or while a dog is engaged
in a supervised activity.  Conference Committee Report No. 85.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 160, Session Laws 2009, amended §711-1109.6(1) by
decreasing from [&quot;more than twenty&quot;] to &quot;more than
fifteen&quot;, the number of dogs, cats, or combination of dogs and cats
required to be possessed for the animal hoarding statute to apply.  Conference
Committee Report No. 85, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 590.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 160, Session Laws 2009, also extended the sunset date of
Act 128, Session Laws 2008, relating to animal hoarding, [affecting
§§711-1109.6, 711-1109.1, and 711-1109.2,] from July 1, 2011 to July 1, 2015. 
Conference Committee Report No. 85.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 149, Session Laws 2011, created a new offense,
§711-1109.35, cruelty to animals by fighting dogs in the second degree, a class
C felony.  Act 149 amended §711-1109.3 by converting the existing offense to
cruelty to animals by fighting dogs in the first degree, clarifying the
elements of the offense, and increasing the penalty from a class C felony to a
class B felony.  Act 149 also amended §§711-1109.1(1) and 711-1109.2(1), (3),
and (5) by adding cruelty to animals by fighting dogs to the offenses for which
a dog may be impounded or forfeited.  The legislature found that dogfighting is
a brutal practice which often results in the death of the participating dogs
within hours or days after the fight.  Also, because dogs used for fighting
have been bred for generations to be dangerously aggressive toward other
animals, the presence of the dogs in a community increases the risk of attacks
on not only other animals, but potentially on children, whose small size may
cause a fighting dog to perceive a child as another animal.  Hawaii ranked
fiftieth in a recent national ranking of the weakest state dogfighting laws,
primarily because Hawaii lacked a penalty for attending or wagering on an
organized dogfight.  Act 149 was intended to address the demand for dogfighting,
in an attempt to deter the callous practice.  Act 149 also specifically
prohibited the use of other animals as bait to train fighting dogs.  Bait
animals are often stolen animals, stray pets, or animals obtained through
advertisements that offer pets free to a good home.  Senate Standing Committee
Report No. 562, House Standing Committee Report No. 1098.</p>

<p class=XNotes>    Act 149, Session Laws 2011, also provided for the
reenactment of §§711-1109.1(1) and  711-1109.2(1), (3), and (5) upon the repeal
of Act 128, Session Laws 2008, as amended by Act 160, Session Laws 2009.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 175, Session Laws 2011, amended §§711-1109.4 and
711-1109.5 to conform to the definition of &quot;service dog&quot; established
in chapter 347 by the Act.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1497.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 226, Session Laws 2011, amended §711-1109(1) by requiring
that any handling or extermination of insects, vermin, or other pests be
conducted in accordance with standard and acceptable pest control practices and
all applicable laws and regulations.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1300.</p>
