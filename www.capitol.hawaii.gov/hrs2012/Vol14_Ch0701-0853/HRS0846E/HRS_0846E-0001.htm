<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Effect of 2011 Amendment</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>     L 2011, c 125, §4 provides:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;SECTION 4.  This Act [amending
sections 846E-1 and 846E-10] shall take effect on July 1, 2011; provided that
consistent with the definition of &quot;sex offender&quot; as provided in
section 846E-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, this Act shall apply retroactively to
any person who is or was:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Convicted at any time of a violation of privacy
in the first degree under section 711-1110.9, Hawaii Revised Statutes; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Charged at any time with a violation of privacy
in the first degree under section 711-1110.9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
currently or was previously found unfit to proceed against the charges, and is
currently or was previously released into the community or who is currently or
was previously acquitted due to a physical or mental disease, disorder, or
defect pursuant to chapter 704, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and is currently or
was previously released into the community.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Indecent exposure, in violation of §707-734, does not
constitute an offense that entails &quot;criminal sexual conduct&quot; and,
consequently, persons convicted of indecent exposure are not &quot;sex
offenders&quot; for purposes of this chapter; thus, defendant was not required
to register as a &quot;sex offender&quot; pursuant to this chapter.  102 H.
383, 76 P.3d 935.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under article I, §5, of the Hawaii constitution, due process
requires that a convicted sex offender under this section be afforded the right
to a judicial hearing at which evidence may be offered to demonstrate that
continuance of all or part of the lifetime registration requirements are not
necessary in a particular case to fulfill the public need to which the sex
offender act responded.  105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where it was not necessary for defendant to actually commit
one of the felony offenses defined in this section in order to violate the
prohibition against the electronic enticement of a child under §707-756(1) but
only necessary under §707-756(1)(b)(iii) that defendant act with the intent to
promote or facilitate the commission of a felony offense defined in this
section, the State was not required to specify in the indictment which felony
offense defined in this section that defendant intended to promote or
facilitate.  120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3. </p>
