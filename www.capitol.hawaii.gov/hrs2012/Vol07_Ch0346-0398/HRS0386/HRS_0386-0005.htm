else entitled to recover damages from the employer, at common law or otherwise,
on account of the injury, except for sexual harassment or sexual assault and
infliction of emotional distress or invasion of privacy related thereto, in

director or appeals board.  89 H. 411, 974 P.2d 51.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff's claims did not arise under this chapter,
the exclusive remedy and original jurisdiction provisions in the workers'
compensation statute did not apply, and where plaintiff's claims for relief of
tortious conduct on the part of workers' compensation insurer were not within
the original jurisdiction of the labor director, trial court erred in granting
summary judgment on that basis.  90 H. 407, 978 P.2d 845.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where law firm's actions as an employer and law firm were not
inconsistent and law firm's status as an employer and law firm involved a
single legal entity for purposes of the &quot;dual persona&quot; doctrine,
trial court did not err in granting law firm's motion to dismiss terminated
attorney's negligent investigation claim.  117 H. 92, 176 P.3d 91.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where this section unambiguously provides that claims for
infliction of emotional distress or invasion of privacy are not subject to the
exclusivity provision when such claims arise from claims for sexual harassment
or sexual assault, in which case a civil action may be brought, and plaintiff
alleged a claim for emotional distress (negligent investigation) that did not
arise out of sexual harassment or sexual assault, such claim was, pursuant to
this section, barred.  117 H. 92, 176 P.3d 91.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section does not bar a child from bringing a tort action
against mother's employer for in utero injuries child personally sustained,
allegedly as a result of a work-related accident involving the mother.  91 H.
157 (App.), 981 P.2d 714.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where record revealed that the parties disputed at least two
material facts--whose work was being done by plaintiff when plaintiff was
injured and who controlled plaintiff's work at the job site--defendant failed
to produce evidence that defendant was a &quot;statutory employer&quot; for
workers' compensation purposes; thus, circuit court erred in granting summary
judgment to defendant because defendant had not demonstrated that it was immune
from suit and was therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  124 H.
230 (App.), 239 P.3d 1280.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Cited:  23 H. 291, 294; 56 H. 544, 545 P.2d 687.</p>
