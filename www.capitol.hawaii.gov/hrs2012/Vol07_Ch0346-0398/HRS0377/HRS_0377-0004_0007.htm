initial collective bargaining agreements.</b>  (a)  No later than ten days
after receiving a written request for collective bargaining from an individual
or labor organization that has been newly organized or certified as a
representative, the parties shall meet and commence to bargain collectively and
shall make every reasonable effort to conclude and sign a collective bargaining
agreement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If, after the expiration of the ninety-day
period beginning on the date on which bargaining commenced, or such additional
period as the parties may agree upon, the parties have failed to reach an
agreement, either party may notify the board of the existence of a dispute and
request conciliation under section 377-3.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If, after the expiration of the twenty-day
period beginning on the date on which the request for conciliation is made
under subsection (b), or such additional period as the parties may agree upon,
the conciliator is not able to bring the parties to agreement by conciliation, the
board shall refer the dispute to an arbitration panel established in accordance
with section 89-11(e)(2)(A) and rules as may be prescribed by the board.  The
arbitration panel shall render a decision settling the dispute, and the
decision shall be binding upon the parties for a period of two years, unless
amended during that period by written consent of the parties. [L Sp 2009, c 6,
