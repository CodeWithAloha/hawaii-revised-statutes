<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Broker-dealer records required to be maintained
under paragraph (1) may be maintained in any form of data storage acceptable

if they are readily accessible to the commissioner; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Investment adviser records required to be

required by rule adopted or order issued under this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The records of a broker-dealer registered

chapter require a minimum<b> </b>capital requirement for registered
broker-dealers, which shall not be less than $5,000 in the case of
