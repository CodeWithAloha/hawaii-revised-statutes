<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§302B-3.6]  Occupancy and use of facilities
of public schools. </b> (a)  When the department considers whether to close any
particular public school, the department shall submit a notice of possible
availability of a public school or notice of vacancy of a public school to the
charter school review panel pursuant to section 302A-1151.5(b); provided that
the department has not elected to use the public school to support education
programs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If a charter school exclusively or jointly
occupies or uses buildings or facilities of a public school immediately prior
to converting to a charter school, upon conversion that charter school shall be
given continued exclusive or joint use of the buildings or facilities; provided
that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The State may reclaim some or all of the
buildings or facilities if it demonstrates a tangible and imperative need for
such reclamation;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The State and the conversion charter school
voluntarily enter into an agreement detailing the portion of those buildings or
facilities that shall be reclaimed by the State and a timetable for the
reclamation.  If a timetable cannot be reached, the State may petition the
panel for the reclamation, and the panel may grant the petition only to the
extent that is not possible for the conversion charter school and the
department to jointly occupy or use the buildings or facilities.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Upon receipt of a notice pursuant to
section 302A-1151.5(b), the panel shall solicit applications from charter
schools interested in using and occupying all or portions of the facilities of
the public school by:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Promptly notifying all charter schools that the
public school is being considered for closure; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Affording each charter school an opportunity to
submit an application with a written explanation and justification of why the
charter school should be considered for possible occupancy and use of the
facilities of the public school.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  After fully considering each charter
school's application and based on the applications received and on other
considerations, the panel shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Provide a written response to each charter
school's application after each application has been fully considered; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Compile a prioritized list of charter schools and
submit the list to the department for final determination of which charter
school, if any, shall be authorized to use and occupy the public school
facilities.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Upon the selection of a charter school to
use a vacant school facility or portion of a school facility, the department
and the panel shall enter into necessary agreements within ninety days of the
selection to carry out the purposes of this section; provided that any
agreement between the panel and the department shall stipulate that a charter
school that uses and occupies a public school facility or portion of a public
school facility shall be responsible for the full or pro rata share of the
repair and maintenance costs for that facility or portion of the facility, as
the case may be.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  T<span style='background:white'>he panel
shall adopt </span>policies and procedures <span style='background:white'>necessary
to carry out the purposes of this section</span>, including but not limited to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Procedures for charter schools to apply in
writing to use vacant school facilities;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Criteria for the panel to use in determining
which charter schools to include on the prioritized list to be submitted to the
department; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Procedures for the panel to notify charter school
applicants that are granted or denied the use of vacant school facilities.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  For purposes of this section, &quot;public
school&quot; means any school that falls within the definition of public
schools in section 302A-101, except for charter schools. [L 2010, c 144, §3]</p>
