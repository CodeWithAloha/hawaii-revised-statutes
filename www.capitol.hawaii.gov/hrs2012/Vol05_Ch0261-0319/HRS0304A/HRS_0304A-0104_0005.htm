<p class=XNotesHeading>Revision Note</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;May 1, 2007&quot; substituted for &quot;the effective
date of this Act&quot;.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The governor's nondiscretionary duty--pursuant to the Hawaii
constitution, article X, §6, subsection (e), and §304A-104(a)--to nominate and
appoint members of the board of regents of the University of Hawaii, is subject
to a reasonable time standard; reasonable time is judged by the totality of the
circumstances; the passage of nearly ten months since the governor was
presented with the regent candidate list was an unreasonable period of time for
the governor to perform this constitutional and statutory duty and the governor
was thus subject to mandamus.  119 H. 341, 198 P.3d 604.</p>
