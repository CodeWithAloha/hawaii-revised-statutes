fees. </b> (a)  Any person: </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Eighteen years of age or over; </p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Who has a diploma or proper certificate of
graduation from a dental hygiene school accredited by the American Dental
Association Commission on Dental Accreditation that requires at least a two
year course and is recognized by the board of dental examiners;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Who has been officially certified in the
administration of intra-oral infiltration local anesthesia and intra-oral block
anesthesia by an accredited dental hygiene school or by a certification program
previously approved by the board; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Who has passed the National Board Dental Hygiene
Examination;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>upon written application made to and filed with the
board may be examined for qualification as a dental hygienist. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     An application shall be accompanied by the
applicant's certificate of graduation from an accredited dental hygiene school,
documentary proof of the applicant's certification in the administration of
intra-oral infiltration local anesthesia and intra-oral block anesthesia, and
documentary proof of the applicant's passage of the National Board Dental
Hygiene Examination.  At the time of filing the application, the applicant
shall pay to the board an application fee, which together with all other fees
or charges in this chapter, shall be as provided in rules adopted by the
director of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant to chapter 91, and shall be
deposited to the credit of the compliance resolution fund established pursuant
to section 26-9(o). </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The board shall require an applicant to
take and pass the State's examination or one of the following four regional

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  In addition to the requirements of
subsection (a), an applicant shall take and pass a national clinical examination
once a national clinical examination becomes available and neither the state

applicant who has taken and passed the state or a regional examination after
February 1, 2005, but prior to the availability of a national examination shall
be deemed to have met the board's examination requirement. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If an applicant successfully passes the
examination required by subsections (b) and (c), the applicant shall be

block anesthesia categories in which the applicant or licensed dental hygienist
has acquired knowledge and proficiency. </p>

shall submit documentation of course content when submitting certification in
the administration of intra-oral infiltration local anesthesia and intra-oral
block anesthesia as required by subsection (a).  The board shall certify that
the applicant or licensed dental hygienist has met the requirements of this
chapter. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  No person shall practice dental hygiene,
either gratuitously or for pay, or shall offer or attempt so to practice, or
shall advertise or announce publicly or privately as being prepared or
qualified so to practice without having a license as provided in this section. 
A licensed dental hygienist shall practice only under the supervision of a
licensed dentist as provided in this chapter; provided that a licensed dental
hygienist shall administer under the direct supervision of a licensed dentist
only those categories of intra-oral block anesthesia listed in the course content
submitted to the board pursuant to subsection (a). [L 1920, c 7, §1; am L 1923,
