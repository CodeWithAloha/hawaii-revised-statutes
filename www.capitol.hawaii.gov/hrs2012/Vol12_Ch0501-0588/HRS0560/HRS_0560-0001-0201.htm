<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellant was not an &quot;interested person&quot;, as
defined in this section, who could petition the court under §560:3-614 for
appointment as special administrator where appellant had no familial
relationship to decedent's family, did not have a property right or claim
against decedent's estate, and did not have priority under §560:3-203 to be
appointed as personal representative of decedent's estate; circuit court thus
properly denied appellant's petition.  88 H. 148, 963 P.2d 1124.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The term &quot;interested person&quot; as defined in this
section does not include a party interested solely in challenging a closure
order in a probate proceeding; where appellants did not &quot;possess an
interest in the estate itself&quot; nor were trustees, heirs, devisees,
children, spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, creditors, or beneficiaries,
trial court correctly denied appellant media's petition to intervene as
&quot;interested persons&quot;.  106 H. 453, 106 P.3d 1096.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Current income beneficiary of trust lacked standing to
participate in matter concerning the distribution of the corpus upon
termination of the trust where income beneficiary did not have any interest in
the estate that would be affected by the particular probate proceeding inasmuch
as income beneficiary was merely a measuring life and not a residuary
beneficiary, and income beneficiary's interest was not a property right in or
claim against the estate.  109 H. 502, 128 P.3d 815.</p>
