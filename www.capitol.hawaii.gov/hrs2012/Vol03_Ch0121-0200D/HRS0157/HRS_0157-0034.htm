<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§157-34  Determination of quotas.  </b>(a) 
To promote a proper balance between supply and demand for milk, the board shall
provide that the price to be paid to producers shall be based upon quota
assigned each producer by the board, which quota shall be determined as
follows:  upon petition or chairperson's motion as set out in section 157-31,
there shall be established an initial quota for each producer and
producer-distributor, which shall be the average of the amount of milk that the
producer or producer-distributor produced and delivered during the three-year
period prior to January 1, 1967; provided that if a producer or
producer-distributor had not been in business for such period, the board may
also take into account the producer's or producer-distributor's prior
production, contract and the producer's or producer-distributor's investment;
and provided further that in any milk shed established subsequent to January 1,
1971, the board shall establish an initial quota for each producer and
producer-distributor which shall be the average of the amount of milk that the
producer or producer-distributor produced and delivered during the twelve-month
period immediately prior to the date of petition or chairperson's motion, and
may also take into account prior production, contract and investment factors
where any of the producers or producer-distributors shall not have been in
business for such twelve-month period.  The board shall set the initial quota
of a newly licensed producer or producer-distributor entering the market by
taking into account all relevant market conditions and the capabilities of the
licensee.  The board may adjust the initial quotas on a pro rata basis to meet
changes in market requirements.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  For each milk shed in which quota control
or price control or both is to be established, producers or
producer-distributors whose dairies are located outside such milk shed shall
participate in said quota control or price control, or both, for milk regularly
supplied within the affected milk shed.  However, in setting the minimum price
for the milk the board shall consider only those costs incurred by producers
located within the affected milk shed.  Any milk delivered and utilized in a
milk shed shall be subject to all the provisions and regulations applicable to
that milk shed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  When the amount of milk resold for human
consumption as fluid milk does not exceed the sum of the quotas to be regularly
supplied a distributor or producer-distributor, such fluid consumption milk
shall be deemed taken ratably from the quotas actually supplied, and payment
shall be made accordingly.  The board shall determine which producers, not
under written contract with a distributor or producer-distributor, are regular
suppliers of milk.  The remaining milk not used for human fluid consumption
shall be paid for according to its use.  However, when the producer-distributor
or distributor resells milk, other than recombined or reconstituted milk, for
fluid consumption in an amount in excess of all quotas assigned producers or
producer-distributors regularly supplying the producer-distributor or
distributor milk, then the fluid consumption prices shall apply pro rata to
surplus milk, in the ratio that a producer's quota bears to the sum of the
quotas.  However, whenever there is quota milk available for purchase within
the milk shed, surplus milk may not be used as milk to be resold for human
consumption as fluid milk.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  From time to time when required to meet
changes in conditions, the board may alter, revise, or adjust the total quota
in any milk shed by rule, pursuant to section 157-31(a)(1), or by order,
without regard for the notice and public hearing requirements of chapter 91,
based on [the] specific formulas or criteria adopted under section
157-31(a)(2).  An order to alter, revise, or adjust the total quota for the
production of milk in a milk shed shall be subject to the notice requirements
set forth in sections 157-33(a)(1) and 157-33(a)(2) for an order fixing minimum
prices or salvage values.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The board may adopt rules governing the
transfer of quotas. [L 1967, c 260, §23; HRS §157-34; am L 1971, c 184, pt of
§4; ree and am L 1972, c 40, pt of §2; gen ch 1985, 1993; am L 1997, c 118,
§§4, 6; am L 1998, c 19, §1; am L 2008, c 46, §3]</p>
