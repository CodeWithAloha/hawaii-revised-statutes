<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§431:19-108  Examinations and
investigations.</b>  (a)  The commissioner or any authorized examiner may
conduct an examination of any captive insurance company as often as the
commissioner deems appropriate, provided that unless the commissioner requires
otherwise:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  An examination shall be conducted at least once
every five years for all captive insurance companies, except as provided in
paragraph (2); and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  An examination of a class 3 risk retention
captive insurance company shall be conducted no later than three years after
its formation and at least once every five years thereafter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The commissioner or any authorized examiner
shall thoroughly inspect and examine the captive insurance company's affairs to
ascertain its financial condition, its ability to fulfill its obligations, and
whether it has complied with this article.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The powers, authorities, and duties
relating to examinations vested in and imposed upon the commissioner under
section 431:2-301 through section 431:2-307.5 of the code are extended to and
imposed upon the commissioner in respect to examinations of captive insurance
companies.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  All examination reports, preliminary
examination reports or results, working papers, recorded information,
documents, and copies thereof produced by, obtained by, or disclosed to the
commissioner or any person in the course of an examination made under this
section are confidential and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made
public by the commissioner or an employee or agent of the commissioner without
the written consent of the company, except to the extent provided in this
subsection.  Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the commissioner from
using information in furtherance of the commissioner's regulatory authority
under this title.  The commissioner may grant access to the information to
public officers having jurisdiction over the regulation of insurance in any
other state or country, or to law enforcement officers of this State or any
other state or agency of the federal government at any time, so long as the
officers receiving the information agree in writing to hold it in a manner
consistent with this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Each branch captive insurance company
shall file annually with the commissioner a certificate of compliance issued by
the insurance regulatory authority of the jurisdiction in which the outside
captive insurance company of the branch captive insurance company is domiciled
along with certified copies of any examination reports conducted of the outside
captive insurance company by its domiciliary insurance regulator during the
preceding calendar year.  These filings shall be made with the commissioner by
March 1 of each year.  So long as the branch captive insurance company complies
with the requirements of this subsection, and unless otherwise deemed necessary
by the commissioner, any examination of the branch captive insurance company
under this subsection shall be only with respect to the business underwritten
by the branch captive insurance company in this State.  If necessary, however,
the commissioner may examine the outside captive insurance company of any
branch captive insurance company licensed under this article. [L 1987, c 347,
pt of §2; am L 1989, c 195, §41; am L 1996, c 248, §2; am L 1999, c 7, §1 and c
