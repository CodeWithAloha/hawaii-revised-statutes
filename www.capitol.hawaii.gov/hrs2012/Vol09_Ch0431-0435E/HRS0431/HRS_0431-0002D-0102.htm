<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§431:2D-102]  Definitions.</b>  As used in
this article, unless the context indicates otherwise:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Commissioner&quot; means the insurance
commissioner of the State of Hawaii.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Complaint&quot; means a written or
documented oral communication to the insurance division primarily expressing a
grievance, meaning an expression of dissatisfaction.  For health companies, a
grievance is a written complaint submitted by or on behalf of a covered person.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Comprehensive market conduct
examination&quot; means a review of one or more lines of business of an insurer
domiciled in this State that is not conducted for cause.  The term includes a
review of rating, tier classification, underwriting, policyholder service,
claims, marketing and sales, producer licensing, complaint handling practices,
and compliance procedures and policies.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Insurance compliance audit&quot; means a
voluntary, internal evaluation, review, assessment, audit, or investigation for
the purpose of identifying or preventing noncompliance with, or promoting
compliance with laws, regulations, orders, or industry or professional
standards, which is conducted by or on behalf of an insurer, or which involves
an insurer activity regulated by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Insurance compliance self-evaluative
audit document&quot; means documents prepared as a result of or in connection
with an insurance compliance audit.  An insurance compliance self-evaluative
audit document may include a written response to the findings of an insurance
compliance audit.  An insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document may
include, but is not limited to, as applicable, field notes and records of
observations, findings, opinions, suggestions, conclusions, drafts, memoranda,
drawings, photographs, exhibits, computer generated or electronically recorded
information, telephone records, maps, charts, graphs, and surveys; provided
that this supporting information is collected or developed for the primary
purpose and in the course of an insurance compliance audit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Market analysis&quot; means a process
whereby market conduct surveillance personnel collect and analyze information
from filed schedules, surveys, required reports, and other sources to develop a
baseline and to identify patterns or practices of insurers licensed to do
business in this State that deviate significantly from the norm or that may
pose a potential risk to the insurance consumer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Market conduct action&quot; means any of
the full range of activities that the commissioner may initiate to assess the
market and practices of individual insurers, beginning with market analyses and
extending to targeted examinations.  The commissioner's activities to resolve
an individual consumer complaint or other reports of a specific instance of
misconduct are not market conduct actions for purposes of this article.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Market conduct examination&quot; means
the examination of the insurance operations of an insurer licensed to do
business in this State to evaluate compliance with the applicable laws and
rules of this State.  A market conduct examination may be either a comprehensive
examination or a targeted examination.  A market conduct examination is
separate and distinct from a financial examination of an insurer performed
pursuant to article 5, but may be conducted at the same time.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Market conduct surveillance
personnel&quot; means those individuals employed or contracted by the
commissioner to collect, analyze, review, or act on information about the
insurance marketplace, which identifies patterns or practices of insurers.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;National Association of Insurance
Commissioners&quot; means the organization of insurance regulators from the
fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the four United States territories.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Qualified contract examiner&quot; means a
person under contract to the commissioner, who is qualified by education,
experience and, where applicable, professional designations, to perform market
conduct actions.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Targeted examination&quot; means a
focused examination conducted for cause, based on the results of market
analysis indicating the need to review either a specific line of business or
specific business practices, including but not limited to underwriting and
rating, marketing and sales, complaint handling operations, advertising
materials, licensing, policyholder services, non-forfeitures, claims handling,
or policy forms and filings.  A targeted examination may be conducted by desk
examination or by an on-site examination.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Third party model or product&quot; means
a model or product provided by an entity separate from and not under direct or
indirect corporate control of the insurer using the model or product. [L 2007,
c 227, pt of §1]</p>
