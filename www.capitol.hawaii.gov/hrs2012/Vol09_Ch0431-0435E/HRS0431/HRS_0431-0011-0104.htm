<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§431:11-104  Acquisition of control or
merger with domestic insurer.  </b>(a)  No person other than the issuer shall
make a tender offer or a request or invitation for tenders, or enter into any
agreement to exchange securities, or seek to acquire, or acquire, in the open
market or otherwise, any voting security of a domestic insurer if, after the
consummation thereof, the person, directly or indirectly (by conversion or by
exercise of any right to acquire), would be in control of the insurer, and no
person shall enter into an agreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire
control of a domestic insurer or any person controlling a domestic insurer
unless, at the time any offer, request, or invitation is made or any agreement
is entered into, or prior to the acquisition of the securities if no offer or
agreement is involved, the person has filed with the commissioner and has sent
to the insurer, and the insurer has sent to its shareholders, a statement
containing the information required by subsection (b) and the offer, request,
invitation, agreement, or acquisition has been approved by the commissioner in
the manner hereinafter prescribed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     For purposes of this section, a domestic
insurer includes any person controlling a domestic insurer unless the
commissioner determines that the person, directly or through its affiliates, is
primarily engaged in business other than the business of insurance.  Such a
person shall file a preacquisition notification with the commissioner
containing the information set forth in section 431:11-104.3(b) thirty days
prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition.  Failure to file is
subject to section 431:11-104.5(f).  This section does not apply to any
securities broker holding, in the usual and customary broker's function, less
than twenty per cent of the voting securities of an insurance company or of any
person who controls an insurance company.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The statement to be filed with the
commissioner hereunder shall be made under oath or affirmation and shall
contain the following information:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The name and address of each person by whom or on
whose behalf the merger or other acquisition of control referred to in
subsection (a) is to be effected (hereinafter called &quot;acquiring
party&quot;), and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  If the person is an individual, the
principal occupation and all offices and positions held by the individual
during the past five years, and any conviction of crimes other than minor
traffic violations during the past ten years; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  If the person is not an individual, a
report of the nature of its business operations during the past five years or
for such lesser period as the person and any predecessors thereof shall have
been in existence; an informative description of the business intended to be
done by the person and the person's subsidiaries; and a list of all individuals
who are or who have been selected to become directors or executive officers of
such person, or who perform or will perform functions appropriate to the
positions.  The list shall include for each individual the information required
by [subparagraph](A);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The source, nature, and amount of the
consideration used or to be used in effecting the merger or other acquisition
of control, a description of any transaction wherein funds were or are to be
obtained for any purpose (including any pledge of the insurer's stock, or the
stock of any of its subsidiaries or controlling affiliates), and the identity
of persons furnishing the consideration; provided that where a source of the
consideration is a loan made in the lender's ordinary course of business, the
identity of the lender shall remain confidential, if the person filing the
statement requests confidentiality;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Fully audited financial information as to the
earnings and financial condition of each acquiring party for the preceding five
fiscal years (or for the lesser period as the acquiring party and any
predecessors thereof shall have been in existence), and similar unaudited
information as of a date not earlier than ninety days prior to the filing of
the statement;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Any plans or proposals which each acquiring party
may have to liquidate the insurer, to sell its assets or merge or consolidate
it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or
corporate structure or management;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The number of shares of any security referred to
in subsection (a) which each acquiring party proposes to acquire, and the terms
of the offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition referred to in
subsection (a), and a statement as to the method by which the fairness of the
proposal was arrived at;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  The amount of each class of any security referred
to in subsection (a) which is beneficially owned or concerning which there is a
right to acquire beneficial ownership by each acquiring party;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  A full description of any contracts,
arrangements, or understandings with respect to any security referred to in
subsection (a) in which any acquiring party is involved, including but not
limited to transfer of any of the securities, joint ventures, loan or option
arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of loans, guarantees against loss or
guarantees of profits, division of losses or profits, or the giving or
withholding of proxies.  The description shall identify the persons with whom
the contracts, arrangements, or understandings have been entered into;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  A description of the purchase of any security
referred to in subsection (a) during the twelve calendar months preceding the
filing of the statement, by any acquiring party, including the dates of purchase,
names of the purchasers, and considerations paid or agreed to be paid
therefore;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  A description of any recommendations to purchase
any security referred to in subsection (a) made during the twelve calendar
months preceding the filing of the statement, by any acquiring party, or by
anyone based upon interviews or at the suggestion of such acquiring party;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  Copies of all tender offers, requests, or
invitation for tenders, or exchange offers for, and agreements to acquire or
exchange any securities referred to in subsection (a), and (if distributed) of
additional soliciting material relating thereto;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  The term of any agreement, contract, or
understanding made with or proposed to be made with any broker/dealer as to
solicitation of securities referred to in subsection (a) for tender, and the
amount of any fees, commissions or other compensation to be paid to
broker/dealers with regard thereto; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (12)  Any additional information as the commissioner
may by rule or regulation prescribe as necessary or appropriate for the
protection of policyholders of the insurer or in the public interest.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>If the person required to file the statement
referred to in subsection (a) is a partnership, limited partnership, or other
group, the commissioner may require that the information called for by items
(1) through (12) shall be given with respect to each partner of the partnership
or limited partnership, each member of the group, and each person who controls
such partner or member.  If any partner, member, or person is a corporation or
the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) is a
corporation, the commissioner may require that the information called for by
items (1) through (12) shall be given with respect to the corporation, each officer
and director of the corporation, and each person who is directly or indirectly
the beneficial owner of more than ten per cent of the outstanding voting
securities of the corporation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If any material change occurs in the facts set
forth in the statement filed with the commissioner and sent to the insurer
pursuant to this section, an amendment setting forth the change, together with
copies of all documents and other material relevant to the change, shall be
filed with the commissioner and sent to the insurer within two business days
after the person learns of the change.  The insurer shall send the amendment to
its shareholders.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If any offer, request, invitation,
agreement or acquisition referred to in subsection (a) is proposed to be made
by means of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 or in
circumstances requiring the disclosure of similar information under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or under a state law requiring similar
registration or disclosure, the person required to file the statement referred
to in subsection (a) may utilize the documents in furnishing the information
called for by that statement.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (d)   (1)  The commissioner shall approve any merger or
other acquisition of control referred to in subsection (a) unless, after a
public hearing thereon, the commissioner finds that:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  After the change of control, the domestic
insurer referred to in subsection (a) would not be able to satisfy the
requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of
insurance for which it is presently licensed;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The effect of the merger or other
acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in
insurance in this State or tend to create a monopoly therein;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  The financial condition of any acquiring
party might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the
interest of its policyholders;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  The plans or proposals which the acquiring
party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it
with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or
corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders
of the insurer and not in the public interest;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  The competence, experience, and integrity
of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer would not be in
the interest of policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (F)  The acquisition is likely to be hazardous
or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The public hearing referred to in paragraph (1)
shall commence within sixty days after the statement required by subsection (a)
is filed, except that the hearing may commence within such additional time as
agreed to by the commissioner, the acquiring party and the person to be
acquired, and at least twenty days notice of the scheduled public hearing shall
be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement.  Not less than
seven days notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the
statement to the insurer and to any other persons as may be designated by the
commissioner.  The insurer shall give notice to its security holders.  The
commissioner shall make a determination within thirty days after the conclusion
of the hearing.  At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer,
any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose
interest may be affected thereby shall have the right to present evidence,
examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and
in connection therewith shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in
the same manner as is presently allowed in chapter 91.  All discovery
proceedings shall be concluded not later than three days prior to the commencement
of the public hearing.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The commissioner may retain at the acquiring
person's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not
otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as may be reasonably necessary to
assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  All statements, amendments, or other
material filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b), and all notices of public
hearings held pursuant to subsection (d), shall be mailed by the insurer to its
shareholders within five business days after the insurer has received the
statements, amendments, other material, or notices.  The expenses of mailing
shall be borne by the person making the filing.  As security for the payment of
the expenses, the person shall file with the commissioner an acceptable bond or
other deposit in an amount to be determined by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The provisions of this section shall not
apply to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Any transaction which is subject to the
provisions of article 4, dealing with the merger or consolidation of two or
more insurers; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or
acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt therefrom as:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Not having been made or entered into for
the purpose of, and not having the effect of, changing or influencing the
control of a domestic insurer; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Not otherwise comprehended within the
purposes of this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The following shall be violations of this
article:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The failure to file any statement, amendment, or
other material required to be filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b); or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an
acquisition of, control of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless approval
is given by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The courts of this State are hereby vested
with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled or authorized to do
business in this State who files a statement with the commissioner under this
section, and overall actions involving the person arising out of violations of
this article.  Each person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to
and constituting an appointment by the person of the commissioner to be the
person's true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in
any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of violations of this article. 
Copies of all lawful process shall be served on the commissioner and
transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to the person
at the person's last known address. [L 1987, c 349, pt of §8; am L 1989, c 195,
