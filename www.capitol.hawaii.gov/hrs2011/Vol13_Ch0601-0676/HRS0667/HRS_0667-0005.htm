The attorney shall:</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     </span><span lang=X-NONE>(1)</span><span

rules of civil procedure; provided that in the case of nonjudicial foreclosure
of a lien by an association against a mortgagor who is not an owner-occupant,

known or can be discovered by the association; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  By publication of the notice once in each
of three successive weeks, constituting three publications with the last
publication to be not less than fourteen days before the day of sale, in a
daily newspaper having the largest general circulation in the specific county
in which the mortgaged property lies; provided that for property located in a
county with a population of more than one hundred thousand but less than three
hundred thousand, the public notice shall be published in the newspaper having
the largest circulation expressly in the eastern or western half of the county,
corresponding to the location of the subject property;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Mortgagee in exercising power must not oppress debtor or
sacrifice the estate.  5 H. 262.  As to duty to sell in parcels, see 17 H. 49. 
Foreclosure not barred because statute of limitations has run against note but
no deficiency judgment can be entered.  17 H. 49; 20 H. 620.  Foreclosure
barred, by analogy, by statute applicable to real actions.  15 H. 507. 
Ejectment and not bill in equity proper remedy for purchaser at sale under
power, to obtain possession.  14 H. 515.  Mere filing of bankruptcy petition
between date of publication and date of sale does not invalidate sale but
bankruptcy court may enjoin sale.  7 F.2d 576.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff-appellant challenged this statute as violating the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; district court's dismissal of
the case for failure to state a claim because the sale was a purely private
remedy and involved no state action, affirmed.  324 F.3d 1091.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Acts to be done by mortgagee not required to be done
personally.  8 H. 108.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Publication in Hawaiian no longer required.  22 H. 183.</p>

<p class=XNotes>Constitutionality.  17 H. 49; 17 H. 528, 534.  Validity of
sale; provisions of power of sale must be followed.  5 H. 262; 17 H. 49. 
Redemption; no statute authorizes redemption after sale, and hence no right of
redemption exists.  15 H. 271.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Chattel mortgages, duty to obtain best price.  35 H. 158.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  An agreement created at a foreclosure sale conducted pursuant
to this section is void and unenforceable where the foreclosure sale is invalid
under the statute; the high bidder at such a sale is entitled only to return of
his or her downpayment plus accrued interest.  121 H. 287, 218 P.3d 775.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where, at the time of the foreclosure sale, mortgagors were
no longer in default and, thus, were no longer in breach of a condition of the
mortgage, and without such breach, defendant could not invoke the mortgage's
power of sale clause, the subsequent foreclosure sale did not comply with the
requirements of this section and was, thus, invalid.  121 H. 287, 218 P.3d 775.</p>
