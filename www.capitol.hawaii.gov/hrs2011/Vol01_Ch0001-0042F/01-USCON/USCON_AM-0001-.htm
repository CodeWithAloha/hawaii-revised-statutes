I.--1791]</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of
grievances.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Statute which would include newspapers within definition of
public utility and subject them to PUC jurisdiction would be violative of
freedom of the press.  Att. Gen. Op. 74-11.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Licensing of church-sponsored day care programs
constitutional.  Att. Gen. Op. 85-25.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 445-112(11), regulating political signs, was
unconstitutional and unenforceable.  Att. Gen. Op. 96-4.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 452-23(a)(4), (5), and (6) was overly broad and
infringed upon commercial speech rights afforded by First Amendment.  Att. Gen.
Op. 98-2.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 11-204(b): violates First Amendment because it
restricts persons or other entities from making contributions to noncandidate
ballot measure committees.  Section 11-204(j):  statutory provision prohibits
contributions based upon length of time that noncandidate committee has been
registered; this durational requirement is unconstitutional because it imposes
limitations on the right of association and the right of expression when
contributions are made to noncandidate committees.  Att. Gen. Op. 98-5.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, in which the U.S. Supreme Court
held that an Ohio school voucher program did not violate the establishment
clause, was inapposite in Hawaii; a publicly-funded Hawaii school voucher
program would violate article X, §1 of the state constitution.  Att. Gen. Op.
03-1.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Generally.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  State's ban on write-in voting does not unreasonably infringe
upon voters' constitutional rights.  504 U.S. 428.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Military bases are at least one location in which First
Amendment restrictions are permissible.  582 F.2d 1194.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  If government creates a public forum, even though under no
duty to do so, its power to exclude expression is severely limited.  710 F.2d
1410.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Recalled officials likely to succeed on claim that two-year
ban on their election to office is unconstitutional.  775 F.2d 1393.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 11-216(d)'s prohibition on complainant publicly
disclosing that complaint was filed with campaign spending commission and on
other disclosures by third parties unconstitutionally overbroad.  30 F.3d 1115.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Prison officials entitled to 42 U.S.C. §1983 qualified
immunity from inmate's claim of retaliatory punishment for exercising inmate's
First Amendment rights where reasonable prison official would have believed
that inmate's transfer from minimum to medium security facility was lawful,
advancing legitimate penological goals.  55 F.3d 454.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where appellants claimed, inter alia, that restrictions
imposed on organizations who chose to receive Legal Services Corporation funds
were unconstitutional because they conditioned the receipt of a benefit, the
grant of federal funds, on the relinquishment of the right to engage in
protected activities, appellants' unconstitutional conditions argument was
without merit because neither the congressional enactments nor the implementing
regulations infringed on First Amendment rights.  145 F.3d 1017.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Independent candidates for president denied access to State's
ballot for the 2004 election appealed district court's holding that relevant
provisions governing access do not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments
or the equal protection clause; district court's holding that the presidential
ballot access scheme is constitutional,  affirmed.  620 F.3d 1214.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Government cannot require an individual to relinquish First
Amendment rights as a condition of employment.  437 F. Supp. 368.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Joint efforts to influence officials in the exercise of their
public duties are beyond scope of antitrust laws in that to prohibit such
activity would impair right to petition government.  460 F. Supp. 1359.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  County ordinance which allows refusal to issue, suspension,
or revocation of license to exhibit public shows on grounds of (1) presentation
of obscene, indecent, or immoral show; or (2) past violation of certain
pornography statutes is unconstitutional on its face.  488 F. Supp. 820.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Service of process is an expressive act protected by the
First Amendment.  823 F. Supp. 806.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  With the ability to control the separately incorporated and
insular second organization, alternative channels existed for Legal Services
Corporation-funded organizations to pursue their constitutionally protected
activities; thus, the Legal Services Corporation regulations did not constitute
an unconstitutional condition and thus, were not violative of plaintiffs' First
Amendment rights.  981 F. Supp. 1288.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State's motion for a preliminary injunction granted, where
State sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendants from taking any
further steps to implement termination agreement and close newspaper, and
defendants claimed, among other things, that any injunctive relief would
necessarily violate their First Amendment rights to refrain from speaking or
publishing.  99 F. Supp. 2d 1241.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment granted as to
plaintiff's claim that defendants misappropriated and used plaintiff's name and
likeness in an unfavorable publication without plaintiff's authorization; the
published article, photographs, and liner notes were newsworthy and relevant.  528
F. Supp. 2d 1081.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Ordinance prohibiting use of streets for soliciting sales
does not abridge freedom of press or freedom of speech.  43 H. 71.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Loitering&quot; statutes, effect of First Amendment, §265-52
distinguished.  49 H. 624, 632, 425 P.2d 1014.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Narrowing of statute by common sense interpretation where no
First Amendment rights involved.  49 H. 624, 634, 425 P.2d 1014.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Obstructing use of university office constituted conduct
outside First Amendment rights, and ex parte temporary restraining order was
not constitutionally invalid.  52 H. 427, 478 P.2d 320.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Exercise of First Amendment rights and the trespass
statutes.  54 H. 450, 509 P.2d 1095.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Obscenity is outside protection of First Amendment.  58 H.
440, 573 P.2d 945.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by disqualification of recalled officials from
running for vacancy created by recall.  68 H. 263, 711 P.2d 723.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 842-2(3) does not implicate First Amendment concerns
because it is neither directed at, nor does it regulate or proscribe First
Amendment freedoms, i.e., membership in a political organization or certain
beliefs held by an individual.  84 H. 211, 933 P.2d 48.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 712-1200 does not proscribe constitutionally
protected conduct and was not overbroad as applied to defendant's actual
conduct; the language of the section also was sufficiently clear that defendant
was not required to guess at its meaning, the statute gave defendant fair
warning that defendant was prohibited from offering or agreeing to engage in
sex for a fee.  107 H. 360 (App.), 113 P.3d 811.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Given the apparent absence of a &quot;countervailing state
interest of overriding significance&quot;, family court's restrictions violated
mother's right to free access to the courts where family court required mother,
if she was represented by an attorney, to access the record in the case only
through a licensed Hawaii attorney or other attorney admitted pro hac vice, or
allowing mother, if she was representing herself pro se, to access the record
only if she was accompanied by a family court staff person.  118 H. 293 (App.),
188 P.3d 807.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Establishment of religion.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Statute declaring Good Friday as state holiday does not
violate establishment clause.  932 F.2d 765.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  University policy of not funding student organizational
activities intended to or actually promoting particular religious points of
view, even if secular in context, constitutional if funding criteria evenly
applied to all eligible groups seeking funding of nonsectarian events.  15 F.3d
922.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Parole officer did not have qualified immunity.  First
Amendment was violated where the parole officer allegedly required a parolee to
attend a drug treatment program rooted in religious faith and then recommended
revoking parole because the parolee refused to participate; pertinent
establishment clause law was clearly established on this point such that a
reasonable official would know that the official's conduct was illegal.  504
F.3d 705.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000
does not violate the establishment clause in a land use context.  298 F. Supp.
2d 1010.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction denied as to
their establishment clause claim, where they claimed, inter alia, that certain
staff members at a secure juvenile correctional facility promoted religion,
often discussing religious teachings and quoting from the Bible, and that the
facility ratified the conduct of these staff members.  415 F. Supp. 2d 1129.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Freedom of press.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Reporter's right of access to government news conferences. 
369 F. Supp. 906.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Factors used to determine whether news reporter must reveal
sources in libel action.  507 F. Supp. 880.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Freedom of press guarantee is not sufficient in itself to
protect reporter from being compelled to disclose confidential news source.  45
H. 317, 367 P.2d 472.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Is not an absolute.  45 H. 317, 367 P.2d 472.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In libel action by county supervisor against newspaper,
plaintiff at trial must show knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of the
truth, but upon defendant's motion for summary judgment situation different. 
49 H. 675, 427 P.2d 79.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In libel action, newspaper publisher not entitled to have
case withdrawn from the jury merely because the article is not clearly
defamatory.  49 H. 675, 681-83, 427 P.2d 79.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Libel action by public official against newspaper; summary
judgment for defendant granted when.  50 H. 648, 448 P.2d 337.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defamation; concept of &quot;public figure&quot; discussed. 
56 H. 522, 543 P.2d 1356.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  News media liable for negligent defamation of private person. 
56 H. 522, 543 P.2d 1356.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right to freedom of press not denied by the closing of
judicial proceedings to the public.  59 H. 224, 580 P.2d 49.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff in defamation action failed to prove that
newspaper had acted with actual malice when it erroneously published story
naming plaintiff as the target of an investigation, summary judgment for
newspaper properly granted.  89 H. 254, 971 P.2d 1089.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Freedom of religion.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Compelling government interest in preventing trespass to
military land outweighs defendant's free exercise of religion.  582 F.2d 1194.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sex education films, shown to fifth and sixth grades, with
excusal system which permitted parents to have their children excused from
viewing the films did not violate the free exercise of religion clause.  52 H.
436, 478 P.2d 314.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by requiring church-run school to make
unemployment contributions on behalf of its lay teachers and staff.  68 H. 410,
718 P.2d 267.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Geothermal plant does not regulate or burden religious
beliefs nor does it inhibit religious speech.  69 H. 255, 740 P.2d 28.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the First Amendment and article I, §4 of Hawai‘i
constitution, civil courts have no authority to resolve disputes that turn on
matters of church doctrine, practice, polity, or administration or that cannot
be decided without resolving underlying controversies over such matters.  When
faced with such claims, civil courts must dismiss them.  77 H. 383, 885 P.2d
361.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Not violated by director's failure to grant building height
restriction zoning variance for temple hall where plaintiff Buddhist temple
failed to demonstrate substantial burden on its free exercise of religion
because of height restriction.  87 H. 217, 953 P.2d 1315.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court did not err in concluding that defendant failed
to prove that §712-1249.5 unconstitutionally burdened the free exercise of
defendant's religion where defendant failed to establish that the trial court
clearly erred in finding that defendant did not demonstrate that defendant's
religion required possession or cultivation of fifty or more marijuana plants. 
108 H. 169, 118 P.3d 652.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the circumstances of the case, the free exercise clause
of the First Amendment was not a viable defense to prosecution under §712-1249;
§712-1249 is a neutral law of general applicability to the extent it purports
to prohibit, without exception, the possession of marijuana and any other
substance defined as a &quot;Schedule V substance&quot; by chapter 329, it does
not interfere with other constitutional rights, and it does not create a
mechanism for governmental assessment of individual applicants for exemptions. 
115 H. 396, 168 P.3d 526.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Statute prohibiting possession of marijuana did not burden
defendant's free exercise of religion.  5 H. App. 411, 695 P.2d 336.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where church was not a hierarchical church, but a
congregational church that made decisions by a vote of its members as set forth
in its &quot;petition for charter&quot; of incorporation and by-laws, the
church was governed by chapter 414D; thus, appellants should have been allowed
to amend their complaint, had standing to contest their expulsion, and were not
precluded from doing so by the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine; also,
doctrine did not bar appellants' complaint to the extent it did not require
resolution of controversies over church doctrine, law, or polity.  118 H. 165
(App.), 185 P.3d 913.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Freedom of speech.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Does not prevent defendant's exclusion from military base
after being barred.  472 U.S. 675.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 291C-77(c), banning political signs on public
sidewalk, denies freedom of speech.  516 F.2d 892.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 11-216(d) unconstitutional to the extent that it
prevents an individual from disclosing that the individual filed a complaint
with campaign spending commission.  30 F.3d 1115.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' statements implying attorney's poor client
representation not defamatory where general and specific contexts in which
statements were made did not imply assertion of an objective fact and
statements were incapable of being proved true or false.  56 F.3d 1147.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' sales of T-shirts imprinted with philosophical
and inspirational messages fell within ambit of First Amendment; peddling
ordinance prohibiting sale of merchandise on city streets was content-neutral,
narrowly tailored to serve substantial interests throughout Waikiki, and left
ample alternative channels of communication.  76 F.3d 1009.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' free speech claim rejected, where plaintiffs
argued that  Hawaii's policy of putting all questions on the same physical
ballot, when combined with Hawai‘i State AFL-CIO v. Yoshina's method for
calculating a majority, &quot;coerced&quot; votes in violation of First
Amendment. 140 F.3d 1218.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  District court judgment in favor of plaintiff affirmed, where
defendants, state officials, contended, among other things, that there was
insufficient evidence to support court's findings of retaliatory motives on the
part of defendants.  283 F.3d 1070.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Mt. Healthy mixed-motive analysis applies to First Amendment
claims, regardless of whether the plaintiff uses direct or circumstantial
evidence to prove there was a retaliatory motive behind the adverse employment
action.  283 F.3d 1070.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Ordinance requiring all publishers who wished to distribute
their publications along sidewalks in the Waikiki special district to use one
of two sets of newsracks, one reserved solely for publications that charge
readers and one just for free publications, did not violate the First
Amendment.  298 F.3d 1037.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Ordinance prohibiting aerial advertising did not violate the
First Amendment or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
Honolulu's airspace was a nonpublic forum, and the ordinance was reasonable,
viewpoint neutral, and rationally related to legitimate governmental
interests.  455 F.3d 910.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Violated by city ordinance purporting to prohibit outdoor
political signs on private and public property.  762 F. Supp. 280.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Rule 3.5(b) of Hawaii rules of professional conduct
unconstitutional, where, inter alia, language of rule 3.5(b) prohibiting ex
parte communication with jurors &quot;except as permitted by law&quot; was
unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  916 F. Supp. 1525.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Statements in editorial about plaintiff (when plaintiff was
mayor) were protected by First Amendment and thus, not actionable.  930 F.
Supp. 1403.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs filed motion for preliminary injunction
regarding Act 359 of 1993 Hawaii legislature (relating to Hawaiian
sovereignty), as amended in 1994 and 1996, plaintiffs unlikely to prevail on
First Amendment claims as to native Hawaiian vote.  941 F. Supp. 1529.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff (who previously held a position at correctional
facility), was not entitled to First Amendment protection, where plaintiff's
repeated grievances and complaints regarding plaintiff's lack of safety at
correctional facility, i.e., plaintiff's requests for a personal security
guard, did not substantially involve matters of public concern.  25 F. Supp. 2d
1124.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff-physician claimed that plaintiff had been
illegally harassed and retaliated against by the defendants who acted as part of
an illegal conspiracy against plaintiff and that all of the defendants' actions
constituted retaliation against plaintiff for exercising plaintiff's First
Amendment right to speak out about inmate abuse at correctional facility,
defendants, among other things, engaged in a conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of
constitutionally protected rights to free speech in violation of 42 U.S.C.
§1983.  99 F. Supp. 2d 1216.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendants argued that plaintiff waived constitutional
right to free speech by voluntarily signing Code of Fair Campaign Practices
(Code), plaintiff did not waive ability to assert First Amendment rights;
campaign spending commission's (commission) administrative decision did not
have preclusive effect on the court proceeding; Code unconstitutionally
burdened protected speech; commission's censure of plaintiff violated plaintiff's
First Amendment rights to free speech.  135 F. Supp. 2d 1114.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In lawsuit involving a challenge to city and county of
Honolulu's practice of charging nonresidents a $3 fee to enter bay designated a
marine life conservation district and nature preserve, plaintiff's First
Amendment rights not violated and ordinance instituting the fee not overbroad. 
215 F. Supp. 2d 1098.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff maintained that defendant union provided inadequate
information to nonmembers prior to making union payroll deductions pursuant to
§89-4, in violation of Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson.  Defendants were
preliminarily enjoined from taking any action to demand and/or collect from
plaintiff and class members, by any means, agency fees and from taking any
other action to enforce §89-4(a), until a mechanism for withdrawing agency fees
that was in compliance with Hudson was devised and approved, where plaintiff
alleged, among other things, irreparable injury by arguing that any violation
of Hudson notice requirements infringed upon plaintiff's First Amendment
rights.  269 F. Supp. 2d 1252.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs asserted that an ordinance preventing them from
flying their aerial tow banners over the city's beaches violated their rights
under the First Amendment; the ordinance was a reasonable, viewpoint neutral
restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum.  345 F. Supp. 2d 1123.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment denied,
where, inter alia, taking plaintiff's allegations as true, the complaint set
forth sufficient facts to support plaintiff's claim that defendants' actions
infringed upon plaintiff's First Amendment rights, either because defendants'
actions caused plaintiff actual harm or because those actions chilled future
speech, and defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.  400 F. Supp.
2d 1223.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 446E-5(f) is not an unconstitutional restriction on
free speech.  486 F. Supp. 2d 1132.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendants' motions for summary judgment granted in part as
to plaintiffs' First Amendment retaliation claims brought under 42 U.S.C.
§1983; plaintiffs failed to provide evidence on which a reasonable jury could
find a municipal policy or custom sufficient to create liability under §1983. 
621 F. Supp. 2d 1019.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim dismissed in
its entirety, where plaintiff's statements were made pursuant to plaintiff's
official duties or were not substantial or motivating factors in the adverse
employment action.  679 F. Supp. 2d 1188.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs challenged department of land and natural
resources administrative regulations that required a permit for commercial
activity (including weddings performed or arranged for a fee) on public
beaches:  (1) plaintiffs had standing to make an as-applied challenge; (2)
since state unencumbered beaches are non-public fora for purposes of a First
Amendment analysis, regulation need only satisfy a requirement of
reasonableness, and the regulations passed the test; assuming beaches were
public fora, the regulations passed a stricter test for constitutionality; and
(3) even if the court had jurisdiction over the breach of settlement agreement
(in prior action) claim, plaintiffs would not prevail on that claim.  685 F.
Supp. 2d 1140.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff could not maintain the present action where
plaintiff had agreed to &quot;forever release, acquit, and discharge&quot; the
claims in the mutual release and settlement agreement in plaintiff's first
action.  686 F. Supp. 2d 1079.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Right to receive information and ideas not infringed by
statutes proscribing possession of marijuana.  56 H. 501, 542 P.2d 366.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Standard for suppression of evidence where seizure violated
freedom of speech or expression.  63 H. 596, 634 P.2d 80.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Ordinance prohibiting distribution of commercial handbills in
Waikiki impermissibly regulated commercial speech.  64 H. 148, 637 P.2d 1117.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Peddling ordinance unduly restricted commercial speech.  64
H. 499, 643 P.2d 1058.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Attorneys' extrajudicial statements may be subject to prior
restraint by trial court upon demonstration that the activity restrained poses
a serious and imminent threat to defendant's right to a fair trial and to the
fair administration of justice.  73 H. 499, 835 P.2d 637.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 707-716 not unconstitutional where threats
sufficiently unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey a
gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution.  75 H. 398, 862 P.2d
1063.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff was removed from project, State did not
violate the Hawai‘i Whistleblowers' Protection Act or the First Amendment when
it reassigned the project to someone else.  76 H. 332, 876 P.2d 1300.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's statement not false or defamatory where statement
was rhetorical hyperbole--figurative or hyperbolic language that would negate
the impression that defendant was asserting an objective fact about plaintiff. 
88 H. 94, 962 P.2d 353.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Neither the free speech clause of the U.S. Constitution nor
that of the Hawaii constitution impose a temporal &quot;immediacy&quot; requirement
that must be met before words become subject to criminal prosecution as &quot;true
threats&quot; under §§707-715 and 707-716.  95 H. 465, 24 P.3d 661.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where student manager was a public agent of the university
and manager did not identify any matter of public concern addressed by manager's
racial slur directed at complainant or accompanying threatening statements,
manager's speech was not protected speech.  102 H. 307, 76 P.3d 550.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A &quot;misrepresentation&quot; made under the mantle of &quot;self-advocacy&quot;
at a department hearing is not constitutionally protected by this Amendment. 
113 H. 1, 147 P.3d 785.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where there was no evidence that the &quot;interior work area&quot;
of the state department of transportation building where the union bulletin
board was located had been transformed from a &quot;non-public forum&quot; into
a public forum, bulletin board remained a non-public forum; thus, where the
State's bulletin board posting prohibition was against all campaign materials,
and not simply against materials advocating a particular viewpoint, the
prohibition against campaign materials on the union bulletin board was not in
violation of this Amendment.  116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 852-1 not unconstitutional as it does not prohibit
picketing or the communication of messages altogether, is specifically aimed at
conduct causing an obstruction of ingress to or egress from public or private
places, and individuals may continue to exercise rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment and article I, §4 of the Hawaii constitution as long as they do not
do so in a manner prohibited by section.  89 H. 27 (App.), 968 P.2d 194.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's continuing physical obstruction of the lawful
work by the Hawaii county department of water supply on Hawaiian home lands
property constituted conduct clearly outside the scope of any First Amendment
right to freedom of speech.  105 H. 319 (App.), 97 P.3d 395.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As the First Amendment does not protect speech which is part
of a course of criminal conduct, and defendant's words were an integral part of
defendant's conduct in violating a valid statute prohibiting offers or
agreements to engage in sex for a fee (§712-1200), defendant's prosecution did
not violate this Amendment.  107 H. 360 (App.), 113 P.3d 811.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Right of privacy.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff failed to show sufficient likelihood that
state child protective services agency would violate plaintiff's privacy rights
in the future, plaintiff lacked standing to seek injunctive relief against
agency.  68 F.3d 331.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sex education film series shown to fifth and sixth grades
with excusal system which permitted parents to have their children excused from
viewing films did not contravene parents' right of privacy.  52 H. 436, 478
P.2d 314.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where police forcibly entered petitioner's home in pursuit of
petitioner's son without a warrant and in the absence of any exigent
circumstances, there was no conceivable basis in the law to uphold the entry as
valid; thus, trial court's conclusion to the contrary reversed.  121 H. 74, 214
P.3d 613.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Search and seizure generally.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Container search by government agents that occurred at the
U.S. border as the container was entering the country, was conducted in a
reasonable manner and the searches of defendant at the airport as defendant was
exiting the country, were constitutionally valid.  610 F. Supp. 2d 1234.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where police consent form stated that search of defendant's
automobile and its contents was expressly confined to evidence of
&quot;firearms, ammunition&quot;, and officer acknowledged that the wallet was
lying closed on the seat and that officer searched the wallet for ammunition
but that officer was not nervous because officer could not &quot;feel
anything&quot;, officer 's observations did not reasonably suggest the presence
of ammunition in the wallet; thus, the continued search of the wallet that uncovered
another person's license was objectively unreasonable and exceeded the scope of
defendant's consent.  121 H. 533 (App.), 221 P.3d 511.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Navy police officer's initial search of defendant's car after
defendant drove defendant's car back through the base gate and subsequent
search by federal agents were supported by probable cause given the collective
knowledge of the officers who were involved in the investigation and
apprehension of defendant and thus were valid under the federal automobile
exception to the warrant requirement; given the proximity in time and location
to the reported theft involving defendant, the large amount of money involved
and other circumstances, there was probable cause to believe that the missing
money or other evidence would be present in defendant's car.  122 H. 2 (App.),
222 P.3d 409.</p>
