certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shall report
information about health care-associated infections to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's national healthcare safety network, as specified in
the rules of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b) &nbsp;Health care facilities subject to
this section shall authorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
allow the department to access health care-associated infection data reported
by those health care facilities to the national healthcare safety network.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The department may adopt rules pursuant to
chapter 91 to require that health care-associated infections that are
multidrug-resistant be reported to the department through the national
healthcare safety network.&nbsp; The rules shall specify which health care
facilities are required to report those health care-associated infections that
are multidrug-resistant through the national healthcare safety network, as well
as the patient populations that are to be targeted in the reports.&nbsp; The
first year of reporting required under this subsection shall be a pilot test of
the reporting system and shall not be reported or disclosed to the public.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d) &nbsp;The department shall preserve patient
confidentiality and shall not disclose to the public any patient-level data
obtained from any health care facility.</p>

the public regarding health care-associated infections in aggregate data form
to protect individual patient identity.&nbsp; The reports may identify
individual health care facilities.&nbsp; The reports shall use the methodology

Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for national
reporting of health care-associated infections.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f) &nbsp;Health care-associated infection
information held by the department as a result of reporting under this section
is not subject to subpoena, discovery, or introduction into evidence in any
civil or criminal proceeding; provided that health care-associated infection
information otherwise available from other sources is not immune from subpoena,
discovery, or introduction into evidence through those sources solely because
the information was reported as required by this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Beginning on June 30, 2013, and no later
than June 30 of each year, thereafter, the department shall prepare a public
report, in accordance with this section, containing information pertaining to
health care-associated infections in the State for the previous calendar year.</p>
