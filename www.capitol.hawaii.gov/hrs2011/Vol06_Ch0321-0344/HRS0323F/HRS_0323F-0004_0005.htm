board shall be appointed by the governor as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Three members from a list of five persons
submitted by the president of the senate; provided that at least one of these
members shall have experience in the insurance industry and financial matters;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Three members from a list of five persons
submitted by the speaker of the house of representatives; provided that at

serve as ex officio, nonvoting members.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Any vacancy shall be filled in the same manner
provided for the original appointments.  The captive insurance board shall
elect its own chair from among its members.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The selection, appointment, and
confirmation of any appointed nominee shall be based on ensuring that captive
insurance board members have diverse and beneficial perspectives and
experiences and that they include, to the extent possible, representatives of
the insurance and/or finance sectors.  Members of the captive insurance board
shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for actual expenses,
including travel expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Any appointed member of the captive

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Any other cause that may render a member incapable
or unfit to discharge the duties required under this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>Filing nomination papers for elective office,
appointment to elective office, or conviction of a felony consistent with
section 831-3.1, shall automatically and immediately disqualify a board member
from office.</p>

parent, grandparent, or any related individual who resides in the same
household of the employee or vendor. [L 2007, c 278, §2]</p>
