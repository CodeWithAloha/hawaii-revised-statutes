<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§482P-</b><b>8  Procedure for identifying
transferees, licensees, or assignees; requirement to seek damages or relief.  </b>(a) 
An assignee or transferee of publicity rights shall have the right to make a
publicity rights name registration.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Publicity rights of a deceased person that
were not previously assigned or transferred shall be part of the deceased
person's estate and shall be administered by the personal representative of the
deceased person as personal property of the deceased person.  On or before closing
of probate of a deceased person's estate, the publicity rights of the deceased
person shall vest in the transferees of the personal property of the estate in
conformity with the deceased person's will or probate order.  If publicity
rights are not expressly addressed by the terms of the will or a probate order,
and if a publicity rights name registration is not in effect at the time of the
relevant assignment or license, after probate closes, any one of the
transferees of the personal property of the deceased person's estate shall have
the right to assign or license the publicity rights of the deceased person, and
a valid license from any of the transferees of the personal property of the
deceased person's estate shall constitute a complete defense to any
infringement action under this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Any person seeking to license publicity
rights from a living person shall have the right to presume that a living
individual or personality has the right to assign or license the individual's
or personality's publicity rights unless there is a publicity rights name
registration for that individual or personality.  If there is a publicity
rights name registration for that individual or personality, the person seeking
to license publicity rights shall inform the living person in writing that an
assignment or license shall be sought from the holder of the publicity rights
name registration before entering into the assignment or license.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If there is a publicity rights name
registration for a given individual or personality, any person seeking to
license publicity rights for that individual or personality shall have the
right to presume that the holder of the publicity rights name registration has
the right to assign or license the individual's or personality's publicity
rights and a valid license from the registered holder of the publicity rights
name registration shall constitute a complete defense to any infringement
action under this section; provided that the assignee or transferee has kept
the publicity rights name registration active and in force and maintained the
accuracy of the information in the publicity rights name registration filing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A person commits an offense if the person
signs, manually or via electronic means, a document the person knows is false
in any material respect with the intent that the document be delivered or
transmitted to the director in connection with a publicity rights name
registration under this section.  An offense under this subsection shall be a
class C felony and may carry a fine not to exceed $10,000.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  A person commits a misdemeanor if the
person negligently and without intent to defraud signs, manually or via
electronic means, a document that is false in any material respect with intent
that the document be delivered or transmitted to the director in connection
with a publicity rights name registration under this section.  Commission of a
misdemeanor under this subsection may carry a fine not to exceed $2,000.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <span style='color:black'>(g)  </span><span
style='color:black'>Any person who knowingly makes a false or fraudulent
representation or declaration </span>in connection with a publicity rights name<span
style='color:black'> registration pursuant to this section shall be liable for
all damages sustained as a result of the false or fraudulent publicity rights
name registration as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.</span> [L
