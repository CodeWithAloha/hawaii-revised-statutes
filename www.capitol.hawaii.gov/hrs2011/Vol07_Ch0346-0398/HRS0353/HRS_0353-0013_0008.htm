least one of the person's closest adult relatives if any can be found.  Notice
of the hearing shall also be served on the public defender, person's attorney,
or other court-appointed attorney, as the case may be.  If the person is a
minor, notice of the hearing shall also be served upon the person who has had
the principal care and custody of the minor during the sixty days preceding the
date of the petition if the person can be found within the State.  Notice shall
also be given to the other persons as the court may designate.</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Written notice, in plain and simple language,

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Notice that the person is entitled to the
assistance of an attorney and that the public defender has been notified of
these proceedings;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Notice that if the person does not want to be
represented by the public defender, the person may contact the person's own
attorney; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Notice, if applicable, that the petitioner
intends to present evidence to show that the person is an incapacitated or
protected person, or both, under article V of chapter 560, and whether the

guardian is to be recommended, and a nominee is known at the time the petition

order the person to be given the care or treatment as the court deems to be
proper under the circumstance. [L 2011, c 72, pt of §2]</span></p>
