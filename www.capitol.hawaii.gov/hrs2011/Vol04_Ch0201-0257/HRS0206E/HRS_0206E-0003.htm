<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §206E-3  Hawaii community development
authority; established.</b>  (a)  There is established the Hawaii community
development authority, which shall be a body corporate and a public
instrumentality of the State, for the purpose of implementing this chapter.  The
authority shall be placed within the department of business, economic
development, and tourism for administrative purposes.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (b)  The
authority shall consist of thirteen voting members.  The director of finance,
the director of business, economic development, and tourism, the comptroller,
and the director of transportation, or their respective designated
representatives shall serve as ex officio, voting members.  One member shall be
appointed by the governor from a list of not less than three prospective
appointees submitted by the president of the senate, and one member shall be
appointed by the governor from a list of not less than three prospective
appointees submitted by the speaker of the house of representatives.  Seven
members shall be appointed by the governor for staggered terms pursuant to
section 26-34; provided that four members shall be appointed at large and,
initially, three members, hereinafter referred to as county members, shall be
selected from a list of ten prospective appointees recommended by the local
governing body of the county in which the initial designated district is
situated; and provided further that when vacancies occur in any of the three
positions for which the members were selected from a list of county
recommendations, the governor shall fill such vacancies on the basis of one
from a list of four recommendations, two from a list of seven recommendations,
or three from a list of ten recommendations.  The list of recommendations shall
be made by the local governing body of the county.  </span><span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Of the nine members appointed either by the
governor from the lists provided by the president of the senate and speaker of
the house, at-large by the governor, or as county members recommended by the
local governing body of the county in which the initial designated district is
situated, at least two members shall represent small businesses and shall be
designated as the small business representatives on the board whose purpose,
among other things, is to vote on matters before the board that affect small
businesses.  The small business representatives shall be owners or active
managers of a small business with its principal place of operation located
within the physical boundaries of the initial designated district. 
Notwithstanding section 84-14(a), the small business representatives shall not
be prohibited from voting on any matter concerning any district under the
board's jurisdiction; provided that the matter is not limited to solely
benefiting the specific interest of that member and the matter concerns broader
interests within the district.  </span><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>If
an additional district is designated by the legislature, the total membership
of the authority shall be increased as prescribed above by the appointment of
three additional members, except as provided for in section 206E-191. 
Notwithstanding section 92-15, a majority of all members shall constitute a
quorum to do business, and the concurrence of a majority of all members shall
be necessary to make any action of the authority valid; except that, on any
matter relating solely to a specific community development district, the
members representing districts other than that specific community development
district shall neither vote, nor shall they be counted to constitute a quorum,
and concurrence shall be required of a majority of that portion of the
authority made up of all ex officio voting members, members at large, and
county and district members representing the district for which action is being
proposed for such action to be valid.  All members shall continue in office
until their respective successors have been appointed and qualified.  Except as
herein provided, no member appointed under this subsection shall be an officer
or employee of the State or its political subdivisions.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     For [purposes]
of this section, &quot;small business&quot; means a business which is
independently owned and which is not dominant in its field of operation.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The authority shall appoint the executive
director who shall be the chief executive officer.  The authority shall set the
salary of the executive director, who shall serve at the pleasure of the
authority and shall be exempt from chapter 76.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The authority shall annually elect the
chairperson and vice chairperson from among its members.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The members of the authority appointed
