<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§124A-97]  Review of records; disposition.</b> 
(a)  If the convening authority is the governor, the convening authority's
action on the review of any record of trial is final, subject only to an appeal
for judicial review pursuant to section 124A-105.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  In all other cases not covered by
subsection (a), if the sentence of a special court-martial as approved by the
convening authority includes a bad-conduct discharge, whether or not suspended,
the entire record shall be sent to the appropriate staff judge advocate or
legal officer of the state force concerned to be reviewed in the same manner as
a record of trial by general court-martial.  The record and the opinion of the
staff judge advocate or legal officer shall then be sent to the state judge
advocate for review.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  All other special and summary
court-martial records shall be sent to the law specialist or legal officer of
the appropriate force of the state military forces and shall be acted upon,
transmitted, and disposed of as may be prescribed by rules adopted by the
governor; provided that any final disposition of any special court-martial
under this subsection is subject to appeal for judicial review pursuant to
section 124A-105.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The state judge advocate shall review the
record of trial in each case sent to the state judge advocate for review as
provided under subsection (b).  If the final action of the court-martial has
resulted in an acquittal of all charges and specifications, the opinion of the
state judge advocate is limited to questions of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The state judge advocate shall take final
action in any case reviewable by the state judge advocate, subject only to an
appeal for judicial review pursuant to section 124A-105.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  In a case reviewable by the state judge
advocate under this section, the state judge advocate may act only with respect
to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority.  The state
judge advocate may affirm only such findings of guilty, and the sentence or
such part or amount of the sentence, as the state judge advocate finds correct
in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be
approved.  In considering the record, the state judge advocate may weigh the
evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted
questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the
witnesses.  If the state judge advocate sets aside the findings and sentence,
the state judge advocate may, except where the setting aside is based on lack
of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a
rehearing.  If the state judge advocate sets aside the findings and sentence
and does not order a rehearing, the state judge advocate shall order that the
charges be dismissed.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  In a case reviewable by the state judge
advocate under this section, the state judge advocate shall instruct the
convening authority to act in accordance with the state judge advocate's
decision on the review.  If the state judge advocate has ordered a rehearing
but the convening authority finds a rehearing impracticable, the state judge
advocate may dismiss the charges.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The state judge advocate may order one or
more boards of review each composed of not less than three commissioned
officers of the state military forces, each of whom must be a member of the bar
of the highest court of the State.  Each board of review shall review the
record of any trial by special court-martial, including a sentence to a
bad-conduct discharge, referred to it by the state judge advocate.  Boards of
review have the same authority on review as the state judge advocate has under
this section. [L 1982, c 171, pt of §2; gen ch 1985]</p>
