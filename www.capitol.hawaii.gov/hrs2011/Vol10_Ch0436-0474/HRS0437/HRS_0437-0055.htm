<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     [§437-55]  Establishment or relocation of
franchise within relevant market area.</b>  (a)  When a manufacturer or
distributor establishes or relocates a franchise within the relevant market
area of an existing dealer with a franchise for the same line make, the
manufacturer or distributor shall provide a notice to such existing dealers,
hereinafter &quot;affected dealers&quot;.  For the purposes of this section,
&quot;affected dealer&quot; means a dealer that operates a same line make
franchise in a relevant market area wherein the manufacturer or distributor is
proposing to add or relocate a franchise.  The manufacturer's or distributor's
notice shall state the location of the proposed dealership and the date on or
after which the franchise intends to be engaged in business.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  An affected dealer may file a petition in
the manner prescribed in section 437-51 within thirty days of receipt of the
manufacturer's or distributor's notice for determination of whether the
manufacturer or distributor has good cause to establish or relocate an
additional franchise within the dealer's relevant market area.  When such a
petition is filed, the manufacturer or distributor shall not establish or
relocate the proposed franchise until a hearing has been held and a
determination made whether good cause exists for the proposed addition or
relocation.  The determination of a petition filed under this subsection shall
be made no later than one hundred eighty days from receipt of notice of the
petition except for good cause.  The manufacturer or distributor shall have the
burden of proof to demonstrate good cause exists for the addition or relocation
of an additional franchise within the affected dealer's relevant market area.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  In determining whether the manufacturer or
distributor has good cause to add or relocate the franchise into an affected
dealer's relevant market area the hearings officer under section 437-51 shall
consider and make findings upon evidence including the permanency and size of
investment made and the reasonable obligations incurred by the existing new
motor vehicle dealers in the relevant market area; the growth or decline in
population and new car registrations in the relevant market area; the effect on
the consuming public in the relevant market area; whether it is injurious or
beneficial to the public welfare for a new dealer to be established; whether
the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line make in that area are providing
adequate competition and convenient customer care for the motor vehicles of the
same line make including the adequacy of motor vehicle sales and service
facilities, equipment, supply of motor vehicle parts, and qualified service
personnel; whether the establishment or relocation of the proposed dealership
appears to be warranted and justified based on economic and marketing
conditions pertinent to dealers competing in the community or territory,
including anticipating future changes; the effect on the relocating dealer of a
denial of its relocation into the relevant market area; and the reasonably expected
market penetration of the line make motor vehicle for the community or
territory involved, after consideration of all factors which may affect such
penetration, including demographic factors such as age, income, education, size
class preference, product popularity, retail lease transactions, or other
factors affecting sales to consumers of the community or territory.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  This section shall not apply to the
relocation of an existing dealer within two miles of the dealer's existing
dealership location; the appointment of a successor dealer at the same location
as its predecessor or within a two-mile radius from any boundary of the
predecessor's former location within one year from the date on which the
predecessor ceased operations or was terminated, whichever occurred later; or
the relocation of a dealer to a site that is farther away from the protesting
affected dealer than the existing location. [L 2010, c 164, pt of §2]</p>
