at least $1,000 or two times the value of the theft, whichever is greater. </p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (5)  A person commits theft of utility services
in the second degree if the person commits theft of utility services other than
as provided in subsection (4).  Theft of utility services in the second degree
is a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced in accordance with chapter 706, except that
for a first offense the court shall impose a minimum sentence of a fine of
$500, with an increase of $500 for each succeeding conviction under this
subsection. [L 1996, c 256, §2]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §708-839.5</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 256, Session Laws 1996, added this section, which
establishes and defines the crime of theft of utility services.  The
legislature recognized that theft of utility services was widespread throughout
the utility industry, that utility companies often spread the loss of revenues
from the thefts to rate payers, and that attempting to steal utility services
can pose a threat of physical injury to innocent persons and the thief.  The
legislature also acknowledged that current theft statutes do not specifically
provide for thefts of utility services.  The legislature found that a new type
of theft needed to be established to deter the theft of utility services.
