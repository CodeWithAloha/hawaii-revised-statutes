section 708&#8209;814(1)(b), and that criminal trespass in the second degree is
a petty misdemeanor;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>        (ii)  The legal name, any aliases, and a

land&quot; under this paragraph notwithstanding minor improvements, including
the installation or maintenance of utility poles, signage, and irrigation
facilities or systems; minor alterations undertaken for the preservation or
prudent management of the unimproved or unused land, including the installation

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to
support claim of the exercise of a constitutionally protected native Hawaiian
right and knowingly entered landowner's property which was fenced in a manner
to exclude others, trial court properly concluded that defendant was unlawfully
on property in violation of subsection (1).  89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where persons were allowed on hotel premises if invited by
hotel guests, State had burden to prove that defendants were not so invited.  2
H. App. 264, 630 P.2d 129.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As criminal liability in section (1993) based only on
contemporaneous refusal to obey warning or request to leave premises, no
conviction where defendant returned to bar more than a month after being given
warning not to return to premises for a year.  80 H. 372 (App.), 910 P.2d 143.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Finding by court that property was &quot;commercial
premises&quot; protected by this section not clearly erroneous.  80 H. 460
(App.), 911 P.2d 95.</p>
