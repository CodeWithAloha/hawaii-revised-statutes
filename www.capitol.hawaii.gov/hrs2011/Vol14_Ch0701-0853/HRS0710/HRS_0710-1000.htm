<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §710-1000</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section is definitional only and, of course, specifies
no offense.  A discussion of the definitions in this section, when needed or
appropriate, is found in the commentary to the substantive offenses employing
the terms defined.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs failed to establish that defendant received
pecuniary benefit from five million dollar gift to city and county of Honolulu.  906 F. Supp. 1377.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Custody&quot; construed.  59 H. 456, 583 P.2d 337.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree
does not require a nexus between the alleged threat and the threatened person's
status as a public servant where the threatened person is a government officer
or employee; thus, trial court did not err in failing to give a nexus
instruction.  111 H. 327, 141 P.3d 974.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under paragraph (15), any &quot;officer or employee of any
branch of government&quot; qualifies as a public servant.  105 H. 261 (App.),
96 P.3d 590.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under paragraph (15), a person qualifies as a public servant
based on the type of work he or she performs, and not based on when that work
is being performed.  105 H. 261 (App.), 96 P.3d 590.</p>
