directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Claimant&quot; means any insured making a

person who is an affiliate of the insolvent insurer may be a claimant.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Control&quot; means the possession,
direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract other than a commercial contract for goods or
nonmanagement services, or otherwise, unless the power is the result of an
official position with or corporate office held by the person.  Control shall
be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls,
holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, ten per cent or
more of the voting securities of any other person.  This presumption may be
rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Covered claim&quot;:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Means an unpaid claim, including one for unearned
premiums, submitted by a claimant, that arises out of and is within the
coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy to
which this part applies issued by an insurer, if the insurer becomes an
insolvent insurer after July 1, 2000, and:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  The claimant or insured is a resident of
this State at the time of the insured event; provided that for entities other
than an individual, the residence of a claimant, insured, or policyholder is
the state in which its principal place of business is located at the time of
the insured event; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  The claim is a first party claim for
damage to property with a permanent location in this State; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Shall not include:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Any amount awarded as punitive or
exemplary damages;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Any amount sought as a return of premium
under any retrospective rating plan; </p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Any amount due any reinsurer, insurer,
insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries,
reinsurance recoveries, contribution, indemnification, or otherwise;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  Any first party claims by an insured whose
net worth exceeds $25,000,000 on December 31 of the year prior to the year in

worth on that date shall be deemed to include the aggregate net worth of the

is an affiliate of the insolvent insurer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Insolvent insurer&quot; means an insurer
licensed to transact insurance in this State, either at the time the policy was

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Writes any kind of insurance to which this part
applies under section 431:16-103, including the exchange of reciprocal or

<p class=RegularParagraphs>An insurer shall cease to be a member insurer
effective on the day following the termination or expiration of its certificate
of authority to transact the kinds of insurance to which this part applies. 
However, the insurer shall remain liable as a member insurer for any and all
obligations, including obligations for assessments levied either prior to or
after the termination or expiration of its certificate of authority, even
though the insurer became insolvent before the termination or expiration of its
certificate of authority.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Net direct written premiums&quot; means
direct gross premiums written in this State on insurance policies to which this
part applies, less return premiums thereon and dividends paid or credited to

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In light of the legislature's silence on the meaning and
means of valuing &quot;net worth&quot; under this section, &quot;net
worth&quot; may be &quot;book&quot; or &quot;balance sheet&quot; net worth as
governed by generally accepted accounting principles.  123 H. 135 (App.), 231
P.3d 60.</p>
