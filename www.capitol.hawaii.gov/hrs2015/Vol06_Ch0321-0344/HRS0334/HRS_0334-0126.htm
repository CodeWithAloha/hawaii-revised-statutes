<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§334-126  Hearing on petition.</b>  <i>[Repeal
and reenactment on July 1, 2020.  L 2013, c 221, </i><i>§24.]</i>  (a)  The
court may adjourn or continue a hearing for failure to timely notify a person
entitled to be notified.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The time and form of the procedure incident
to hearing the issues in the petition shall be provided by family court rule
and consistent with this part.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Hearings may be held at any convenient
place within the circuit.  The subject of the petition, any interested party,
or the family court upon its own motion may request a hearing in another court
because of inconvenience to the parties, witnesses, or the family court or
because of the subject's physical or mental condition.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The hearing shall be closed to the public,
unless the subject of the petition requests otherwise.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The subject of the petition shall be
present at the hearing.  However, if the subject has been served with the
petition and does not appear at the hearing, the court, in its discretion, may
go forward with the hearing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The subject of the petition need not, but
may, be represented by an attorney.  If the subject desires an attorney and is
indigent, or if the family court determines that the legal or factual issues
raised are of such complexity that the assistance of an attorney is necessary
for an adequate presentation of the merits or that the subject of the petition
is unable to speak for the subject's self, the family court shall order the
appointment of a public defender or other attorney to represent the subject and
continue the hearing for not more than seven days.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  If the subject of the petition is
represented by an attorney, the attorney shall be allowed adequate time for
investigation of the matters at issue and for preparation, and shall be
permitted to present the evidence that the attorney believes necessary for a
proper disposition of the proceeding.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  No subject of the petition shall be
ordered to receive assisted community treatment unless at least one
psychiatrist testifies in person at the hearing who has personally assessed the
subject within the time period commencing ten calendar days before the filing
of the petition and ending at the time of the psychiatrist's testimony.  The
psychiatrist's testimony shall state the facts which support the allegation
that the subject meets all the criteria for assisted community treatment,
provide a written treatment plan, which shall include non-mental health
treatment if appropriate, provide the rationale for the recommended treatment,
and identify the designated mental health program responsible for the
coordination of care.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If the recommended assisted community treatment
includes medication, the psychiatrist's testimony shall describe the types or
classes of medication which should be authorized, and describe the physical and
mental beneficial and detrimental effects of such medication.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     If the subject of the petition has refused to
be examined by a licensed psychiatrist, the family court may request the
subject to consent to examination by a psychiatrist appointed by the court or
employed at a community mental health center.  If the subject of the petition
does not consent and the family court finds sufficient evidence to believe that
the allegations in the petition are true, the family court may order the
commitment of the subject to a psychiatric facility for examination.  The
commitment shall not be for more than forty-eight hours.  The examining
psychiatrist shall submit the findings and recommendations to the family court
in the form of a written treatment plan.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The subject of the petition's refusal to submit
voluntarily to examination shall be treated as a denial that the subject is
mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse, and a denial that the subject
otherwise fits within the criteria for a court order of assisted community
treatment.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Nothing herein shall be construed in a way that
limits the subject of the petition's privilege against self-incrimination.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  The subject of the petition may secure a
psychiatric examination and present the findings as evidence at the hearing. 
The subject shall be entitled to a psychiatric examination at a community
mental health center if the subject so desires, and if an examination has not
already been conducted at a community mental health center which will lead to
psychiatric testimony at the hearing. [L 1984, c 251, pt of §1; am L 2013, c
221, §12]</p>
