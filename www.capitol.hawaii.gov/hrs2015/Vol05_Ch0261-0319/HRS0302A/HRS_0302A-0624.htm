<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§302A-624  Teachers' salary schedule.</b> 
(a)  The salary schedule for all teachers of the department shall be negotiated
pursuant to section 89-9.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  All teachers shall meet the following
requirements:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A teacher shall earn at least five credits within
a three-year cycle to receive increment or longevity step increases in the
third year of the three-year cycle;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A teacher who fails to meet the requirement set
forth in paragraph (1) shall not be eligible for any increment or longevity
step increases until the teacher earns the credit requirement for the
three-year cycle;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any credit earned in excess of any three-year
credit requirement may not be carried over beyond the three-year cycle; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Credits earned may be in the form of in-service, university,
or other credits approved by the department.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A teacher shall be required to spend at
least one year in Class III before going on to Class IV, at least one year in
Class IV before going on to Class V, at least one year in Class V before going
on to Class VI, and at least one year in Class VI before going on to Class VII.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  In case of promotion from a teaching
position to an educational officer, the employee shall receive compensation at
the lowest step of the higher grade that exceeds the employee's existing
compensation by at least eight per cent if such a step exists.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Effective July 1, 2006, the minimum hourly
or minimum per diem rate for substitute teachers shall be determined by the
legislature as follows; provided that any individual in Class I, II, or III who
works less than a full seven-hour work day shall be compensated on a pro-rated,
hourly basis:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Class I:  other individuals who do not possess a
bachelor's degree shall be compensated at a rate of not less than $125 for a
full work day;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Class II:  individuals with a bachelor's degree
shall be compensated at a rate of not less than $136 for a full work day; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Class III:  department of education teachers, or
licensed or highly qualified teachers, shall be compensated at a rate of not
less than $147 for a full work day.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Effective July 1, 2008, the board shall
provide wage adjustments for substitute teachers.  The wage adjustments shall
be comparable to the across-the-board wage adjustments for teachers that are
negotiated for bargaining unit (5) subject to legislative approval, pursuant to
section 89C-5.  The board may also adjust hours, benefits, and other terms and
conditions of employment for substitute teachers. [L 1996, c 89, pt of §2; am L
2005, c 70, §1; am L 2006, c 263, §2; am L 2008, c 187, §2]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As §661-1 contains a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for
claims against the State that are founded upon a statute or founded upon a
contract with the State, the circuit court did not err when it allowed
plaintiff substitute teachers to pursue breach-of-contract claims against the
State where the teachers were in a contractual relationship with the State,
sought money that they claimed were due them for the work they performed under
the contract, and alleged that under the express and implied terms of their
agreement, they were entitled to pay in accordance with subsection (e).  122 H.
150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Notwithstanding subsequent changes to the class II
classification designation, the 1996 legislature's deliberate choice was to tie
a substitute teacher's pay to that of a regular full-time certified teacher
based on an appropriate four years of college and other department of education
(DOE) requirements; thus, subsection (e) continued to govern the pay terms of
the parties' agreement and this section continued to tie the substitute
teachers' pay to that of full-time teachers who possessed an appropriate four
years of college education and other DOE requirements until June 30, 2005.  122
H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The State's sovereign immunity from plaintiff substitute
teachers' claims against the State was waived under §661-1 where subsection (e)
thereof stated that the per diem salary for substitute teachers &quot;shall
be&quot; based on the formula that it described, and subsection (e), as a
pay-mandating statute, provided an alternative basis for invoking the court's
jurisdiction under the &quot;founded upon any statute&quot; language in §661-1. 
122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the issue of mutual assent as to a per diem rate of pay
other than required pursuant to subsection (e) was not material because (1) it
was undisputed that an essential and material part of the parties' agreement
was that the substitute teachers' pay was &quot;subject to applicable state
laws&quot;; and (2) the parties could not contract to violate a law determining
a rate of pay, whether it be more or less than directed by the legislature, the
circuit court properly granted plaintiff teachers summary judgment on issue
that State violated its contractual obligations to pay the per diem rate during
the applicable period. 122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).</p>
