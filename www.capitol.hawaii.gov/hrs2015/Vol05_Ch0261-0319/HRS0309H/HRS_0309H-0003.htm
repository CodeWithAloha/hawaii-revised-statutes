<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     [§309H-3]</b>  <b>Hawaii rural health care
provider loan repayment program. </b> (a)  There is created within the Hawaii
health corps program, the Hawaii rural health care provider loan repayment
program to be administered by the University of Hawaii John A. Burns school of
medicine and the University of Hawaii at Manoa school of nursing and dental
hygiene in partnership with a lending financial institution whose operations
are principally conducted in Hawaii.  The Hawaii rural health care provider
loan repayment program shall provide loan repayments to eligible physicians,
physician assistants, and nurse practitioners who make the service commitment
under subsection (b).  The University of Hawaii John A. Burns school of
medicine and the University of Hawaii at Manoa school of nursing and dental
hygiene shall make loan repayments directly to the financial institution under
subsection (b) to offset the loan repayment for which the Hawaii rural health
care provider loan repayment program recipient would otherwise be liable.  Loan
repayments shall commence upon the commencement of loan repayments by the
Hawaii rural health care provider loan repayment program recipient to the
lending financial institution.  The University of Hawaii John A. Burns school
of medicine and the University of Hawaii at Manoa school of nursing and dental
hygiene shall prioritize loan repayments in accordance with the greatest
specialty shortages for the particular county.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The Hawaii rural health care provider loan
repayment program shall provide loan repayments on behalf of licensed
physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners who agree to serve
for five consecutive years as a physician, physician assistant, or nurse
practitioner in a county having a shortage of physicians, physician assistants,
and nurse practitioners, with priority given to a rural area of that particular
county; provided that eligible physicians, physician assistants, or nurse
practitioners, as applicable, shall have graduated from a duly accredited
medical school or nursing school within the United States; provided further
that preference shall be given to graduates of the University of Hawaii John A.
Burns school of medicine or the University of Hawaii at Manoa school of nursing
and dental hygiene, as applicable.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Eligible participants in the Hawaii rural
health care provider loan program shall be determined by the University of
Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine and the University of Hawaii at Manoa
school of nursing and dental hygiene on a competitive basis and in accordance
with subsection (b).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  If a Hawaii rural health care provider
loan repayment program participant fails to satisfy the recipient's service commitment
under subsection (b), the Hawaii rural health care provider loan repayment program
participant shall be liable for the repayment of the outstanding balance of the
loan to the lending financial institution under subsection (b).  In addition,
the University of Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine and the University of
Hawaii at Manoa school of nursing and dental hygiene may seek reimbursement for
any loan repayment made by the University of Hawaii John A. Burns school of
medicine or the University of Hawaii at Manoa school of nursing and dental
hygiene on behalf of the Hawaii rural health care provider loan repayment program
participant.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In accordance with chapter 103D, the
University of Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine and the University of
Hawaii at Manoa school of nursing and dental hygiene may enter into written contracts
with collection agencies to collect delinquent reimbursements of loan
repayments.  All payments collected, exclusive of a collection agency's
commissions, shall revert and be credited to the Hawaii health corps fund.  A
collection agency that enters into a written contract with the University of
Hawaii John A. Burns school of medicine or the University of Hawaii at Manoa
school of nursing and dental hygiene to collect delinquent reimbursements of
loan repayments pursuant to this section may collect a commission from the
debtor in accordance with the terms of, and up to the amounts authorized in,
the written contract. [L 2012, c 187, pt of §2]</p>
