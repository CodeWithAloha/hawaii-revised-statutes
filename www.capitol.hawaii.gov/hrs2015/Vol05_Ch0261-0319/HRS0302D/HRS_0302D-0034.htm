<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §302D-34  Enrollment.</b>  (a)  A public
charter school shall not discriminate against any student or limit admission
based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, income level, disability, level of proficiency in the English
language, need for special education services, or academic or athletic ability.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  A start-up charter school:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Shall be open to any student residing in the
State who is entitled to attend a department school;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Shall enroll all students who submit an
application, unless the number of students who submit an application exceeds
the capacity of a program, class, grade level, or building;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Shall select students through a public lottery
if, as described in paragraph (2), capacity is insufficient to enroll all
students who have submitted a timely application;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  May give an enrollment preference to students
within a given age group or grade level and may be organized around a special
emphasis, theme, or concept as stated in the charter school's application and
as approved by the charter school's authorizer;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  May give an enrollment preference to students
enrolled in the charter school during the previous school year and to siblings
of students already enrolled at the charter school; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  May give any other enrollment preference
permitted by the charter school's authorizer, on an individual charter school
basis, if consistent with law;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that nothing in this subsection shall
preclude the formation of a start-up charter school whose mission is focused on
serving students with disabilities, who are of the same gender, who pose such
severe disciplinary problems that they warrant a specific educational program,
or who are at a risk of academic failure.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A conversion charter school shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Enroll any student who resides within the
school's former geographic service area pursuant to section 302A-1143, for the
grades that were in place when the department school converted to a charter
school; provided that the department may consult with a conversion charter
school every three years to determine whether realignment of the charter
school's service area is appropriate given population shifts and the
department's overall service area reviews;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Follow the department's procedures regarding
enrollment, including but not limited to geographic exceptions and enrollment
preferences; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Be subject to subsection (b) for grades that were
not in place when the school converted to a public charter school. [L 2013, c
159, pt of §1; am L 2014, c 99, §23]</p>
