<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     <b>[§353-13.9</b></span><b>]</b><b>
<span lang=X-NONE> Hearing on petition.</span></b><b><span lang=X-NONE>  </span></b><span
lang=X-NONE>(a)  The court may adjourn or continue a hearing for failure to
timely notify a spouse, civil union partner, reciprocal beneficiary, guardian,
relative, or other person determined by the court to be entitled to notice, or
for failure by the person who is the subject of the petition to contact an
attorney as provided in section 353-13.8, if the court determines that an
adjournment or continuance is in the interest of justice.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (b)  Unless the hearing is
waived, the judge shall hear the petition as soon as possible and no later than
ten days after the date the petition is filed unless a reasonable delay is
sought for good cause shown by the person who is the subject of the petition,
the person's attorney, or those persons entitled to receive notice of the
hearing under section 353-13.8.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (c)  The person who is the
subject of the petition shall be present at all hearings unless the person
waives the right to be present, is unable to attend, or creates conditions that
make it impossible to conduct the hearing in a reasonable manner as determined
by the judge.  A waiver is valid only upon acceptance by the court following a
judicial determination that the person understands the person's rights and is
competent to waive them, or is unable to participate.  If the person is unable
to participate, the judge shall appoint a guardian ad litem or a temporary
guardian as provided in article V of chapter 560, to represent the person
throughout the proceedings.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (d)  Hearings may be held at
a convenient location within the circuit where the person who is the subject of
the petition resides or any other circuit deemed appropriate by the court.  The
person or any interested person may request a hearing in another circuit
because of convenience to the parties, witnesses, or the court, or because of
the person's mental or physical condition.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (e)  The attorney general,
the attorney general's deputy, special deputy, or appointee shall present the
case for hearings convened under this section. </span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (f)  Counsel for the person
who is the subject of the petition shall be allowed adequate time for
investigation of the matters at issue and for preparation, and shall be
permitted to present evidence that the counsel believes necessary to a proper
disposition of the proceedings.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (g)  No person who is the
subject of the petition shall be found to require care or treatment unless at
least one physician or psychologist who has personally examined the person
testifies in person at the hearing.  This testimony may be waived by the
person.  If the subject has refused to be examined by a licensed physician or
psychologist, the person may be examined by a court-appointed licensed
physician or psychologist.  If the person refuses and there is sufficient
evidence to believe that the allegations of the petition are true, the person's
refusal shall be treated as a denial that the person is mentally ill or
suffering from substance abuse.  Nothing in this section shall limit the
person's privilege against self-incrimination.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (h)  The person who is the
subject of the petition in a hearing under this section has the right to secure
an independent medical or psychological evaluation at the person's own expense
and present evidence thereon.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (i)  If the court finds that
the criteria for involuntary medical treatment under section 353-13.6 have been
met by clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order to authorize
the department to involuntarily medically treat the person for a period of up
to one year unless the person is sooner released or sooner determined to no
longer be in need of treatment.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span lang=X-NONE>     (j)  The court may find that
the person who is the subject of the petition is an incapacitated or protected
person, or both, under article V of chapter 560, and may appoint a guardian or
conservator, or both, for the person under the terms and conditions as the
court shall determine</span>. <span lang=X-NONE>[L 2011, c 72, pt of §2]</span></p>
