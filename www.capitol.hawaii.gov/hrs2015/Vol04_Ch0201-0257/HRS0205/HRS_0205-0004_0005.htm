paragraph, and the requirement is the sole reason for failure to obtain
mortgage financing, then the requirement of encumbrances shall, insofar as such
mortgage financing is jeopardized, be conditionally waived by the appropriate

contrary, agricultural lands may be subdivided and leased for the agricultural
uses or activities permitted in subsection (a); provided that:</p>

agriculture;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  No permanent or temporary dwellings or farm

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000
(RLUIPA), assuming it was constitutional, did not facially invalidate Hawaii's
land use law, where plaintiffs challenged this section and §205-6 to the extent
the sections required a religious organization to obtain a special use permit,
as violations of the &quot;equal terms&quot; and &quot;nondiscrimination&quot;
provisions of the RLUIPA.  229 F. Supp. 2d 1056 (2002).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Communications equipment buildings&quot; and
&quot;utility lines&quot; in subsection (a)(7) do not encompass
&quot;telecommunications antennas&quot; or &quot;transmission antennas&quot;
such as a cellular telephone tower; public utility thus had to apply for a
special permit under §205-6 to place the tower in a state agricultural
district.  90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under subsection (a)(4) and (10), a chimney and garage are
permitted as accessories to a farm dwelling; however, utilizing the chimney to
conceal an antenna and the garage to house communication equipment were not
permitted uses under either subsection (a)(4) or (10).  106 H. 343, 104 P.3d
930 (2005).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the circumstances of the case, the residence and the
chimney with the concealed antenna constituted a &quot;communications equipment
building&quot; and, thus, were permitted uses under subsection (a)(7); also, as
the garage was not abnormally large and was designed specifically to store the communications
equipment for the concealed antenna, utilizing the permitted garage structure
to house the communications equipment for the antenna was a permitted use under
subsection (a)(7).  106 H. 343, 104 P.3d 930 (2005).</p>
