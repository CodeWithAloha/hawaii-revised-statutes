<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[</b><b>§201&#8209;8.5]  Night sky
protection strategy. </b> (a)  Beginning July 1, 2014, all state agencies shall
comply with shielded lighting fixture requirements under this section, whereby,
except as specified otherwise in subsections (c) through (f), every new outdoor
lamp light fixture emitting more than three thousand lumens shall be required
to be fully shielded and to have a correlated color temperature of four
thousand Kelvin or less; provided that the impact of artificial light on
shoreline and ocean waters shall be subject to compliance with section 205A&#8209;71. 
A lighting fixture is considered to be fully shielded when the lighting fixture
is shielded in such a manner that all light rays emitted by the fixture, either
directly from the lamp, or indirectly from the fixture, are projected below a
horizontal plane running through the lowest point of the fixture.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  No new mercury vapor lamps shall be sold
or installed after July 1, 2014.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  As applicable, retrofit work or
replacement of existing lighting fixtures shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Limit the rated correlated color temperature of
emitted light (lamp, fixture, and filter if used) to less than or equal to four
thousand Kelvin, except in the case of outdoor athletic facilities as described
in subsection (d);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Not be subject to the shielding requirement for
lamp-by-lamp replacement work; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Require one hundred per cent fully shielded
lighting fixtures be installed if more than fifty per cent of existing
nonconforming lighting fixtures need to be replaced.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For outdoor athletic facilities, fully
shielded lighting fixtures with correlated color temperatures less than or
equal to four thousand Kelvin are preferred, but not required.  Where fully
shielded lighting fixtures are not used, acceptable luminaries shall include
light fixtures that are:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Equipped with internal, external, or internal and
external glare control louvers and are installed so as to limit direct up-light
to less than five per cent of the total lumens exiting from the installed
fixtures and minimize offsite light trespass; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Installed and maintained with minimum aiming
angles of twenty-five degrees downward from the horizontal; provided that the
aiming angle shall be measured from the axis of the luminaire maximum beam
candlepower, as certified by an independent testing agency.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Fully shielded replacement lighting
fixtures for state managed roadways and highways shall be installed on a
case-by-case basis, subject to the availability of capital improvement project
funding and compliance with applicable federal, state, or county design
standards or guidelines.  Where fully shielded fixtures are not used,
acceptable luminaires shall be partially shielded lights that emit no more than
five per cent of their light above the horizontal plane, as certified by an
independent testing agency.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The use of existing nonconforming lighting
fixtures shall be allowed, subject to compliance with subsection (c)(3), <span
style='color:black'>for:</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Lighting fixtures that are extinguished between
the hours of 11:00 p.m. and sunrise by an automatic shutoff device; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Outdoor amphitheaters, ballparks, playfields,
play courts, or other similar recreational facilities, whether public or
private, that are used for international, national, state, or county
tournaments; or as needed to conclude any recreational event, sporting event,
or other related clean up activity that is in progress prior to 11:00 p.m. at
the amphitheater, ballpark, playfield, play court, or similar recreational
facility.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The following light sources shall be
exempt from this section:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Lighting sources emitting three thousand lumens
or less, which is comparable to a lighting fixture with an incandescent lamp
rated at one hundred fifty watts or less, and temporary ornamental holiday
lights;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Emergency lighting used by military, national
guard, police, firefighters, correctional, medical, or hazardous material
mitigation personnel, or other emergency responders for the duration of the
emergency;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Temporary outdoor lighting used for construction
or major renovation of buildings or for highway improvements or construction;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Temporary outdoor lighting used for film
production and other permitted activities such as carnivals and concerts;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Temporary outdoor lighting used for agricultural operations;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Navigational lights that are required for
waterway, open ocean, and aircraft safety;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Existing outdoor lighting fixtures that were
legally installed prior to July 1, 2014, subject to compliance with subsection
(c)(3);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Outdoor lighting fixtures that are necessary for
compliance with applicable federal, state, or county design standards or
guidelines that are related to health and safety for the general public;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span style='color:black'>     (9)  Upwards facing lighting
fixtures used to illuminate buildings, monuments, statues, memorial structures,</span>
national or state flags, and other selected facilities or features that were
legally installed prior to July&nbsp;1, 2014, or that will result in the
generation of three thousand lumens or less, as certified by an independent
testing agency; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span style='color:black'>    (10)  Refurbishment, repair,
or replacement-in-kind of lighting fixtures that are character-defining
features of a historic property, as determined by the department of land and
natural resources historic preservation division</span>.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  This section shall be considered to be
supplemental to any adopted county lighting ordinances and shall not be
construed to supersede or modify county lighting ordinances or rules; provided
that the county ordinance is not less restrictive than this section; and
provided further that this section shall not apply to counties with populations
of less than one hundred thousand persons. [L 2012, c 287, §2]</p>
