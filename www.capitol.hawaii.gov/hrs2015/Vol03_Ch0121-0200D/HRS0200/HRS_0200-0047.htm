<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§200-47  Disposition of proceeds.  </b><i>[Section
effective until June 30, 2015.  For section effective July 1, 2015, see below.]</i> 
A state or county agency that sells a vessel pursuant to this part shall
deposit that portion of the proceeds of the sale of the vessel that represents
the mooring or other fees and charges due the agency, the expenses of the
auction, and any other expense incurred by the agency in taking into custody
and disposing of an abandoned vessel, derelict vessel, or vessel impounded
under section 200-16, into the boating special fund or other state or county
fund, as appropriate, from which the expenses incurred in connection with the
vessel were paid.  The balance, if any, shall be deposited into the general
fund of the State.  The owner may recover any balance of the proceeds from the
State only if the owner files a claim therefor with the department of budget
and finance within one year after the execution of the bill of sale.  If no
claim is made within the year allowed, the money shall become a state
realization.  A lien holder shall receive priority in payment from the balance
of the proceeds to the extent of the lien holder's lien on the vessel.  If the
proceeds of the sale are insufficient to cover the mooring and other fees and
charges, the expenses of the auction, and the other expenses incurred by the agency
in taking into custody and disposing of the vessel, the agency may bring an
action for the deficiency in a court of appropriate jurisdiction against the
registered or documented owner or any person who had an interest in the vessel
when custody was taken by the agency. [L 1991, c 272, pt of §2; am L 2004, c
70, §5; am L 2012, c 146, §6]</p>
