family members of crime shall have the following rights:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To be informed by the police and the prosecuting
attorney of the final disposition of the case.  If the crime charged is a
felony, the victim or a surviving immediate family member shall be notified of
major developments in the case and whenever the defendant or perpetrator is
released from custody.  The victim or a surviving immediate family member shall
also be consulted and advised about plea bargaining by the prosecuting
attorney;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  To be notified by the prosecuting attorney if a
court proceeding to which they have been subpoenaed will not proceed as
scheduled;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  To receive protection from threats or harm;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  To be informed by the police, victim/witness
counselor, or other criminal justice personnel, of financial assistance and
other social services available as a result of being a witness to or a victim
of crime, including information on how to apply for the assistance and
services;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  To be provided by the court, whenever possible,
with a secure waiting area during court proceedings that does not require them
to be in close proximity to defendants and families and friends of defendants;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  To have any stolen or other personal property
expeditiously returned by law enforcement agencies when the property is no
longer needed as evidence.  If feasible, all the property, except weapons,
currency, contraband, property subject to evidentiary analysis, and property,
the ownership of which is disputed, shall be returned to the person within ten
days of being taken; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  To be informed by the department of public safety
of changes planned by the department in the custodial status of the offender
that allows or results in the release of the offender into the community,
including escape, furlough, work release, placement on supervised release,
release on parole, release on bail bond, release on appeal bond, and final
discharge at the end of the prison term.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Upon written request, the victim or the
parent or guardian of a minor or incapacitated victim of an offense under
section 707-730, 707-731, or 707-732(1)(a) shall have the right to be informed
of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of the person who has been
convicted or a juvenile who has been adjudicated under that section and to
receive counseling regarding HIV.  The testing shall be performed according to
the protocols set forth in section 325-17.  Upon request of the victim, or the
parent or guardian of a minor or incapacitated victim, the department of health
shall provide counseling.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary,
the department of public safety, the Hawaii paroling authority, the judiciary
probation divisions and branches, and the department of the attorney general
shall make good faith efforts to notify the victim of a crime, or surviving
immediate family members of a victim, of income received by a person imprisoned
for that crime when the imprisoned person has received a civil judgment that
exceeds $10,000, a civil settlement that exceeds $10,000, or any income that
exceeds $10,000 in one fiscal year, whenever the income is known to the agency,
and, in addition, the department of public safety shall make good faith efforts
to notify the victim of a crime or surviving immediate family members of a
victim, whenever it is known to the agency that a person imprisoned for that
crime has a financial account, of which the department of public safety is
aware, of a value exceeding $10,000.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary,
payment of restitution and judgments to victims, or surviving immediate family
members of a victim, shall be a precondition for release on parole for any
imprisoned person whom the Hawaii paroling authority determines has the
financial ability to make complete or partial restitution payments or complete
or partial judgment payments to the victim of the person's crime, or to the
surviving immediate family members of a victim.</p>

the State of Hawaii, any political subdivision of the State of Hawaii, any
department or agency of the State, any officer of the State, and any employee
of the State shall be immune from damages in any lawsuit based on noncompliance
with subsection (c) or (d).  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
prevent disciplinary action against any employee of the State who intentionally
fails to comply with subsection (c) or (d) after being warned that compliance
is required. [L 1988, c 261, pt of §1; am L 1990, c 164, §29; am L 1991, c 84,
