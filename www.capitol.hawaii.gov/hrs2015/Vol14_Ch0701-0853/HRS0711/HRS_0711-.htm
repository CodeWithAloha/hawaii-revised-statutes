necessary for the health of the animal and is kept reasonably clean and free from
excess waste or other contaminants that could affect the animal's health;
provided that the area of confinement in a primary pet enclosure must:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Provide access to shelter;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Be constructed of safe materials to
protect the pet animal from injury;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Enable the pet animal to be clean, dry,
and free from excess waste or other contaminants that could affect the pet
animal's health;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  Provide the pet animal with a solid
surface or resting platform that is large enough for the pet animal to lie upon
in a normal manner, or, in the case of a caged bird a perch that is large
enough for the bird to perch upon in a normal manner;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  Provide sufficient space to allow the pet
animal to, at minimum, do the following:</p>

<p class=iClause>              (i)  Easily stand, sit, lie, turn around, and
make all other normal body movements in a comfortable manner for the pet
animal, without making physical contact with any other animal in the enclosure;
and</p>

<p class=iClause>             (ii)  Interact safely with other animals within
the enclosure; and</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (5)  Veterinary care when needed to prevent

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1100</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section is definitional only and, of course, specifies
no offense.  A discussion of the definitions in this section, when needed or
appropriate, is found in the commentary to the substantive offenses employing
the terms defined.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §711-1100</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Code as adopted added Items (5) and (6).  The Proposed
Draft did not contain these items.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 192, Session Laws 1986, amended the definition of &quot;animal&quot;
to exclude human beings, thereby foreclosing the possible interpretation of the
statute to include within the offense persons engaged in boxing.  House
Conference Committee Report No. 37-86, Senate Conference Committee Report No.
27-86, and House Standing Committee Report No. 392.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 292, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;facsimile&quot; to strengthen the laws against
harassment.  Conference Committee Report No. 57.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended this section by adding
the definitions of &quot;pet animal&quot; and &quot;necessary sustenance.&quot; 
Act 173 protected pet animals in Hawaii from neglect by defining minimum
standards of care.  The legislature found that pet animals deserved at least
the minimum care of food, water, and protection from the elements.  Act 173
established guidelines to be used to prevent the neglect and abuse of pet
animals.  Conference Committee Report No. 87.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by adding the
definition of &quot;record.&quot;  The legislature found that advancement in
technology has provided opportunity for &quot;video voyeurism&quot; in public
places.  A change in the offense of violation of privacy would address the
growing concern for the offensive practice of &quot;upskirt photography.&quot; 
House Standing Committee Report No. 1316.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 83, Session Laws 2004, amended the definition of &quot;record&quot;
to include digital recordings within the purview of privacy offenses.  Act 83
made statutory amendments to the existing privacy law in order to prohibit the
inappropriate use of new digital technologies, such as cellular phones, that
are capable of taking digital photographs and transmitting those images.  House
Standing Committee Report No. 1174-04, Conference Committee Report No. 43-04.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 114, Session Laws 2007, amended this section by, among
other things, defining &quot;pet animal&quot; as a dog, cat, domesticated
rabbit, guinea pig, [domesticated pig,] or caged birds, so long as they are not
bred for consumption.  Act 114 strengthened Hawaii's animal cruelty laws.  The
legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must be not
tolerated in our society. Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse and the
commission of violent acts against humans.  Hawaii is only one of nine states
in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal abuse.  The
legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional bond and
relationship with their owners and family members and friends.  Violence and
harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional impact on their
owners and family.  The felony provisions of Act 114 protected pet animals. 
Conference Committee Report No. 29.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 111, Session Laws 2008, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;equine animal&quot;.  Act 111 extended to equine
animals some of the legal protections accorded to pet animals relating to
animal cruelty by making an offense involving serious bodily injury or death to
an equine animal a class C felony.  The legislature believed that horses belong
under the protection of law and that adding equine animals to the list of
animals protected under the animal cruelty law reflects the fact that companion
animals come in all shapes and sizes.  House Standing Committee Report No.
1589-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2879, Conference Committee Report
No. 20-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 147, Session Laws 2010, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;primary pet enclosure,&quot; and by amending the
definition of &quot;necessary sustenance&quot; to include the requirements of
an area of confinement in a primary pet enclosure and veterinary care when
needed to prevent suffering.  The legislature found that existing definitions
applicable to cruelty to animals lack specificity in the areas regarding a
primary pet enclosure and the range of care needed to sufficiently preserve a
pet animal's health and well-being.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2957,
Conference Committee Report No. 37-10.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 205, Session Laws 2013, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;law enforcement animal.&quot;  Act 205 amended §§711-1109.4
and 711-1109.5 to protect law enforcement animals in the line of duty.  The
legislature found that law enforcement animals are an integral part of Hawaii's
law enforcement and corrections agencies and are hand-selected and highly
trained for their jobs.   The animals diligently work side-by-side with law
enforcement officers, deputies, and other personnel and should be afforded
special protections.  Conference Committee Report No. 128.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§711-1101  Disorderly conduct.</b>  (1)  A
person commits the offense of disorderly conduct if, with intent to cause
physical inconvenience or alarm by a member or members of the public, or
recklessly creating a risk thereof, the person:</p>

<p class=aPenalBlock>     (a)  Engages in fighting or threatening, or in

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  Noise is unreasonable, within the meaning
of subsection (1)(b), if considering the nature and purpose of the person's
conduct and the circumstances known to the person, including the nature of the
location and the time of the day or night, the person's conduct involves a
gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding citizen would
follow in the same situation; or the failure to heed the admonition of a police
officer that the noise is unreasonable and should be stopped or reduced.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The renter, resident, or owner-occupant of the
premises who knowingly or negligently consents to unreasonable noise on the
premises shall be guilty of a noise violation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  Disorderly conduct is a petty misdemeanor
if it is the defendant's intention to cause substantial harm or serious
inconvenience, or if the defendant persists in disorderly conduct after
reasonable warning or request to desist.  Otherwise disorderly conduct is a
violation. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1973, c 136, §9(a); am L 1974, c 164,

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1101</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The offense of &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; has been very
broadly defined in the past (see below) to include numerous petty annoyances to
the public.  Section 711-1101 gives a far narrower definition to the offense,
both because some of the matters previously treated under that heading are now
treated elsewhere and because some of the previous provisions seem unwise.  The
section requires proof of an intent to cause physical inconvenience or alarm,
or at least a reckless creation of a risk thereof.  Subsection (1)(a) is a
standard clause in disorderly conduct legislation, aimed at actual fights and
at other behavior tending to threaten the public generally, for this section
requires public alarm, etc., as distinguished from the private alarm which may
accompany assault.  This is an important point.  A person may not be arrested
for disorderly conduct as a result of activity which annoys only the police,
for example.[1]  Police officers are trained and employed to bear the burden of
hazardous situations, and it is not infrequent that private citizens have
arguments with them.  Short of conduct which causes &quot;physical
inconvenience or alarm to a member or members of the public&quot; arguments
with the police are merely hazards of the trade, which do not warrant criminal
penalties.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (1)(c) is directed at &quot;free&quot; speech
which exceeds the bounds of constitutional protection.  It is important not to
limit free expression, so the formula adopted--&quot;offensively
coarse&quot;--is meant to apply only to obscene and scatalogical language, and
not to language that is politically or religiously offensive.  The defendant
must know, or must consciously disregard the risk, that the defendant's coarse
language will be offensive.  The subsection also prohibits abusive language
likely to evoke a violent reaction from the hearer (though no such reaction
need be proved) in order that the public peace will be promoted by its
prohibition.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (1)(d) is defined to include creation of a
hazardous or physically offensive condition by an act not covered by any
authorized license or permit.  It would prohibit, for example, the use of a
&quot;stink bomb,&quot; strewing garbage or other noxious substances in public
places, and turning off the lights in a public auditorium.  Although there is some
degree of overlap in some situations between this provision and §708-828
(criminal use of noxious substances) and §708-829 (criminal littering),
subsection (1)(d) is needed to cover those cases of public annoyance where a
private property owner does not wish to file a complaint or where title to
property is not clear.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Disorderly conduct is a violation unless it is the
defendant's intention to cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience, or if
the defendant persists in disorderly conduct after a reasonable warning or
request to desist.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The previous Hawaii statute covered a wide range of
activity.  The text of the former statute follows:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>       Any person
who with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or whereby a breach of the
peace may be occasioned, commits any of the following acts shall be deemed to

offensive, disorderly, threatening, abusive or insulting language, conduct or
behavior;</p>

<p class=XNotes>The above offense of disorderly conduct was punishable by a
fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or
both.[3]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  It should be noted that all of the conduct covered by the
previous law, except that included in paragraphs (6), (7), and (11), is covered
by various sections of this chapter, if not by the offense of disorderly
conduct itself.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §711-1101</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When the Legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it changed the
wording of the Proposed Draft's subsection (1)(c), which is now subsection
(1)(d).  The Proposed Draft had recommended that the offense apply where the
perpetrator commits an act &quot;which serves no legitimate purpose of the
actor.&quot;  The Legislature changed that phrase to any act &quot;which is not
performed under any authorized license or permit&quot;, since it felt the
language of the Proposed Draft was unconstitutionally vague.  Conference
Committee Report No. 2 (1972).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 136, Session Laws 1973, made two amendments.  The offense
of disorderly conduct was amended to require an intent to cause physical
inconvenience or alarm by members of the public.  Previously, the offense
merely required an intent to cause &quot;public inconvenience, annoyance, or
alarm.&quot;  In addition, subsection (1)(b) (now subsection (1)(c)) was
changed by adding the language &quot;which is likely to provoke a violent
response&quot; after the word &quot;present.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 164, Session Laws 1974, further amended the section by
clarifying the offense when it involved the making of unreasonable noise. 
Conduct involving a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law
abiding citizen would follow would be a violation of this provision.  Senate
Standing Committee Report No. 967-74, states:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in'>  &quot;The addition of a new
subsection (2) defines the quality of unreasonable noise, as a general
principle of penal liability, used throughout the Hawaii Penal Code, which can
be found in §702-206.  This definition sets forth an intelligent, flexible and
reasonable standard by which enforcement of this provision can be made.  The
enforcement of this section is not intended to interfere with reasonable
necessary commercial activities justifiable in their profession or trade and
technologically tenable.  For example, it is not an offense that commercial
activity causes inconvenience upon a person or persons if, considering the
nature and purpose of such activity and the circumstances surrounding the activity
including the location, the nature of the day (whether a weekend or a holiday)
and the time of the day or night, such activity is reasonable and prudent.</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in'>  Your Committee has categorically
ruled out the argument that people who sleep during the day should not bear a
greater burden than those people who sleep at night.  We are well aware that
because of Hawaii's diverse educational, commercial and recreational
activities, some people have to sleep during the day through a degree of noise
activity.  But we believe that to limit the noise level of the day to that of
the night would impose a dangerous evil that will cause irreparable damage to
the general health and welfare of this state.  However, the Committee finds
that it is necessary to establish a reasonable standard that can be applied to
all noise situations and not just the quiet of the night.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Enforcement of proposed decible standards is impractical at
this time.  The state of the art and present technology do not lend themselves
to an acceptable justification for their use in everyday enforcement.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 182, Session Laws 1978, added subsection (1)(e). 
Conference Committee Report (Senate No. 31-78, House No. 27) states:  &quot;The
conduct which your Committee believes should be regulated is the impeding and
obstructing while begging in a public place or place open to the public.  Your
Committee does not find that the specific conduct of begging alone is offensive
but begging done in the specified manner which is offensive to the public
should be regulated.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 79, Session Laws 1979, added subsection (2) in order to
clarify the offense of unreasonable noise.  Conference Committee Report No. 63
states:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in'>  &quot;Your Committee finds that
under current statutes, in order to convict a person under the disorderly
conduct statute for making unreasonable noise, one must prove that such
person's actions involved a gross deviation from the standard of conduct of a
law- abiding citizen.  Prosecution has been difficult using this broad, if not
vague, definition.  This bill authorizes any police officer to make a
determination of what is unreasonable noise and makes the failure of a person
to heed his warning a punishable offense.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 79 also holds a renter, resident or owner-occupant of a
premises guilty of a noise violation if he knowingly or negligently consents to
unreasonable noise on his premises.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by updating
the crime of disorderly conduct to punish &quot;video voyeurism&quot; in public
places.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 637.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1102</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section provides a procedure under which a peace officer
can order a group of six or more persons participating in a course of
disorderly conduct likely to cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience,
annoyance, or alarm to disperse.  A similar order may be made to others in the
immediate vicinity.  Failure to obey such an order is a misdemeanor.  The
offense is thus an aggravated form of disorderly conduct which does not reach
the point of riot or unlawful assembly.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law contained a somewhat similar section,
allowing an order to disperse after &quot;force or violence has been used
disturbing the public peace.&quot;[1]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Double jeopardy did not bar retrial with regard to
defendant's failure to disperse from the first floor of a shopping mall under
this section, for which there was clearly sufficient evidence to support a
conviction, where defendant was not expressly acquitted by the jury,
defendant's conviction could not be assumed to include an implied acquittal on
either of the acts offered by the prosecution to support the conviction,
defendant was not convicted on a lesser included offense, and the jury did not
refuse to convict defendant on the basis of either act on the first or second
floor or choose between them.  124 H. 43, 237 P.3d 1109 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There was insufficient evidence that defendant violated this
section by failing to disperse from the second floor of a shopping mall where
officer did not testify concerning how long defendant remained on the second
floor after officer ordered the crowd to disperse, other than observing that
officer saw defendant again on the first floor at least twenty minutes later;
defendant's presence on the first floor at least twenty minutes later indicated
that defendant complied with the officer's order to disperse.  124 H. 43, 237
P.3d 1109 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There was sufficient evidence that defendant violated this
section by failing to disperse from the first floor of a shopping mall where
defendant was one of &quot;six or more persons participating in a course of
disorderly conduct&quot; or that defendant was in the &quot;immediate vicinity&quot;
of such a disturbance, officer ordered defendant to leave the area and had to
tell the defendant &quot;maybe ten more times&quot;, defendant would not leave,
and thus failed to comply with the order.  124 H. 43, 237 P.3d 1109 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As this section's limit on freedom of association and
movement is only within the immediate vicinity of the disorderly conduct and

is reasonably necessary for law enforcement to order those participating in the
disorderly conduct and those in the immediate vicinity to disperse until the

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1103</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In light of recent demonstrations by students and other
militants, the importance of well-drafted statutes relating to riot, unlawful
assembly, and disorderly conduct is self-evident.  The goal is, on the one
hand, not to curtail legitimate exercise of the rights of free speech and free
assembly and, on the other hand, to give the police a useful tool to employ
against conduct which involves crime or physical danger and which is no longer
afforded constitutional protection.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Riot is the most serious of the offenses against public
order.  It is made a class C felony both because of the greater number of
participants and because of the unlawful objectives.  At least six persons must
be involved (the defendant and five others) in &quot;disorderly conduct,&quot;
as that conduct is defined by §711-1101.  This number of participants is taken
from the previous Hawaii law and the Proposed Michigan Revised Criminal Code in
preference to the Model Penal Code's smaller number of participants (three). 
Because §711-1103 defines riot in terms of aggravated disorderly conduct, it is
necessary to prove the elements of disorderly conduct specified in §711-1101. 
In addition, there must be proof of one of two specified aggravating
circumstances.  Under subsection (1)(a) the accused must intend to commit or
facilitate the commission of a felony.  Subsection (1)(b) makes disorderly
conduct riot when the accused or any other participant to the accused's
knowledge uses or intends to use a dangerous instrument.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 711-1103 is restrictively worded to prevent the use
of the section to break up orderly demonstrations, meetings, or processions
which happen to attract a hostile crowd, perhaps because unpopular views are
being expressed.  On the other hand, the section will be useful in breaking up
disorderly demonstrations which threaten harm in one of the specified ways.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  In the prior Hawaii law, riot was defined as:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in'>  Any use of force or violence
disturbing the public peace, or any threat or attempt to use such force or
violence, if accompanied by immediate power of execution, by six or more
persons acting together, and without authority or justification by law....[1]</p>

<p class=XNotes>The penalty for participating in any riot was a fine of not
more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than two years or both.[2]  There
is no case law existing under this particular statute.</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  Note on treason.</b>  Although a number of proposed penal
code revisions have included a crime of treason against the State, no such
crime is here included.  Treason is an offense amply covered in federal law,[3]
and is not likely to be directed against the State government.  It is the
position of the Code, therefore, that riot and the other offenses in this
chapter are sufficient to deal with any threat to the safety of the State.  In
fact, the crime of treason was not previously covered by Hawaii law, although there
were numerous sections, repealed by this revision, which covered various
treasonous activities.  Those sections are discussed below.  It will readily be
seen that the sections in this chapter and in chapters 5 and 7 make it
unnecessary to deal so specifically with the activities previously covered by
Hawaii law.  Moreover, there was considerable doubt about the constitutionality
of some of the sections, particularly those relating to &quot;criminal
syndicalism,&quot; as they appeared to penalize speech and assembly rather than
any activities directed at carrying out treasonous goals.  To the extent that
these activities ought to be criminal, they are made so by the Code's
provisions on solicitation, conspiracy, attempt, terroristic threatening, riot,
unlawful assembly, and the like.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The former law on treasonous activities was embodied in a
number of provisions.  H.R.S. §§721-1 to 721-5 prohibited anarchistic
publications and criminal syndicalism.  Anarchistic publications were those
which advocated or were intended to advocate &quot;the commission of any act of
violence, such as sabotage, incendiarism, sedition, anarchy, rioting or breach
of the peace...&quot;[4]  The printing, selling, or distribution of such
anarchistic publications was punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or
imprisonment for not more than one year.  Upon a second conviction for the same
offense within five years from the first conviction, a fine of not more than
$5,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, could be
imposed.[5]  Criminal syndicalism was defined as &quot;the doctrine which
advocates crime, sabotage, violence, or other unlawful methods of terrorism as
a means of accomplishing industrial or political ends.&quot;[6]  Committing
criminal syndicalism in its various forms was punishable by a fine of not more
than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than ten years.[7]  Two or more
persons were prohibited from assembling for the purpose of advocating or
teaching the doctrine of criminal syndicalism.  The penalty for so doing was a
fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or
both.[8]  Knowingly permitting the use of a building for unlawful assembly was
punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than
one year, or both.[9]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Intentional injury to or interference with property
(sabotage) was prohibited as follows:</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>     Whoever
wilfully destroys, impairs, injures, interferes, or tampers with real or
personal property intending or having reasonable grounds to believe that such
act will hinder, delay or interfere with the preparation of the United States
or of any of the states or territories for defense or for war, or with the
prosecution of war by the United States, shall be fined not more than $10,000
or imprisoned at hard labor not more than twenty years, or both.[10]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The same penalty was imposed for industrial sabotage
(intentionally defective workmanship) of any article or thing to be used in
connection with the preparation by the United States or any state or territory
for defense or for war.[11]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Besides the above, the use of disloyal or contemptuous
language concerning the United States, its armed forces, or its flag, or the
commission of an act of disloyalty which was reasonably calculated to cause a
breach of the peace was punishable by a fine of not less than $100 nor more
than $1,000, or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both.[12]  The use
of pacifistic language during a time of war was punishable by a fine of not
more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.[13]</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 711-1104 is intended to reach those who have
assembled for the purpose of rioting or who are on their way to the scene of a
riot, but who have not yet begun to riot, or who associate with a group of
known potential rioters with intent to aid their cause.  It thus comprises both
unlawful assembly and riot at the common law, and constitutes in effect an
expanded concept of attempted riot.  Punishment is at the misdemeanor level. </p>

<p class=XNotes>  Specifically the section requires assembling with five or
more others with intent to engage in conduct constituting a riot, or remaining
at an assembly that develops a purpose to engage in a riot, with intent to
advance that purpose. </p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law was directed at only specific instances
of unlawful assembly.  It was illegal under prior law to assemble for the
purpose of advocating criminal syndicalism,[1] also, under the former
disorderly conduct statute, it was illegal for persons congregating on a public
street or sidewalk to refuse to move on at the orders of the police.[2]  Thus,
the Code's concept of unlawful assembly as an attempted riot offense is new to
Hawaii law. </p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1105</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although obstructing was formerly covered by the disorderly
conduct statute, it raises certain important problems which indicate that it
should have separate treatment.  Primarily the problems relate to free speech
and types of expressive conduct which, under the aegis of free speech, are
constitutionally protected.  Normally, the act of obstructing a public highway
presents a great public inconvenience and serves no useful purpose.  However,
where the obstruction is caused by a crowd listening to a speaker, or even by a
crowd protesting some official action, important goals are served by leaving
the group as free from restriction as possible.  The proposed section
accomplishes these objectives.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (1) defines obstructing as knowing or reckless
obstruction of any highway or public passage.  &quot;Obstructs&quot; is defined
in §711-1100 as &quot;renders impassable without unreasonable inconvenience or
hazard.&quot;  This conduct constitutes a violation, and if the defendant fails
to heed a warning by a peace officer, it may be treated as a petty
misdemeanor.  However, subsection (4) makes clear that a person does not
violate subsection (1) solely because of the fact that people gather to hear
the person speak, or because the person is a member of such a gathering.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (2) is intended to allow reasonable control by
peace officers of a public gathering which obstructs highways or which is
dangerously close to a public hazard, such as a flood.  A person who fails to
heed a reasonable request by a peace officer in such circumstances is guilty of
a violation.  However, subsection (3) declares that a person engaged in speech
or other lawful behavior which attracts an obstructing crowd cannot be asked to
move if the obstruction can be readily remedied by police control.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law treated obstruction as a part of
disorderly conduct.[1]  The prior statute recognized and protected the rights
of the speaker, but it seems insufficient in that it did not protect the rights
of the listening audience.  The Code attempts to remedy this point.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1106</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Harassment, a petty misdemeanor, is a form of disorderly
conduct aimed at a single person, rather than at the public.  The intent to
harass, annoy, or alarm another person must be proved.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (1)(a) is a restatement of the common-law crime of
battery, which was committed by any slight touching of another person in a
manner which is known to be offensive to that person.  Such contacts are
prohibited, if done with requisite intent, in order to preserve the peace.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsection (1)(b) is likewise aimed at preserving peace.  It
prohibits insults, taunts, or challenges which are likely to provoke a violent
or disorderly response.  This is distinguished from disorderly conduct because
it does not present a risk of public inconvenience or alarm.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Subsections (1)(c) and (1)(d) are aimed at abusive
communications.  The former prohibits any telephone call which is made with the
specified intent and without any legitimate purpose.  The latter prohibits any
type of repeated communications which are anonymous, made at extremely
inconvenient times, or in offensively coarse language.  Again, the intent to
harass, annoy, or alarm must be proved.  Nearly all states have statutes
prohibiting such conduct.  Our aim is to make them broad enough to cover all
types of potentially annoying communications.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law treated various forms of harassment as
disorderly conduct.[1]  In addition the law expressly prohibited the use of
obscene or lascivious language over the telephone.[2]</p>

prohibiting a person from repeatedly making telephone calls, facsimile, or

deleting the requirement that various kinds of communications cause the
recipient to reasonably believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury
or property damage; and making it a separate offense to make a communication
using offensively coarse language that would cause the recipient to reasonably
believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury or property damage.

<p class=XNotes>  Act 90, Session Laws 2009, amended subsection (1) by

as other verbal communications or offensive contacts.  Senate Standing

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant police officer and defendant resident manager had
probable cause to arrest plaintiff for harassment.  855 F. Supp. 1167 (1994).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff firearm permit applicant's allegations that
plaintiff was denied a permit and ordered to surrender plaintiff's weapons
because of a conviction of harassment more than ten years before under this
section and that the conviction was not a crime of violence under §134-7(b) or
federal law for the purposes of prohibiting ownership or possession of firearms
were sufficient to state a 42 U.S.C. §1983 claim for a violation of plaintiff's
Second Amendment rights.  869 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Elements of harassment construed.  60 H. 540, 592 P.2d 810
(1979).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Threatening and offensive remarks directed against police
afforded police probable cause to arrest for harassment.  61 H. 291, 602 P.2d
933 (1979).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Harassment is not a lesser included offense of assault in the
third degree in violation of §707-712.  63 H. 1, 620 P.2d 250 (1982).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Harassment not a lesser included offense of disorderly
conduct.  63 H. 548, 632 P.2d 654.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Person charged with petty misdemeanor carrying maximum
penalty of thirty days confinement, a fine, or both, is not entitled to jury
trial.  64 H. 374, 641 P.2d 978.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where minor's challenge to officer was not uttered in a
manner likely to provoke a violent response on officer's part, there was
insufficient evidence to support district family court's conclusion that minor
committed offense of harassment in violation of subsection (1)(b).  76 H. 85,
869 P.2d 1304 (1994).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because the broad language of §708-810 does not evidence an
intent to confine crimes &quot;against a person&quot; to those enumerated in
chapter 707, and harassment is a crime against a person, a conviction for
burglary under §708-810 may be predicated on the offense of harassment.  89 H.
284, 972 P.2d 287 (1998).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  An &quot;illegitimate purpose&quot; is not an element of the
offense of harassment, as defined by subsection (1)(a); where substantial
evidence that, after becoming angry and &quot;yelling&quot; at son, defendant
slapped son in the face, trial court could reasonably have inferred that
defendant intended defendant's conduct to &quot;annoy&quot; or &quot;alarm&quot;
son.  90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399 (1999).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellate court correctly held that there was sufficient
evidence to sustain defendant's harassment conviction under subsection (1)(a)
where defendant chose to slap minor in the face and strike minor with a bamboo
stick at least five times with enough force to leave red welts visible the next
day; based on the totality of circumstances in the case, substantial evidence
existed to support the conclusion that the State proved beyond a reasonable
doubt that the force defendant employed against minor was without due regard
for minor's age and size, thus disproving defendant's parental justification
defense under §703-309.  126 H. 494, 273 P.3d 1180 (2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where appellate record referred to multiple cases in which a
stay had been denied to petty misdemeanants pending appeal, indicating that the
denial of a request for a stay of sentence appeared to be an issue that could
potentially affect many petty misdemeanor defendants, was likely to recur in
the future, and because there was no definitive case law on when the issuance
of a stay after a petty misdemeanor conviction was appropriate, appellate court
erred in not addressing the family court's failure to stay defendant's sentence
pending appeal based on the mootness doctrine because the public interest
exception applied.  126 H. 494, 273 P.3d 1180 (2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Conviction reversed where defendant merely drove his
automobile along narrow street in opposite direction from automobile of former
girlfriend and did not insult, taunt, or challenge.  7 H. App. 582, 788 P.2d
173 (1990).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Record did not support a finding that defendant either
insulted, taunted, or challenged dog owner, or that defendant did so in a
manner likely to provoke a violent response.  77 H. 196 (App.), 881 P.2d 1264
(1994).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant came up behind victim unexpectedly and
threatened victim, screamed a 10-minute tirade at victim, and were actions
taken without significant provocation or cognizable justification, facts
sufficient to enable a reasonable person to conclude defendant violated
subsection (1)(b).  93 H. 513 (App.), 6 P.3d 385 (2000).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's conviction under this section vacated where trial
court's ruling that defendant engaged in &quot;reckless&quot; conduct did not
satisfy the specific intent requirement of this section.  95 H. 290 (App.), 22
P.3d 86 (2001).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the plain meaning of subsection (1)(a), &quot;offensive
physical contact&quot; encompassed the conduct of defendant knocking off police
officer's hat--offensive contact that, while separate and apart from the various
forms of actual bodily touching, nevertheless involved contact with an item
physically appurtenant to the body.  95 H. 290 (App.), 22 P.3d 86 (2001).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Sufficient evidence supported trial court's finding that
defendant committed offense of harassment.  98 H. 459 (App.), 50 P.3d 428
(2002).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant's conviction of harassment under this section
reversed where trial court erroneously concluded that father's actions could
not be seen as reasonably necessary to protect the welfare of the recipient,
and the State failed its burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt the
justification evidence that was adduced, or proving beyond a reasonable doubt
facts negativing the justification defense under §703-309.  106 H. 252 (App.),
103 P.3d 412 (2004).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because there was no provision in §706-605 for the imposition
of anger management or other treatment programs, but §706-624(2)(j) authorized
the imposition of, inter alia, mental health treatment as a discretionary term
of probation, district court erred by sentencing defendant to both the
thirty-day term of imprisonment (the maximum term of imprisonment for a petty
misdemeanor) and anger management classes for defendant's harassment conviction
(a petty misdemeanor).  Defendant could have been sentenced to a thirty-day
term of incarceration or a six-month term of probation, but not both, and thus
defendant's sentence was illegal.  130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There was sufficient evidence to support the district court's
finding that defendant was not acting to protect defendant's girlfriend where
defendant's girlfriend was already the aggressor when defendant dragged victim
by the hair to support defendant's conviction of harassment under subsection
(1)(a).  Further, defendant's girlfriend's ex-husband testified that
defendant's girlfriend &quot;went for&quot; victim before defendant pulled
victim by victim's hair, thus negating defendant's defense-of-others
justification defense pursuant to §703-305.  130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033
(2013).</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 292, Session Laws 1992, created the offense of harassment
by stalking to strengthen the laws against harassment.  A person commits this offense
if, with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person, or in reckless
disregard of the risk thereof, a person pursues or conducts surveillance upon
another without legitimate purpose and under circumstances which would cause
the other to reasonably believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury
or property damage.  Conference Committee Report No. 57.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 68, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by requiring
the defendant to engage in a course of conduct involving pursuit, surveillance,
or nonconsensual contact on more than one occasion without legitimate purpose
and defining &quot;nonconsensual contact&quot; as any contact that occurs
without the individual's consent or in disregard of that person's express
desire that the contact be avoided or discontinued.  Act 68 also repealed the
distinction that a single occurrence of a prohibited conduct is a petty
misdemeanor.  Conference Committee Report No. 54, House Standing Committee
Report No. 1315.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 90, Session Laws 2009, amended subsection (3), clarifying
the definition of &quot;nonconsensual contact&quot; to include contact by means
of any form of electronic communication.  The legislature found that harassing
or insulting electronic communications are a form of harassment that can be
just as severe or punishing as other verbal communications or offensive
contacts.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1242.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant was convicted of harassment by stalking under
this section, which is not one of the sexual offenses defined in chapter 707,
part V or chapter 846E, trial court abused its discretion when it ordered
defendant to undergo sex offender treatment program participation as a
condition of probation without a sufficient factual basis that was reasonably
related to the nature and circumstances of the offense of harassment by
stalking, of which defendant was found guilty.  116 H. 403 (App.), 173 P.3d 550

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law prohibited certain types of desecration. 
For example, desecration of the United States flag was prohibited.[1]  Section
711-1107 deals more generally with all acts of desecration; i.e., acts of
physical damage to or mistreatment of venerated places and objects under
circumstances which the defendant knows are likely to outrage the sensibilities
of persons who observe or discover the defendant's actions.  Thus, any
desecration of a public monument or structure; or a place of worship or burial
(public or private); or, in a public place, the national flag, or any other
object (such as certain religious objects) revered by a substantial segment of
the public, will constitute an offense.  Damage by desecration is treated
separately from other types of property damage because the sense of outrage
produced by such acts is out of proportion to the monetary value of the
damage.  Thus, desecration is a misdemeanor, although many such cases might
otherwise be petty misdemeanors under §708-823 because the object desecrated is
worth less than $50.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 198, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by changing
the penalty for desecration from a misdemeanor to one year imprisonment, a fine
of $10,000, or both.  The legislature found that recent vandalism at cemeteries
denoted that the current financial penalties of a misdemeanor offense for
desecration were an insufficient deterrent.  The $10,000 fine was consistent
with the penalty in §6E-11(c), relating to destruction of historic property. 
The legislature believed that a burial place or grave deserved no less a
penalty for damage than did a historical monument.  Senate Standing Committee

does not, of course, relate to legally authorized activities of undertakers and

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1108.5</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 114, Session Laws 2007, created the offense of cruelty to
animals in the first degree, making it a felony to intentionally or knowingly
torture, mutilate, or poison or cause the torture, mutilation, or poisoning of
any pet animal resulting in serious bodily injury or death of the pet animal. 
The legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must be
not tolerated in our society.  Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse
and the commission of violent acts against humans.  Hawaii is only one of nine
states in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal
abuse.  The legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional
bond and relationship with their owners and family members and friends. 
Violence and harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional
impact on their owners and family.  The felony provisions of Act 114 protected
pet animals.  Conference Committee Report No. 29.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 111, Session Laws 2008, amended this section by making an
offense involving serious bodily injury or death to an equine animal a class C
felony, thus extending to equine animals some of the legal protections accorded
to pet animals relating to animal cruelty.  The legislature believed that
horses belong under the protection of law and that adding equine animals to the
list of animals protected under the animal cruelty law reflects the fact that
companion animals come in all shapes and sizes.  House Standing Committee
Report No. 1589-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2879, Conference
Committee Report No. 20-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 135, Session Laws 2011, amended this section to include
killing or attempting to kill any pet animal belonging to another person
without first obtaining legal authority or the consent of the pet animal's
owner, except for the humane euthanasia of an animal in accordance with
American Veterinary Medical Association accepted standards or conduct that the
actor believes necessary to avoid an imminent harm or evil to the actor,
another person, or an animal.  The legislature found that the existing language
of this section did not expressly address any method of killing a pet animal
other than torture, mutilation, or poisoning.  The legislature believed that
the loophole should be closed for several reasons.  The killing of a pet animal
for sport was not only abhorrent, but this type of aggressive behavior has
wider implications.  Animal abuse has connections to the abuse of family
members and may increase aggressive or violent tendencies in children who
witness their pets being abused or killed.  There were concerns that animal
abuse or killing perpetuates the cycle of violence because people who commit
acts of serious animal abuse frequently have histories of, or future tendencies
toward, violent crimes against humans.  By expressly making the killing of a
pet animal a criminal offense, the legislature intended to deter this conduct
and its grave effects.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 559, Conference
Committee Report No. 29.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 209, Session Laws 2013, amended this section to prohibit
persons convicted of cruelty to animals in the first degree from possessing or
owning any pet animal or equine animal for a minimum of five years from the
date of conviction.  The legislature found that Act 209 was based on the
concept that defendants convicted of cruelty to animals in the first degree
should no longer be afforded the privilege of owning a pet animal or equine animal.

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §§711-1109 TO 711-1110</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 192, Session Laws 1986, amended §711-1109 to provide that
the intentional, knowing, or reckless poisoning of an animal, except insects
and vermin, constitutes the offense of cruelty to animals.  The prohibition was
enacted in light of the increasing incidences of paraquat poisoning of animals
and because of the uncertainty of whether the present law applied to such
acts.  House Conference Committee Report No. 37-86, Senate Conference Committee
Report No. 27-86, House Standing Committee Report No. 392.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 711-1109.3 was added by Act 129, Session Laws 1983,
to prohibit the practice of dog fighting and its related activities.  While
those activities could be prosecuted under §711-1109, the legislature felt the
need to impose a more severe sanction than the misdemeanor penalty imposed in
that section.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 347, House Standing
Committee Report No. 1054.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended §711-1109 to provide that
depriving pet animals of necessary sustenance constitutes the crime of cruelty
to animals.  The legislature noted that the statute identified only those acts
which were the most heinous and extreme, such as beating, mutilation,
poisoning, starvation, and torture.  However, on a daily basis, other less
overt acts such as daily neglect also resulted in the inhumane treatment of
animals.  Thus, the legislature agreed that pet animals deserved a minimum
level of care including adequate food, water, and shelter.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 3222, Conference Committee Report No. 87.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 259, Session Laws 2002, added §§711-1109.4 and
711-1109.5, creating criminal offenses for causing injury or death to a guide
dog, signal dog, or service animal, and for intentional interference with the
use of a guide dog, signal dog, or service animal.  Act 259 recognized the
unique skills of guide dogs, signal dogs, and service animals that have
completed lengthy and specialized training to serve their owners with
disabilities.  The dogs have become the object of taunting and injury from people
or from other dogs.  Conference Committee Report No. 58-02.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 239, Session Laws 2006, added §§711-1109.1 and
711-1109.2, allowing:  (1) law enforcement officers to enter premises and
impound a pet animal when there is probable cause to believe the pet animal is
being subjected to cruel treatment; and (2) a court to order the forfeiture of
an impounded pet animal prior to the disposition of a criminal action against
the pet animal's owner.  The forfeiture was intended to pay for the animal's
care, not to punish the owner.  Act 239 provided a way to implement the legal
principle that, despite the impoundment, the obligation to provide adequate
care for the pet animal remains with the owner.  Conference Committee Report
No. 6-06, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2592.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 114, Session Laws 2007, strengthened Hawaii's animal
cruelty laws.  Act 114 amended §711-1109 by making conduct against any animal
resulting in substantial bodily injury a misdemeanor.  Act 114 also amended
§§711-1109.1 and 711-1109.2 by conforming the forfeiture provisions to apply to
the felony prohibitions of the Act.  Act 114 created the offense of cruelty to
animals in the first degree, making it a felony to intentionally or knowingly
torture, mutilate, or poison or cause the torture, mutilation, or poisoning of
any pet animal resulting in serious bodily injury or death of the pet animal. 
The legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must be
not tolerated in our society. Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse and
the commission of violent acts against humans.  Hawaii is only one of nine
states in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal
abuse.  The legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional
bond and relationship with their owners and family members and friends. 
Violence and harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional
impact on their owners and family.  The felony provisions of Act 114 protected
pet animals. Conference Committee Report No. 29.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 128, Session Laws 2008, added §711-1109.6, criminalizing
animal hoarding as a misdemeanor.  Act 128 was in response to recent incidences
of the keeping of a large number of animals, typically dogs and cats, without
providing adequate care to the animals.  The legislature found that animal
hoarding is an under-recognized community problem affecting both human and
animal welfare.  Act 128 sunsets on July 1, 2011.  Conference Committee Report
No. 45-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 128, Session Laws 2008, criminalized animal hoarding as a
misdemeanor in §711-1109.6, and made conforming amendments to §§711-1109.1 and
711-1109.2.  Act 128 sunsets on July 1, 2011.  Conference Committee Report No.
45-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 11, Session Laws 2009, provided for the reenactment of
§§711-1109.1(1) and 711-1109.2(1), (3), and (5) upon the repeal of Act 128,
Session Laws 2008.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 160, Session Laws 2009, amended §711-1109(1) and (2) to
clarify the offense of cruelty to animals in the second degree by including
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly:  (1) confining or causing to be
confined, in a kennel or cage, any pet animal in a cruel or inhumane manner; or
(2) tethering, fastening, tying, or restraining a dog to a doghouse, tree,
fence, or any other stationary object by means of a choke collar, pinch collar,
or prong collar; provided that a person is not prohibited from using the
restraints when walking a dog with a handheld leash or while a dog is engaged
in a supervised activity.  Conference Committee Report No. 85.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 160, Session Laws 2009, amended §711-1109.6(1) by
decreasing from [&quot;more than twenty&quot;] to &quot;more than fifteen,&quot;
the number of dogs, cats, or combination of dogs and cats required to be
possessed for the animal hoarding statute to apply.  Conference Committee
Report No. 85, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 590.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 160, Session Laws 2009, also extended the sunset date of
Act 128, Session Laws 2008, relating to animal hoarding, [affecting
§§711-1109.6, 711-1109.1, and 711-1109.2,] from July 1, 2011 to July 1, 2015. 
Conference Committee Report No. 85.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 149, Session Laws 2011, created a new offense,
§711-1109.35, cruelty to animals by fighting dogs in the second degree, a class
C felony.  Act 149 amended §711-1109.3 by converting the existing offense to
cruelty to animals by fighting dogs in the first degree, clarifying the
elements of the offense, and increasing the penalty from a class C felony to a
class B felony.  Act 149 also amended §§711-1109.1(1) and 711-1109.2(1), (3),
and (5) by adding cruelty to animals by fighting dogs to the offenses for which
a dog may be impounded or forfeited.  The legislature found that dogfighting is
a brutal practice which often results in the death of the participating dogs
within hours or days after the fight.  Also, because dogs used for fighting
have been bred for generations to be dangerously aggressive toward other
animals, the presence of the dogs in a community increases the risk of attacks
on not only other animals, but potentially on children, whose small size may cause
a fighting dog to perceive a child as another animal.  Hawaii ranked fiftieth
in a recent national ranking of the weakest state dogfighting laws, primarily
because Hawaii lacked a penalty for attending or wagering on an organized
dogfight.  Act 149 was intended to address the demand for dogfighting, in an
attempt to deter the callous practice.  Act 149 also specifically prohibited
the use of other animals as bait to train fighting dogs.  Bait animals are
often stolen animals, stray pets, or animals obtained through advertisements
that offer pets free to a good home.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 562,
House Standing Committee Report No. 1098.</p>

<p class=XNotes>   Act 149, Session Laws 2011, also provided for the
reenactment of §§711-1109.1(1) and  711-1109.2(1), (3), and (5) upon the repeal
of Act 128, Session Laws 2008, as amended by Act 160, Session Laws 2009.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 175, Session Laws 2011, amended §§711-1109.4 and
711-1109.5 to conform to the definition of &quot;service dog&quot; established
in chapter 347 by the Act.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1497.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 226, Session Laws 2011, amended §711-1109(1) by requiring
that any handling or extermination of insects, vermin, or other pests be
conducted in accordance with standard and acceptable pest control practices and
all applicable laws and regulations.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1300.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 25, Session Laws 2012, amended §711-1109.1 to add equine
animals to those animals that may be subject to impoundment in the course of an
animal cruelty case.  The legislature found that Hawaii's animal cruelty laws
acknowledged equine animals as companion animals like other pet animals that
typically have special meaning to or a relationship with their owners.  As
such, Act 25 provided the same protections to equine animals that are afforded
to pet animals.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2453, House Standing
Committee Report No. 1194-12.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 25, Session Laws 2012, amended §711-1109.2 by adding
equine animals to those animals that may be subject to forfeiture in the course
of an animal cruelty case, subsection (7) to allow a court discretion to
determine whether attorney's fees should be awarded to the petitioner following
the conviction of the defendant, and subsection (8) to clarify that a pet
animal or equine animal includes any offspring from a pet animal or equine
animal that was pregnant at the time of a rescue and born during the
impoundment of the pet animal and equine animal.  The legislature found that
Hawaii's animal cruelty laws acknowledged equine animals as companion animals
like other pet animals that typically have special meaning to or a relationship
with their owners.  However, the forfeiture law did not include equine animals
that are often held in limbo during animal cruelty investigations.  As such, Act
25 provided the same protections to equine animals that are afforded to pet
animals.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2453, House Standing Committee
Report No. 1194-12.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 205, Session Laws 2013, amended §711-1109.4 to include
recklessly causing substantial bodily injury to or death of any law enforcement
animal.  Act 205 also established that a violation is a class C felony and
provided restitution.  The legislature found that law enforcement animals are
an integral part of Hawaii's law enforcement and corrections agencies and are
hand-selected and highly trained for their jobs.  The animals diligently work
side-by-side with law enforcement officers, deputies, and other personnel and
should be afforded special protections.  Act 205 protected law enforcement
animals in the line of duty.  Conference Committee Report No. 128.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 205, Session Laws 2013, amended §711-1109.5 to include
intentionally or knowingly striking, beating, kicking, [cutting,] stabbing,
shooting, or administering any type of harmful substance or poison to a law
enforcement animal.  Act 205 provided certain exceptions to the offense,
established a violation as a misdemeanor, and provided restitution.  The
legislature found that law enforcement animals are an integral part of Hawaii's
law enforcement and corrections agencies and are hand-selected and highly
trained for their jobs.  The animals diligently work side-by-side with law
enforcement officers, deputies, and other personnel and should be afforded
special protections.  Act 205 protected law enforcement animals in the line of
duty.  Conference Committee Report No. 128.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 208, Session Laws 2013, added §711-1109.37, establishing
an animal cruelty offense for the use of steel-jawed leg-hold traps, or the use
of snares, conibear traps, and foot- or leg-hold traps in residential or other
prohibited areas.  The legislature found that this Act would allow for the use
of appropriate tools to control feral animals, such as pigs, goats, sheep,
deer, and wild cattle, where there is a potential for these animals to damage
natural resource areas, while at the same time establishing reasonable
additional protections for pet animals in residential areas, where they are
most likely to be inadvertently caught if certain animal control tools are
employed.  Act 208 also provided an exemption for state or federal employees to
use snares, conibear traps, and foot- or leg-hold traps in residential or other
prohibited areas for certain purposes.  Conference Committee Report No. 61.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 210, Session Laws 2013, amended §711-1109 by elevating
the penalty for the offense of cruelty to animals in the second degree from a
misdemeanor to a class C felony when the offense involves ten or more pet
animals in any one instance, to ensure that defendants who were convicted of
animal cruelty involving multiple pet animals served time in jail.  Conference
Committee Report No. 74.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §§711-1109 TO 711-1110</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it declined to
accept the Proposed Draft's treatment of the offense of cruelty to animals. 
Section 711-1109 as adopted clarifies the existing law relating to the offense
of &quot;cruelty to animals.&quot;  It makes it a crime to &quot;knowingly or
recklessly&quot; overdrive, overload, torture, torment, deprive of necessary
sustenance, cruelly beat, or needlessly mutilate or kill any living creature. 
The section prohibits the keeping, using, management, or receipt of money for
admission for fighting or baiting any &quot;bull, bear, dog, cock, or other
creature.&quot;  It also bars the carrying of any creature in a cruel or
inhumane manner, and bars any other act towards the furtherance of any act of
cruelty to animals.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The section provides that if a domestic animal is so severely
injured that there is no reasonable probability that its life or usefulness can
be saved, the animal may be immediately destroyed.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The section also states that the provisions do not apply to &quot;accepted
veterinary practices&quot; and &quot;scientific research&quot; activities.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section 711-1110 is a new section which was not contained in
the Proposed Draft.  It authorizes agents of any society for the prevention of
cruelty to animals to make arrests for violations of §711-1109.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Code basically retains the prior existing Hawaii law
relating to this subject.  Thus the provisions set forth in HRS chapter 722,
with updating, appear to be restated in substantial part in the Code.  The Code
treatment thus differs from the brief provision recommended by the Proposed
Draft.  The legislature felt that the provision was too vague to prevent some
types of mistreatment of animals.  Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 262, Session Laws 1985, requires the defendant convicted
of cruelty to animals to surrender:  (1) the animal whose abuse led to the
conviction; and (2) any other animal if there is evidence of its abuse or neglect. 
The Legislature felt that a court-ordered hiatus in the custody of the abused
animal would accomplish the clear intent of this measure to protect abused
animals from further harm.  House Standing Committee Report No. 421, Senate
Standing Committee Report No. 897.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 238, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to clarify
that animal care costs incurred for abused or neglected animals will be the
responsibility of the abuser.  These animals are often left in the custody of
humane societies while the court resolves the criminal case against the
abuser.  A case often takes months or years to be resolved, while the animals
are cared for at the humane society's expense.  Act 238 made it clear that it
is the abuser who is financially responsible for the care of the animals.

<p class=XNotes>  Act 114, Session Laws 2007, amended this section, among
others, by conforming the forfeiture provisions to apply to the felony
prohibitions of the Act.  Act 114 created the offense of cruelty to animals in
the first degree, making it a felony to intentionally or knowingly torture,
mutilate, or poison or cause the torture, mutilation, or poisoning of any pet
animal resulting in serious bodily injury or death of the pet animal.  The
legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must be not
tolerated in our society. Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse and the
commission of violent acts against humans.  Hawaii is only one of nine states
in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal abuse.  The
legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional bond and
relationship with their owners and family members and friends.  Violence and
harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional impact on their
owners and family.  The felony provisions of Act 114 protected pet animals.

<p class=XNotes>  Act 149, Session Laws 2011, amended this section by adding
cruelty to animals by fighting dogs to the offenses that may force forfeiture
of a dog.  The legislature found that dogfighting is a brutal practice which
often results in the death of the participating dogs within hours or days after
the fight.  Also, because dogs used for fighting have been bred for generations
to be dangerously aggressive toward other animals, the presence of the dogs in
a community increases the risk of attacks on not only other animals, but
potentially on children, whose small size may cause a fighting dog to perceive
a child as another animal.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 562, House
Standing Committee Report No. 1098.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 149, Session Laws 2011, also provided for the reenactment

<p class=XNotes>  Act 278, Session Laws 1999, added this section to make it a
felony to take sexual photographs or videotapes of a person without that
person's consent and when the person expects privacy.  The legislature found
that current laws criminalizing a violation of privacy do not distinguish
between surreptitious recording of any events and sounds in a private place,
and the more egregious offense of installing a hidden device to surreptitiously
record or observe persons while they are undressed or engaging in sexual
activity.  The legislature believed that using a hidden device to record
someone while engaged in very personal acts merits a higher penalty than simply
using a hidden device to record any events in a private place.  Senate Standing
Committee Report No. 1579, Conference Committee Report No. 87.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section to update the
crime of violation of privacy in the first degree to punish &quot;video
voyeurism&quot; in public places.  The legislature found that through
technological advancements, recording and broadcasting devices are easily
concealed.  Incidents of &quot;video voyeurism&quot; in public places have
occurred but are not chargeable under existing laws.   Changing the offense of
violation of privacy would address the growing concern for the offensive
practice of &quot;upskirt photography.&quot;  Senate Standing Committee Report
No. 637, House Standing Committee Report No. 1316.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 83, Session Laws 2004, amended this section to clarify
that the offense of violation of privacy in the first degree included the use
or installation, or both, in any private place and without the consent of the
person or persons entitled to privacy therein, of any device for observing,
recording, amplifying, or broadcasting another person in a stage of undress or
sexual activity in that place.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1174-04.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 116, Session Laws 2014, expanded the offense of violation
of privacy in the first degree to include knowingly disclosing an image or
video of another identifiable person either in the nude or engaging in sexual
conduct without the consent of the depicted person with intent to harm
substantially the depicted person.  Act 116 also provided immunity for:  (1)
the distribution of images or videos made of the depicted person while
voluntarily nude or voluntarily engaging in sexual conduct in public, or
pursuant to a voluntary commercial transaction; and (2) the providers of
electronic communication service or remote computing service for images or
videos disclosed through the service by another person.  The legislature found
that California legislation that was signed into law in 2013 prohibited a &quot;revenge
porn&quot; perpetrator from distributing sexually explicit pictures that were
intended to be private.  A number of other states have since considered similar
legislation.  Advancements in cellular and internet technology have made it
easy to disseminate and access intimate images, videos, and recordings that
depict an individual in the nude or engaged in sexual activity.  These images
and recordings can be used to retaliate against the depicted individual.  Act
116 addressed the concerns and ramifications of the dissemination of a
representation of nude person or, of a person engaging in sexual conduct
without the depicted person's consent by making the dissemination a criminal
offense.  Conference Committee Report No. 29-14, Senate Standing Committee Report

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1111</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section is provided on the theory that in an era of
increasing use of electronic eavesdropping devices, criminal sanctions should
be used to protect an individual's right of privacy.  Wiretapping is contrary
to federal law, but it is right that state law should also be on record against
it.  Therefore, in addition to simple trespassory, nonmechanical eavesdropping,
covered in subsection (1)(a), §711-1111 forbids any sort of electronic or
mechanical eavesdropping or surveillance whether done through some physical
connection with the place under surveillance or not.  Thus subsection (1)(b)
forbids installation or use of eavesdropping equipment in a &quot;private place&quot;
(defined in §711-1100) whereas subsection (1)(c) forbids the use anywhere of
equipment designed to receive sounds originating in a private place and
normally inaudible or incomprehensible outside.  Physical contact with the private
place is not necessary.  Subsection (1)(d) generally forbids wiretapping, but
does not apply to listening in on a party line or extension phone (these are
risks known to all telephone users and are not of the magnitude of a wiretap),
nor does it apply to interception by the telephone company or a subscriber
seeking to ascertain that the telephone is not being put to improper use.  Thus
a company with a telephone switchboard would not be guilty of a crime if it
ordered an employee to monitor calls in order to assure that instructions
limiting use of the telephone to business calls were being followed. 
Subsection (1)(e) forbids anyone to divulge the existence or contents of a
telephone call, telegram, or letter, which he knows was unlawfully intercepted,
or which he learned of in the course of his employment by a transmitting
agency, without the consent of the sender or the receiver.  Since subsection
(1)(d) has the exceptions noted, subsection (1)(e) would not cover the party
line eavesdropper who reveals what he has overheard.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law in this area was limited to violations of
privacy resulting from interception or recordation of telephone and wire
communications.[1]  The Code, therefore, is broader in its overall scope than
prior law.  However, as applied to telephone and wire interceptions or
recordations, the Code would limit criminal liability to situations where the
conduct was engaged in without the consent of both parties (sender and
receiver) to the conversation or communication.  If one of the parties to the
communication authorizes its interception or recordation (e.g., in an attempt
to trace obscene or extortionary telephone calls), criminal sanctions ought not
to result.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 278, Session Laws 1999, amended this section, more
specifically, by making the offense of violation of privacy in the second
degree a misdemeanor.  The offense does not include the installation of any
device for, among other things, videotaping or filming another person in a
state of undress or sexual activity, which is covered under §711-1110.9.  The
knowing possession of materials created under circumstances prohibited in

technological advancements, recording and broadcasting devices are easily
concealed.  Incidents of &quot;video voyeurism&quot; in public places have
occurred but are not chargeable under existing laws.   Changing the offense of
violation of privacy would address the growing concern for the offensive

<p class=XNotes>  Act 83, Session Laws 2004, amended this section to include
photographic images among the types of private communications that may not be
intercepted or divulged without the consent of the sender or receiver, except
when the images are disseminated, distributed, or transferred by electronic
communication service providers or remote storage services in the ordinary
course of business.  Act 83 also defined the terms &quot;electronic
communication,&quot; &quot;electronic communication service,&quot; &quot;electronic
communication service provider,&quot; &quot;electronic communication system,&quot;
and &quot;remote storage service&quot;.  Act 83 made statutory amendments to
the existing privacy law in order to prohibit the inappropriate use of new

<p class=XNotes>  Act 59, Session Laws 2012, amended this section to exclude
the surveillance of another in a stage of undress or sexual activity as such
acts are covered by violation of privacy in the first degree.  The legislature
found that existing law regarding a violation of privacy in the second degree,
a misdemeanor, as it pertains to a person in a stage of undress or sexual
activity was also covered by the felony offense of violation of privacy in the
first degree.  According to testimony submitted, case law required that a
violator be charged under the lesser charge in order to avoid constitutional
due process and equal protection issues.  Act 59 would resolve that conflict by
excluding the behavior from the lesser second degree offense, thereby allowing
violators to be charged under the felony offense.  House Standing Committee
