<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Board members shall serve staggered terms
and the interim board shall recommend an appropriate schedule for staggered

shall serve during their entire term of office or until the governor names a
replacement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Any changes to the board structure and
governance shall be in compliance with federal law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The board shall adopt policies prohibiting
conflicts of interest and procedures for recusal of a member in the case of an
actual or potential conflict of interest, including policies prohibiting a
member from taking part in official action on any matter in which the member
had any financial involvement or interest prior to the commencement of service
