<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §46-80.5  Special improvement district.</b> 
(a)  In addition and supplemental to the authority vested in the counties by
sections 46-80 and 46-80.1, any county having a charter may enact an ordinance,
and may amend the same from time to time, authorizing the creation of special
improvement districts for the purpose of providing and financing supplemental
maintenance and security services and such other improvements, services, and
facilities within the special improvement district as the council of the county
determines will restore or promote business activity in the special improvement
district and making and financing improvements therein.  Each separate special
improvement district shall be established by a separate ordinance enacted as
provided in the ordinance authorizing the creation of special improvement
districts.  The ordinance authorizing the creation of special improvement
districts may permit the county to provide for a board or association,
established pursuant to chapter 414D, to provide management of the special
improvement district, and to carry out activities as may be prescribed by the
ordinance authorizing the creation of special improvement districts and the
ordinance establishing the special improvement district as permitted thereby.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The county may levy and assess a special
assessment on property located within the special improvement district to
finance the maintenance and operation of the special improvement district and
to pay the debt service on any bonds issued to finance improvements within the
special improvement district.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, in
assessing property for a special assessment, the county may implement a
methodology as the council of the county deems appropriate.  The special
assessment may be fixed in an amount or appropriated on a basis as the council
of the county deems appropriate, and it shall not be essential that the
property subject to the special assessment be improved or benefitted by the
operation and maintenance of the special improvement district or any activity
or improvement undertaken for, and financed by, the special improvement
district.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The county may issue and sell bonds to
finance improvements within the special improvement district and the ordinance
authorizing the creation of special improvement districts may provide the
method, procedure, and type or types of security for those bonds.  Each issue
or series of bonds shall be authorized by ordinance separate from the ordinance
establishing the special improvement district.  The bonds shall be in amounts,
in denomination or denominations, in form or forms, executed in a manner,
payable in place or places and at time or times, bear interest at rate or rates
(either fixed or variable), mature on date or dates and provide terms and
conditions of redemption, provide security (including the pledge of proceeds of
the bonds, special assessments, and the lien therefor), provide for credit
enhancement, if any, administration, terms of investment of proceeds of the
bonds and special assessment receipts, provide terms of default and remedy, and
other terms and conditions, as the council of the county deems necessary or
proper.  The bonds may be sold in a manner and at price or prices as the
council of the county shall determine.  Bonds issued pursuant to this section
and the interest thereon and other income therefrom shall be exempt from any
and all taxation by the State or any county or other political subdivision,
except inheritance, transfer, and estate taxes.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Notwithstanding any other law to the
contrary, no action or proceeding to object to or question the validity of or
enjoining any ordinance, action, or proceeding permitted by this section
(including the liability for or the determination of the amount of any special
assessment levied or the imposition thereof), or any bonds issued or to be
issued pursuant to an ordinance enacted as permitted by this section, shall be
maintained unless begun within thirty days of the enactment of the ordinance,
determination, or other act, as the case may be and, in the case of the
assessment, whether the determination or levy, within thirty days after
adoption of the ordinance authorizing or amending the assessment formula and,
in the case of bonds, within thirty days after enactment of the ordinance
authorizing the issuance of the bonds.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Exemptions.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Property owned by the state or county governments
or entities, may be exempt from the assessment except as provided in paragraph
(3);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Property owned by the federal government or entities,
shall be exempt from the assessment except as provided in paragraph (3);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  If a public body owning property, including
property held in trust for any beneficiary, which is exempt from an assessment
pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2), grants a leasehold or other possessory
interest in the property to a nonexempt person or entity, the assessment,
notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), shall be levied on the leasehold or
possessory interest and shall be payable by the lessee;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The redevelopment of the Ala Wai boat harbor
shall be exempt from the assessment and any special improvement district
requirements authorized by subsection (a); and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  No other properties or owners shall be exempt
from the assessment unless the properties or owners are expressly exempted in
the ordinance establishing a district adopted pursuant to this section or
amending the rate or method of assessment of an existing district.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The assessments levied pursuant to the
ordinance authorizing the creation of special improvement districts, the
ordinance establishing a district, and this section shall be a lien upon the
property assessed.  The lien shall have priority over all other liens except
the lien of general real property taxes and shall be on a parity with the lien
of assessments levied under sections 46-80 and 46-80.1.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Any board or association established for
the purposes of carrying out the activities described in this section shall not
be deemed a governmental body.  The board and association shall neither be
deemed to be a government department, agency, or a county nor to be performing
services on behalf of a government department, agency, or county. [L 1999, c
107, §1; am L 2002, c 40, §2; am L 2011, c 197, §3]</p>
