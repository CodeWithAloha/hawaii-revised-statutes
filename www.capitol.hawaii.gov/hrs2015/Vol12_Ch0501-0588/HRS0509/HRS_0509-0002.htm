<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§509-2  Creation of joint tenancy, tenancy
by the entirety, and tenancy in common.</b>  (a)  Land, or any interest
therein, or any other type of property or property rights or interests or
interest therein, may be conveyed by a person to oneself and another or others
as joint tenants, or by a person to oneself and one's spouse or reciprocal
beneficiary, or by spouses to themselves, or by reciprocal beneficiaries to
themselves, as tenants by the entirety, or by joint tenants to themselves and
another or others as joint tenants, or tenants in common to themselves or to
themselves and another or others as joint tenants, or by tenants by the
entirety to themselves or themselves and another or others as joint tenants or
as tenants in common, or by one tenant by the entirety to the tenant's spouse
or reciprocal beneficiary of all of the tenant's interest or interests, without
the necessity of conveying through a third party, and each such instrument
shall be construed as validly creating a joint tenancy, tenancy by the
entirety, tenancy in common, or single ownership, as the case may be, if the
tenor of the instrument manifestly indicates such intention.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Conveyance of any real property located in
the State and held by spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries as tenants by the
entirety:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  To a joint trust as tenant in severalty for their
benefit and which is revocable and amendable by either or both during their
joint lifetime; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  In equal shares as tenants in common to their
respective separate trusts, each of which is revocable and amendable by the
respective grantor, or any accumulation of such conveyed property,</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>shall have the same immunity from the claims of
their separate creditors as would exist if the spouses or reciprocal
beneficiaries had continued to hold the real property or its proceeds as
tenants by the entirety.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Subsection (b) shall apply as long as:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The spouses remain married or reciprocal
beneficiaries remain in a registered reciprocal beneficiary relationship;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The real property continues to be held in the
trust as provided under subsection (b);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Both spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries remain
beneficiaries of the trust and no waiver as provided under subsection (g) has
occurred;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The first and last name of the spouse or reciprocal
beneficiary for their respective trusts, or the first and last names of both
spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries for a joint trust, are included in the name
of the trust; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Notice of the intention to continue to hold the
real property or its proceeds as tenants by the entirety is provided by a deed
of conveyance by the spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries and filed or recorded
in land court or the bureau of conveyances, or both, as appropriate; provided
that the notice shall specifically refer to this section and state that the
real property to be held by the trust shall be immune from the claims of their
separate creditors.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  After the death of the first of the
spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, all real property held in the trust that was
immune from the claims of their separate creditors under subsection (b)
immediately prior to the individual's death shall continue to have the same
immunity from the claims of the decedent's separate creditors as would have
existed if the spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries continued to hold the real
property conveyed in trust or its proceeds as tenants by the entirety.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In the event that any transfer of real
property held in tenancy by the entirety to a trustee of a trust as provided
under subsection (b) is held invalid by any court of proper jurisdiction, or if
the trust is revoked or dissolved by a court decree or operation of law, while
both spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries are living, then immediately upon the
occurrence of either event, all real property held in the trust shall
automatically be deemed to be held by both spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries
as tenants by the entirety.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Upon entry of a decree granting divorce or
annulment between the spouses or the termination of the reciprocal beneficiary
relationship, the immunity from the claims of separate creditors under
subsection (b) shall immediately terminate and the real property shall be
treated as held in tenancy in common.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The immunity from the claims of separate
creditors under subsections (b) and (d) may be waived as to any creditor or any
specifically described trust property by:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The express provisions of a trust instrument; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The written consent of both spouses or reciprocal
beneficiaries.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Except as provided otherwise herein, in
any dispute relating to the immunity of trust property from the claims of a
separate creditor of a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, the spouses or
reciprocal beneficiaries shall have the burden of proving the immunity of the trust
property from the creditor's claims.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  After a conveyance of real property to a
trust as provided under subsection (b), the real property transferred shall no
longer be held by the spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries as tenants by the
entirety and the disposition of the real property shall be controlled by the
terms of the trust.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  For the purposes of this chapter
&quot;reciprocal beneficiary&quot; means an adult who is a party to a
registered reciprocal beneficiary relationship in accordance with chapter 572C,
and has a valid certificate of reciprocal beneficiary relationship that has not
been terminated. [L 1941, c 167, §1; RL 1945, §12781; RL 1955, §345-2; am L
