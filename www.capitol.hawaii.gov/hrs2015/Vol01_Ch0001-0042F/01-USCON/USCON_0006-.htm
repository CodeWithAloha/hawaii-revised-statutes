<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     All Debts contracted and Engagements entered
into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the
United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     This Constitution, and the Laws of the United
States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or
which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the
supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges of every State shall be bound thereby,
any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
notwithstanding.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The Senators and Representatives before
mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive
and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States,
shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no
religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or
public Trust under the United States.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Attorney General Opinions</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Article 8, titled &quot;Nuclear Energy&quot;, of chapter 14
of Hawaii County Code and proposed amendment to the article, that would
prohibit the transportation into or storage of any radioactive material that
could be used, e.g., in an irradiation facility, were preempted by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954.  Att. Gen. Op. 99-1.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Allocating royalties from geothermal developments on
department of Hawaiian home lands (DHHL) lands to the board of land and natural
resources or the counties violated §4 of the Admission Act and article XII, §§1
and 3 of the Hawaii constitution.  It is clear from the Admission Act and the
Hawaii constitution that the State has an obligation to manage such resources
on Hawaiian home lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians pursuant to the
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA).  Allocation of royalties from geothermal
developments on DHHL lands to entities other than DHHL would be violations of
both the Admission Act and the Hawaii constitution because those proceeds would
not be available to DHHL to carry out the terms and conditions of the HHCA. 
Att. Gen. Op. 14-1.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Law Journals and Reviews</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Hawaiian Self-Determination:  A Need for Debate.  III HBJ No.
13, at pg. 121.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, Inc. v. City &amp; County of
Honolulu:  Demonstrating the Need to Abandon the Field Preemption Doctrine.  29
UH L. Rev. 501.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Supremacy.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  No implied preemption of state mooring and anchoring
regulations where congressional intent to preempt state action is not clearly
manifest, federal regulation has not occupied the field of navigation, and the
federal interest in navigation is not so dominant as to assume federal
preemption of state laws.  42 F.3d 1185.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  No preemption of state mooring and anchoring regulations by
Submerged Lands Act where there was no actual conflict between federal Act and
Hawaii's regulations.  42 F.3d 1185.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 243 [L 1995] preempted by Newspaper Preservation Act,
because Act 243 intruded upon a field preempted by Congress; plaintiffs'
preemption claim was ripe.  103 F.3d 742.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State regulation that prohibited commercial tour boat
operators from operating their tour boats in Hanalei Bay, in conjunction with
relevant federal shipping laws, violated the supremacy clause.  340 F.3d 1053.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Device implanted in plaintiff's leg had no requirements
imposed upon it by Medical Device Amendments to Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act or Food and Drug Administration which would preempt state tort
claims.  841 F. Supp. 327.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiffs filed motion for preliminary injunction
regarding Act 359 of 1993 Hawaii legislature (relating to Hawaiian
sovereignty), as amended in 1994 and 1996, no supremacy clause violation found
regarding native Hawaiian vote.  941 F. Supp. 1529.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Complaint did not allege conduct which would constitute state
tort exception to area of labor relations otherwise preempted by federal law. 
65 H. 189, 649 P.2d 1119; 73 H. 276, 831 P.2d 1335.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Implied warranty claim not preempted by Medical Device
Amendments to Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act.  74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Federal Aviation Act did not preempt state's power, under
§239-6, to tax gross receipts attributable to the ground transportation portion
of air packages that common carrier transported interisland and/or between
Hawaii and the mainland.  88 H. 336, 966 P.2d 648.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Public utilities commission correctly determined that it
could not assume jurisdiction over federal military camp and dismissed
complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as this Article preempted any
state regulation over the military camp; it was not shown that camp was not an
instrumentality of the United States and therefore not entitled to invoke
immunity or that the camp was an instrumentality of the United States, but
there was a clear and unambiguous congressional authorization waiving camp's
immunity from direct state regulation.  112 H. 150, 145 P.3d 693.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiffs' state law claims, alleging violation of chapter
480 and common law fraud, to the extent they were premised on Truth in Lending
Act (TILA) or Regulation Z violations, including defendant's alleged failure to
properly disclose certain terms in its documents as required by TILA, were
preempted; the remaining state law claims were not preempted.  647 F. Supp. 2d
1208 (2008).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The preemption provision of the federal National Traffic and
Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 did not preempt state law tort claim; no
conflict preemption between state tort law claim and federal department of
transportation standard.  696 F. Supp. 2d 1150 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Parts of plaintiff's unfair and deceptive trade practices
claim were not preempted by federal law where complaint alleged that defendant
had a general duty applicable to a contract, and not a duty created by a
federal statute or regulation.  707 F. Supp. 2d 1080 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  State law claims that involved a union's duty to fairly
represent plaintiff were likely preempted by federal law.  722 F. Supp. 2d 1181
(2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the trial court was not presented with conflicting
state and federal statutes because the National Labor Relations Act did not
apply to the city and county of Honolulu, the appeals court's application of
preemption principles to conclude that employee was not required to exhaust
employee's contractual remedies under the collective bargaining agreement was
erroneous.  121 H. 1, 210 P.3d 501 (2009).</p>
