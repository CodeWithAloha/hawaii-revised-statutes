<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Migratory Bird Treaty Act was upheld by Supreme Court under
Article I, Section 8 necessary and proper clause and Article II treaty-making
power.  103 F.3d 1475.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Section 1.  The executive Power shall be vested
in a President of the United States of America.  He shall hold his Office
during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen
for the same Term, be elected as follows</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the
Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number
of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the
Congress:  but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of
Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     [The Electors shall meet in their respective
States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be
an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves.  And they shall make a List of
all the Persons voted for, and the Number of Votes for each; which List they
shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of
the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.  The President of
the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives,
open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted.  The Person
having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a
Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than
one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House
of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President;
and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the
said House shall in like Manner chuse the President.  But in chusing the
President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each
State having one vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or
Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall
be necessary to a Choice.  In every Case, after the Choice of the President,
the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the
Vice President.  But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes,
the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President].*</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The Congress may determine the Time of chusing
the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall
be the same throughout the United States.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,
shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be
eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years,
and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     In Case of the Removal of the President from
Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and
Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and
the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or
Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer
shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the
Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.**</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The President shall, at stated Times, receive
for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor
diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall
not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or
any of them.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Before he enter on the Execution of his Office,
he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:-- I do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the
United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States.</p>
