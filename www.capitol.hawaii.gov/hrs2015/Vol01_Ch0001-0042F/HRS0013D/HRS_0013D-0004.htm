Beginning January 1, 2014, members of the board of trustees shall be nominated
at a primary election and elected at the general election in every
even-numbered year.  Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, members
shall be nominated and elected in the manner prescribed by this title.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The chief election officer shall prepare
the nomination papers in such a manner that a candidate desiring to file for
election to the board shall be able to specify whether the candidate is seeking
a seat requiring residency on a particular island or a seat without a residency
requirement.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The board of trustees ballot shall be
prepared in such a manner that every voter qualified and registered under
section 13D-3 shall be afforded the opportunity to vote for each and every
candidate seeking election to the board.  The ballot shall contain the names of
all board candidates arranged in accordance with section 11-115.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Each voter registered to vote in the
general election shall be entitled to receive the office of Hawaiian affairs
ballot and to vote for the number of seats available on the respective islands.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Any election with only one available seat
without a residency requirement or for any available seat requiring residency
on a particular island shall be conducted as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  If, after the close of filing of nomination
papers, there is only one qualified candidate for any available seat, the chief
election officer shall declare the candidate to be duly and legally elected,
and the name of that candidate shall not appear on the primary or the general
election ballot;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  If, after the close of filing nomination papers,
there are only two qualified candidates for any available seat, the chief
election officer shall declare those two candidates duly nominated for the
general election.  The names of those two candidates shall not appear on the
primary election ballot; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  If, at the close of filing of nomination papers,
there are three or more qualified candidates for any available seat, the names
of those candidates shall be listed on the primary election ballot.  The two
candidates receiving the highest number of votes for each available seat shall
be nominated at the primary election for the general election; provided that if
any candidate receives more than fifty per cent of the total votes cast for the
available seat at the primary election, the chief election officer shall
declare that candidate to be duly and legally elected and the name of that candidate
shall not appear on the general election ballot.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Any election with three available seats
without a residency requirement shall be conducted as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  If, after the close of filing of nomination
papers, there are only three or less qualified candidates for the available
seats without a residency requirement, the chief election officer shall declare
those candidates to be duly and legally elected and the names of those
candidates shall not appear on the primary or general election ballot;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  If, after the close of filing of nomination
papers, there are four, five, or six qualified candidates for the available
seats without a residency requirement, the chief election officer shall declare
those candidates duly nominated for the general election.  The names of those
candidates shall not appear on the primary election ballot; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  If, at the close of filing of nomination papers,
there are seven or more qualified candidates for the available seats without a
residency requirement, the names of those candidates shall be listed on the primary
election ballot.  The qualified candidates receiving the highest number of
total votes at the primary election shall be declared by the chief election
officer duly nominated for the general election provided that the general
election shall include no more than twice the number of qualified candidates as
seats available; provided further that if any candidate receives more than
fifty per cent of the total votes cast for the available seats at the primary
election, the chief election officer shall declare that candidate to be duly
and legally elected and the name of that candidate shall not appear on the
general election ballot. [L 1979, c 196, pt of §8; gen ch 1985; am L 2013, c
