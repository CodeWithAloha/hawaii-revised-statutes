<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §220.  Development projects; appropriations
by legislature; bonds issued by legislature; mandatory reservation of water.</b> 
(a)  Subject to subsection (d), the department is authorized directly to
undertake and carry on general water and other development projects in respect
to Hawaiian home lands and to undertake other activities having to do with the
economic and social welfare of the homesteaders, including the authority to
derive revenue from the sale, to others than homesteaders, of water and other
products of such projects or activities, or from the enjoyment thereof by
others than homesteaders, where such sale of products or enjoyment of projects
or activities by others does not interfere with the proper performance of the
duties of the department; provided that roads through or over Hawaiian home
lands, other than federal-aid highways and roads, shall be maintained by the
county in which the particular road or roads to be maintained are located.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The legislature is authorized to
appropriate out of the treasury of the State such sums as it deems necessary to
augment the funds of the department and to provide the department with funds
sufficient to execute and carry on such projects and activities.  The
legislature is further authorized to issue bonds to the extent required to
yield the amount of any sums so appropriated for the payment of which, if
issued for revenue-producing improvements, the department shall provide, as set
forth in section 213.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  To enable the construction of irrigation
projects which will service Hawaiian home lands, either exclusively or in
conjunction with other lands served by such projects, the department is
authorized, with the approval of the governor, and subject to subsection (d),
to:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Grant to the board of land and natural resources,
or to any other agency of the government of the State or the United States
undertaking the construction and operation of such irrigation projects,
licenses for rights-of-way for pipelines, tunnels, ditches, flumes, and other
water conveying facilities, reservoirs, and other storage facilities, and for
the development and use of water appurtenant to Hawaiian home lands;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Exchange available lands for public lands, as
provided in section 204 of this Act, for sites for reservoirs and subsurface
water development wells and shafts;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Request any such irrigation agency to organize
irrigation projects for Hawaiian home lands and to transfer irrigation
facilities constructed by the department to any such irrigation agency;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Agree to pay the tolls and assessments made
against community pastures for irrigation water supplied to such pastures; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Agree to pay the costs of construction of
projects constructed for Hawaiian home lands at the request of the department,
in the event the assessments paid by the homesteaders upon lands are not
sufficient to pay such costs;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that licenses for rights-of-way for the
purposes and in the manner specified in this section may be granted for a term
of years longer than is required for amortization of the costs of the project
or projects requiring use of such rights-of-way only if authority for such
longer grant is approved by an act of the legislature of the State.  Such
payments shall be made from, and be a charge against the Hawaiian home operating
fund.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For projects pursuant to this section,
sufficient water shall be reserved for current and foreseeable domestic, stock
water, aquaculture, and irrigation activities on tracts leased to native
Hawaiians pursuant to section 207(a). [Am Jul.&nbsp;10, 1937, c 482, 50 Stat
507; Nov.&nbsp;26, 1941, c 544, §6, 55 Stat 786; Jun.&nbsp;14, 1948, c 464, §7,

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Pursuant to article XI, §§1 and 7 of the Hawaii constitution,
subsection (d) of this Act, and §174C-101(a), a reservation of water
constitutes a public trust purpose.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where commission on water resource management failed to
render the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to
whether applicant had satisfied its burden as mandated by the state water code,
it violated its public trust duty to protect the department of Hawaiian home
lands' reservation rights under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the state
water code, the state constitution, and the public trust doctrine in balancing
the various competing interests in the state water resources trust.  103 H.
401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where commission on water resource management refused to
permit cross examination of water use applicant's oceanography expert regarding
the limu population along the shoreline, in effect precluding the commission
from effectively balancing the applicant's proposed private commercial use of
water against an enumerated public trust purpose, the commission failed
adequately to discharge its public trust duty to protect native Hawaiians'
traditional and customary gathering rights, as guaranteed by this section,
article XII, §7 of the Hawaii constitution, and §174C-101.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d
664.</p>
