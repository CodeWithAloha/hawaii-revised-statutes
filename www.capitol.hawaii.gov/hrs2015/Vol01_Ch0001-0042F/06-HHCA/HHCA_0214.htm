available lands for purposes permitted by this Act; provided that any loan
agreement entered into under this paragraph by the department shall include a
provision that the money borrowed by the department is not secured directly or
indirectly by the full faith and credit or the general credit of the State or
by any revenues or taxes of the State other than the receivables specifically
pledged to repay the loan; provided further that in making loans or developing
available lands out of money borrowed under this paragraph, the department may
