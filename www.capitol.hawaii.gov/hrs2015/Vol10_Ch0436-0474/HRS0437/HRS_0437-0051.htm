<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§437-51]  Dispute resolution.</b>  (a)  In any
dispute among a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer on matters governed by this
part, the manufacturer, distributor, or dealer may seek a hearing from the department
of commerce and consumer affairs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The office of administrative hearings of the
department of commerce and consumer affairs shall accept no more than thirty requests
for hearing per fiscal year under this section.  The office of administrative hearings
may reject a request for a hearing if in the opinion of the hearings officer the
matter presented does not involve the interpretation or enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter.  The director of commerce and consumer affairs shall appoint a
hearings officer pursuant to section 26-9(f) who shall have jurisdiction to review
any request for hearing filed under this section.  The hearings officer shall have
the power to issue subpoenas, administer oaths, hear testimony, find facts, make
conclusions of law, and issue written decisions that shall be final and conclusive,
unless a party adversely affected by the decision files an appeal in the circuit
court under section 91-14.  All information so provided in and for the hearing shall
be sealed and not subject to public review or access.  The information shall also
remain confidential and not subject to public access or review on appeal pursuant
to section 91-14.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The party requesting the hearing shall file
a petition with the department of commerce and consumer affairs specifying the specific
provisions of this chapter that are in issue; the interpretation or enforcement
sought; the legal and factual basis for the interpretation or enforcement sought;
and the remedy or remedies sought.  The party requesting a hearing under this
section shall provide a copy of the petition to the board at the time the
petition is filed.  Each adverse party shall file a response with the department
of commerce and consumer affairs.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Hearings under this section shall be conducted
pursuant to chapter 91 and rules adopted by the department of commerce and consumer
affairs.  The burden of proof, including the burden of producing the evidence and
the burden of persuasion, shall be upon the party initiating the proceeding, unless
otherwise specified in this chapter.  The standard of proof required shall be
by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The hearings officer shall issue written findings
of fact, conclusions of law, and an order as expeditiously as practicable after
the hearing has been concluded.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  The prevailing party in any proceeding
brought under this section shall provide a copy of the hearings officer's
written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order to the board within ten
days of receipt of the written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Each party to the hearing shall bear the party's
own costs, including attorney's fees.  Both parties shall share equally in the cost
of the hearing, including any allocable departmental overhead attributable to the
hearing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Any party to a proceeding brought under this
section who is aggrieved by a final decision of a hearings officer may apply for
judicial review of that decision pursuant to section 91-14; provided that any party
seeking judicial review pursuant to section 91-14 shall be responsible for the costs
of preparing the record on appeal, including the cost of preparing the transcript
of the hearing.  Any party aggrieved by a final decision of a hearings officer
who applies for judicial review under this section shall provide a copy of the
party's application for judicial review to the board within ten days of filing
the application for judicial review.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  The department of commerce and consumer
affairs may adopt rules, pursuant to chapter 91, to effectuate the purpose of this
section and to implement its provisions, including fees to recover the cost of hearings.
