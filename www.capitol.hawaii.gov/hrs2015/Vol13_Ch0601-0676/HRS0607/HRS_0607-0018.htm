<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§607-18  Compensation of trustees.</b>  <i>[Section
effective January 1, 2015.  For section effective until December 31, 2014, see
below.]  </i>(a)  Unless the trust instrument otherwise provides, or the
settlor and trustee otherwise agree, or, after the settlor's death, all the
beneficiaries and the trustee otherwise agree, the trustee shall be entitled to
the compensation set forth in this section and the compensation shall be deemed
to be reasonable.  For good cause shown, the court may also approve any other
fee arrangement that it deems reasonable.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Banks and trust companies serving as
trustees shall be entitled to reasonable compensation, which may be set forth
in their published fee schedules and may be amended from time to time; provided
that advance written notice of any amendment to the fee schedule is provided to
the settlor or, after the settlor's death, to all beneficiaries.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Except as provided in subsection (a),
individuals serving as trustees shall be entitled to the following
compensation:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Compensation Upon Inception of the Trust:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  One per cent based upon the gross fair
market value of the trust assets on the date of the trustee's acceptance shall
be payable to the first trustee who is not the settlor of the trust; and </p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  One per cent based upon the gross fair
market value of the trust assets of the trust created under the revocable
living or administrative trust on the date of the trustee's acceptance shall be
payable to the first trustee of any trust created under a revocable living
trust after the settlor's death or other administrative trust; provided that
the trustee shall not also be the trustee of the revocable living trust or
administrative trust that is the source of funding for the newly-created trust;
</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>          provided that if more than one individual serves
as trustee, then the compensation shall be divided equally between the
then-acting trustees unless otherwise agreed by the trustees.  If one or more
individuals are serving as co-trustees with a bank or trust company, then the
individual trustees shall be entitled to fifty per cent of the compensation
provided for under this paragraph described herein, which shall be divided
among the then-serving individual co-trustees as they may agree.  A bank or
trust company serving as co-trustee shall be entitled to the compensation
described in subsection (b).</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Annual Compensation:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Upon all moneys and other property
received in the nature of revenue or income of the trust, such as rents,
interest, dividends, and general profits, five per cent of the income received
during each year shall be payable to the trustee, as and when the income is
received;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Upon the principal trust, the trustee
shall be compensated no more than once per quarter, based on the following:</p>

<p class=iClause>              (i)  One-half of one per cent of the first
$5,000,000;</p>

<p class=iClause>             (ii)  One-third of one per cent of the next
$3,000,000;</p>

<p class=iClause>            (iii)  One-fifth of one per cent of the next
$2,000,000; and</p>

<p class=iClause>             (iv)  One-tenth of one per cent of assets in
excess of $10,000,000,</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>              based upon the gross fair market value of
the principal assets as of the first business day of the trust's fiscal year;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B),
a trustee shall be entitled to a minimum total annual compensation of $3,000;
and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  The threshold dollar amounts in
subparagraph (B) and the dollar amounts in subparagraph (C) shall be increased
by an amount equal to (i) the dollar amount from subparagraph (B) or (C), as
applicable, multiplied by (ii) a cost-of-living adjustment with changes in the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) using the year 2014 as the base.&nbsp; The
&quot;CPI&quot; means the Consumer Price Index (Annual Average) for All Urban
Consumers (CPI-U); for the Honolulu area - All Items, reported by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor or its successor or, if the
index is discontinued, an equivalent index reported by a federal
authority.&nbsp; If no such index is reported, the term means the substitute
index chosen by a court of competent jurisdiction.  If any amount as adjusted is
not a multiple of $10,000, such amount shall be rounded down to the next lowest
multiple of $10,000;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Compensation Upon Termination of the Trust:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>          One per cent based upon the gross fair market
value of the trust assets as of the termination date of the trust pursuant to
the terms of the trust, shall be payable to the trustee at any time after the
termination date, up to and including the date the trust assets are finally
distributed; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Special Service Fees:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>          Further compensation may be made as the court
deems just and reasonable for services performed in connection with assuming
the trusteeship, sales or leases of real estate, contested or litigated claims
against the estate, the adjustment and payment of extensive or complicated
estate or inheritance taxes, the preparation of estate and income tax returns,
the carrying on of the decedent's business pursuant to an order of court or
under the provisions of any will, litigation in regard to the property of the
estate, and such other special services as may be necessary for the trustee to
perform, prosecute, or defend; provided that if all of the beneficiaries agree
to the trustee's special service fees, then court approval shall not be
required.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For purposes of any agreement between the
trustee and the beneficiaries regarding the trustee's compensation, the
agreement shall be binding upon incapacitated, minor, unborn, and unascertained
beneficiaries if the applicable provisions of section 560:1-403(2)(B) and (C)
are satisfied.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The following terms, or comparable
language in the provisions of a trust, unless otherwise limited or modified,
authorize compensation to the trustee under this section:  &quot;reasonable
compensation&quot;, &quot;compensation in accordance with applicable law&quot;,
&quot;compensation&quot;, &quot;reasonable compensation commensurate with the
services performed&quot;, and &quot;statutory compensation&quot;.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  This section shall apply to future
accounting in existing trusts as well as to new trusts.  This section shall not
apply to charitable trusts. [RL 1935, pt of §3793; am L 1935, c 124, §1; am L
