<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Bidder's submission of two bids in a sealed competitive
bidding process that permitted submission of only one bid was a material
deviation from the bid solicitation special conditions and nonresponsive; bid
thus properly rejected.  89 H. 443, 974 P.2d 1033.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where contractor was required to use a licensed plumbing
subcontractor for the project and it was undisputed that contractor did not name
in its bid a person or firm to be engaged by it as a plumbing subcontractor for
the project, contractor's bid was nonresponsive.  101 H. 68 (App.), 62 P.3d
631.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the record amply indicated that contractor had the
capability &quot;in all respects to perform fully the contract requirements,
and the integrity and reliability which will assure good faith
performance&quot;, it was therefore a &quot;responsible bidder&quot; within the
meaning of §103D-302(h) and this section.  101 H. 68 (App.), 62 P.3d 631.</p>
