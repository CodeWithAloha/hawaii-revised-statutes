<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Needs assessment study&quot; means a
study required under an impact fee ordinance that determines the need for a

received by a development from a public facility capital improvement that is
greater than the benefit afforded the general public in the jurisdiction
imposing the impact fees.  Incidental benefit to other developments shall not
negate a &quot;reasonable&quot; benefit to a development.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Recoupment&quot; means the proportionate
share of the public facility capital improvement costs of excess capacity in
existing capital facilities where excess capacity has been provided in
