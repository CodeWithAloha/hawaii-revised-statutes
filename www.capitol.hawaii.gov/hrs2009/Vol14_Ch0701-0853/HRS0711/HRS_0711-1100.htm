<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1100</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section is definitional only and, of course, specifies
no offense.  A discussion of the definitions in this section, when needed or
appropriate, is found in the commentary to the substantive offenses employing
the terms defined.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §711-1100</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Code as adopted added Items (5) and (6).  The Proposed
Draft did not contain these items.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 192, Session Laws 1986, amended the definition of
&quot;animal&quot; to exclude human beings, thereby foreclosing the possible
interpretation of the statute to include within the offense persons engaged in
boxing.  House Conference Committee Report No. 37-86, Senate Conference
Committee Report No. 27-86, and House Standing Committee Report No. 392.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 292, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;facsimile&quot; to strengthen the laws against
harassment.  Conference Committee Report No. 57.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended this section by adding
the definitions of &quot;pet animal&quot; and &quot;necessary
sustenance&quot;.  Act 173 protected pet animals in Hawaii from neglect by
defining minimum standards of care.  The legislature found that pet animals
deserved at least the minimum care of food, water, and protection from the
elements.  Act 173 established guidelines to be used to prevent the neglect and
abuse of pet animals.  Conference Committee Report No. 87.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by adding the
definition of &quot;record&quot;.  The legislature found that advancement in
technology has provided opportunity for &quot;video voyeurism&quot; in public
places.  A change in the offense of violation of privacy would address the
growing concern for the offensive practice of &quot;upskirt photography&quot;. 
House Standing Committee Report No. 1316.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 83, Session Laws 2004, amended the definition of
&quot;record&quot; to include digital recordings within the purview of privacy
offenses.  Act 83 made statutory amendments to the existing privacy law in
order to prohibit the inappropriate use of new digital technologies, such as cellular
phones, that are capable of taking digital photographs and transmitting those
images.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1174-04, Conference Committee
Report No. 43-04.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 114, Session Laws 2007, amended this section by, among
other things, defining &quot;pet animal&quot; as a dog, cat, domesticated
rabbit, guinea pig, [domesticated pig,] or caged birds, so long as they are not
bred for consumption.  Act 114 strengthened Hawaii's animal cruelty laws.  The
legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must be not
tolerated in our society. Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse and the
commission of violent acts against humans.  Hawaii is only one of nine states
in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal abuse.  The
legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional bond and
relationship with their owners and family members and friends.  Violence and
harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional impact on their
owners and family.  The felony provisions of Act 114 protected pet animals. 
Conference Committee Report No. 29.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 111, Session Laws 2008, amended this section by adding
the definition of &quot;equine animal&quot;.  Act 111 extended to equine
animals some of the legal protections accorded to pet animals relating to
animal cruelty by making an offense involving serious bodily injury or death to
an equine animal a class C felony.  The legislature believed that horses belong
under the protection of law and that adding equine animals to the list of
animals protected under the animal cruelty law reflects the fact that companion
animals come in all shapes and sizes.  House Standing Committee Report No.
1589-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2879, Conference Committee Report
No. 20-08.</p>
