<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>PART 2. 
GENERAL DEFINITIONS AND</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>PRINCIPLES
OF INTERPRETATION</b></p>

Unless the context otherwise requires, words or phrases defined in this
section, or in the additional definitions contained in other articles of this
chapter that apply to particular articles or parts thereof, have the meanings
stated.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Subject to definitions contained in other
articles of this chapter that apply to particular articles or parts thereof:</p>

their language or inferred from other circumstances, including course of
performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade as provided in section
490:1-303.</p>

business&quot; means a person that buys goods in good faith, without knowledge
that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods, and in the

selling goods of that kind.  A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the
sale to the person comports with the usual or customary practices in the kind
of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller's own usual or
customary practices.  A person that sells oil, gas, or other minerals at the
