or if the instruction is by an agent, the agent has actual authority to act on
behalf of the appropriate person;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The security is valid;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  There is no adverse claim to the security; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  At the time the instruction is presented to the

delivering a certificated security to a purchaser, the identity of the
principal was known to the person to whom the certificate was delivered, and
the certificate delivered by the agent was received by the agent from the
principal or received by the agent from another person at the direction of the
principal, the person delivering the security certificate warrants only that
the delivering person has authority to act for the principal and does not know
of any adverse claim to the certificated security.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  A secured party who redelivers a security

warranties provided in subsection (a) or (b), and has the rights and privileges
of a purchaser under this section.  The warranties of and in favor of the
broker acting as an agent are in addition to applicable warranties given by and
in favor of the customer. [L 1997, c 33, pt of §2]</p>
