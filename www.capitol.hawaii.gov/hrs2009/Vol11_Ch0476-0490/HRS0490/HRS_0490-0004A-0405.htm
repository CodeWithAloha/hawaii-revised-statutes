<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§490:4A-405  Payment by beneficiary's bank
to beneficiary.</b>  (a)  If the beneficiary's bank credits an account of the
beneficiary of a payment order, payment of the bank's obligation under section
490:4A-404(a) occurs when and to the extent (i) the beneficiary is notified of
the right to withdraw the credit, (ii) the bank lawfully applies the credit to
a debt of the beneficiary, or (iii) funds with respect to the order are
otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If the beneficiary's bank does not credit
an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, the time when payment of the
bank's obligation under section 490:4A-404(a) occurs is governed by principles
of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Except as stated in subsections (d) and
(e), if the beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary of a payment order under a
condition to payment or agreement of the beneficiary giving the bank the right
to recover payment from the beneficiary if the bank does not receive payment of
the order, the condition to payment or agreement is not enforceable.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  A funds-transfer system rule may provide
that payments made to beneficiaries of funds transfers made through the system
are provisional until receipt of payment by the beneficiary's bank of the
payment order it accepted.  A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is
provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if (i)
the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice
of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is
initiated, (ii) the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank, and the originator's
bank agreed to be bound by the rule, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank did not
receive payment of the payment order that it accepted.  If the beneficiary is
obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment
order by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator
of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under section 490:4A-406.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  This subsection applies to a funds
transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system
that (i) nets obligations multilaterally among participants, and (ii) has in
effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing
funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of one or more
participants that do not meet their settlement obligations.  If the
beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system
fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment
order in the funds transfer, (i) the acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is
nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance,
(ii) the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the
beneficiary, (iii) no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under
section 490:4A-406, and (iv) subject to section 490:4A-402(e), each sender in
the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order
under section 490:4A-402(c) because the funds transfer has not been completed.
