property that the person executing the declaration may deem desirable to set

or merger provisions shall require the vote or written consent of only the
declarant or such percentage of apartment owners as is provided in the
declaration; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (13)  A declaration subject to the penalties set forth
in section 514A-49(b) that the condominium property regime is in compliance
