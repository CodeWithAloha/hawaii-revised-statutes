<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§587-53  Temporary foster custody hearing.</b> 
(a)  If the department has continued to assume temporary foster custody of a
child pursuant to section 587-24(e)(3), the court shall set a temporary foster
custody hearing within two working days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and
holidays, after the filing of a petition to determine whether the best
interests of the child require further protection prior to an adjudicatory
determination.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  After reviewing a petition and the report
or reports submitted pursuant to section 587-40, the court, on its own motion,
may order that the child immediately be released from temporary foster custody
and returned to the child's family home under the terms and conditions,
including, but not limited to, orders which may be entered pursuant to
subsection (d), as are deemed by the court to be in the best interests of the
child; provided that upon the return the child and the child's family members
who are parties shall be under the temporary family supervision of the
department prior to the temporary foster custody hearing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The temporary foster custody hearing shall
be continued for a period not to exceed fifteen days, if the court determines
that it would be in the best interests of the child that further investigation
be conducted and information concerning whether the child should remain in
temporary foster custody be provided to the court by each of the parties, prior
to rendering a determination as to whether the child should remain in temporary
foster custody prior to an adjudication determination.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  During a continuance period ordered
pursuant to subsection (c) or at any other time during the pendency of a child
protective proceeding, the court may further order that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Any party undergo a physical, developmental,
psychological, or psychiatric evaluation and that a written or oral report be
submitted to the court and all parties prior to or upon the date of the
continued or next hearing;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The child's family members who are parties
provide the department or other appropriate authorized agency with the names
and addresses of other relatives and friends who may be potential visitation
supervisors or foster parents for the child and that they arrange for the
persons to appear in court upon the date of the continued or next hearing;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The child's family members who are parties be
permitted reasonable supervised or unsupervised visitation with the child at
the discretion of the department or other appropriate authorized agency and the
child's guardian ad litem;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The parties, subject to their agreement unless
jurisdiction has been established, meet with appropriate expert witnesses to
discuss the alleged harm to the child;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The court and the parties view a visual recording
or listen to an oral recording of the child's statement at such time and in
such manner as the court deems to be appropriate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  The child and the child's family members who are
parties, subject to their agreement unless jurisdiction has been established,
arrange and commence participation in such counseling or therapy for themselves
and the child as the court deems to be appropriate and consistent with the best
interests of the child;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  An appropriate order of protection be entered;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  A criminal history record check be conducted by the
department or other appropriate authorized agency concerning a party who is an
alleged perpetrator of imminent harm, harm, or threatened harm to the child,
and that the results be submitted to the court and other parties in such manner
as the court deems to be appropriate prior to or upon the date of the continued
or next hearing;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  The department or other appropriate authorized
agency prepare a written or oral supplemental report pursuant to section 587-40
and submit the report to the court, the guardian ad litem, and all parties
prior to or upon the date of the continued or next hearing; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  The child's guardian ad litem visit the child's
family home and foster home, be present during a supervised visitation, and
prepare a written or oral report, including specific recommendations concerning
services and assistance, to be submitted to the court and all parties prior to
or upon the date of the continued or next hearing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The court shall consider all relevant
prior and current information pertaining to the safe family home guidelines, as
set forth in section 587-25 and the report or reports submitted pursuant to
section 587-40, prior to rendering a determination in the temporary foster
custody hearing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  After a temporary foster custody hearing,
if the court determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that
continued placement in foster care is necessary to protect the child from
imminent harm, it shall order that the child continue in the temporary foster
custody of the department under the terms and conditions, including, but not
limited to, orders concerning services and assistance and which may be entered
pursuant to subsection (d), as are deemed by the court to be in the best
interests of the child; provided that prior to ordering placement or continued
placement in any proceeding under this chapter the court first shall give due
consideration to whether:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The removal or continued removal of the alleged
potential perpetrator of the imminent harm, harm, or threatened harm from the
child's family home prior to continuing or placing the child out of the family
home.  The child's family shall have the burden of establishing that it is not
in the best interests of the child that the alleged perpetrator be removed from
the family's home rather than the child by order of the court; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Every reasonable effort has been or is being made
to place siblings or psychologically bonded children together, unless the
placement is not in the best interests of the children.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  After a temporary foster custody hearing,
if the court determines that continued placement in foster care is not
necessary to protect the child from imminent harm, it may order that the child
immediately be released from temporary foster custody and returned to the child's
family home with the assistance of services and under the other terms and
conditions, including but not limited to, orders which may be entered pursuant
to subsection (d), as are deemed by the court to be in the best interests of
the child pending an adjudication or disposition hearing; provided that upon
the return, the child and the child's family members who are parties shall be
under the temporary family supervision of the department prior to an
adjudication or dispositional determination.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Any party may move for, or the court on
its own motion may order, a temporary foster custody hearing or rehearing at
any time after the petition is filed under this chapter in order to determine
whether the best interests of the child require that the child be placed in
temporary foster custody prior to an adjudication or dispositional
determination. [L 1983, c 171, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 316, §24; am L 1992, c
