<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Lease, lend, or otherwise furnish, on such terms
and conditions as the governor may consider necessary to promote the public

of the armed forces, or to the civil defense agency of the United States;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  On behalf of the State enter into mutual aid

behalf of the State that:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  Each party state shall extend to the civil
defense forces of any other party state, while operating within its state
limits under the terms and conditions of the compact, the same powers (except
that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties,
rights, privileges, and immunities as if they were performing their duties in
the state in which normally employed or rendering services;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Whenever any person holds a license,
certificate, or other permit issued by any state evidencing the meeting of

render aid involving this skill in any party state to meet an emergency or
disaster and the state shall give due recognition to such license, certificate,
or other permit as if issued in the state in which aid is rendered;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  No party state or its officers or

liable on account of any act or omission on the part of the forces while so
engaged, or on account of the maintenance or use of any materials, equipment,
goods, or facilities in connection therewith;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (D)  As an alternative to paragraph (C), such
other or modified form of immunity as the governor may find acceptable;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (E)  Each party state shall provide for the
payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the civil
defense forces of that state and the representatives of deceased members of the

pursuant to the compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the
injury or death were sustained within the state;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (F)  Any party state rendering aid in another
state pursuant to the compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving
aid, or by the United States government under plans approved by it, for any
loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment
answering a request for aid, and for all costs incurred in connection with
requests for aid; provided that this paragraph shall not be deemed to preclude
the State, if it is the aiding state, from assuming in whole or in part the
loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or from loaning the equipment or donating
the services to the receiving party state without charge or cost;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (G)  Any party state receiving evacuees shall
be reimbursed generally for the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving
and caring for the evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food,
clothing, medicines, and medical care, and like items; the expenditures shall
be reimbursed by the party state of which the evacuees are residents, or by the
United States government under plans approved by it; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (H)  In the event of an evacuation, the party
state of which the evacuees are residents shall, after the termination of the
emergency or disaster, assume the responsibility for the ultimate support or
repatriation of the evacuees;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Sponsor and develop mutual aid plans and agreements
for civil defense between the political subdivisions of the State and between
one or more political subdivisions and other public or private agencies, for
the furnishing or exchange of food, clothing, medicine, and other materials;

related services; fire fighting, rescue, transportation, and construction
services and facilities; personnel necessary to provide or conduct these

conditions as are deemed necessary;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Order and direct government agencies, officers,

law enforcement, medical, health, fire fighting, traffic control, warnings, and
signals, engineering, rescue, construction, emergency housing, and other welfare,
hospitalization, transportation, water supply, public information, training,
and other civil defense and emergency functions as may be necessary, and
utilize the services, materials, and facilities of the agencies and officers. 
All such agencies and officers shall cooperate with and extend their services,
materials, and facilities to the governor as the governor may request;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Take possession of, use, manage, control, and
reallocate any public property, state or county, real or personal, required by
the governor for the purposes of this chapter, including, without limitation,
airports, parks, playgrounds, and schools, and other public buildings. 
Whenever the property is so taken the governor shall have power to make such
provision for the temporary accommodation of the government service affected
thereby as the governor may deem advisable.  Like provisions may be made at any
time whenever it is necessary to relocate any government service because of any
emergency condition;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Utilize all services, materials, and facilities
of nongovernmental agencies, relief organizations, community associations, and
other civil groups and private agencies that may be made available;</p>

purposes provided for by this chapter; establish funds in the treasury for the
deposit and expenditure of the moneys; procure federal aid as the same may be
available, and apply the provisions of chapter 29 in cases of federal aid even
though not in the form of money.  The contributions or grants are appropriated
for the purposes of this chapter, or for the special purposes;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  Provide for the repair and maintenance of public
property, whenever adequate provision therefor is not otherwise made; insure
the property against any war risk, including without limitation damage or loss
resulting from or arising out of an attack or action in resisting or combating
an attack or apparent attack; provide for the restoration, renovation,
replacement, or reconstruction of insured property in the event of damage or
loss, and make temporary restoration of public utilities and other vital facilities
in the event of an attack or other disaster;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  Purchase, make, produce, construct, rent, lease,
or procure by condemnation or otherwise, transport, store, install, maintain,
and insure, repair, renovate, restore, replace, or reconstruct, and distribute,
furnish, or otherwise dispose of, with or without charges therefor, materials
and facilities for civil defense and other emergency functions; procure federal
aid therefor whenever feasible; and take any measures which may, in the
governor's opinion, secure, stimulate, or increase similar activities by
private or public persons or organizations.  Chapter 103D, sections 103-50,
103-50.5, 103-53, 103-55, 105-1 to 105-10, and 464-4 shall not apply to any
civil defense or other emergency functions if and to the extent that the
governor finds that the provisions, in whole or in part, impede or tend to
impede the expeditious discharge of the functions, or that compliance therewith
is impracticable due to existing conditions.  In cases of extreme urgency during
a civil defense emergency period the governor may suspend the penal provisions
of sections 46-45 and 103-9, except those provisions that concern
falsification;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (11)  Appoint, employ, train, equip, and maintain, with
compensation, or on a volunteer basis without compensation and without regard
to chapters 76, 78, and 88, such agencies, officers, and other persons as the
governor deems necessary to carry out this chapter; determine to what extent
any law prohibiting the holding of more than one office or employment applies
to the agencies, officers, and other persons; and subject to section 128-15,
provide for and effect the interchange of personnel, by detail, transfer, or
otherwise, between the State and any political subdivision, or among any
agencies or departments of the State;</p>

by this chapter are in addition to any other powers or authority conferred upon
the governor by the laws of the United States and of the State for the same or
a like purpose, and shall not be construed as abrogating, limiting, or
modifying any such powers, or authority. [L 1951, c 268, pt of §2; RL 1955,
