shareholders of the issuing public corporation shall be called pursuant to
section 414&#8209;122, to vote on the proposed control share acquisition.  The

power of all shares entitled to vote which are not beneficially owned by the
acquiring person.  A class or series of shares of the corporation is entitled
to vote as a class or series if any provision of the control share acquisition
would, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles, entitle the class
or series to vote as a class or series; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The proposed control share acquisition is
consummated within one hundred eighty days after shareholder approval. [L 2001,
