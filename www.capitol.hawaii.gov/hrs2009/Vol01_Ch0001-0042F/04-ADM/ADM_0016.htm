<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §16.</b>  (a)  Notwithstanding the admission
of the State of Hawaii into the Union, the United States shall continue to have
sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the area which may then or thereafter be
included in Hawaii National Park, saving, however, to the State of Hawaii the
same rights as are reserved to the Territory of Hawaii by section 1 of the Act
of April&nbsp;19, 1930 (46 Stat. 227), and saving, further, to persons then or
thereafter residing within such area the right to vote at all elections held
within the political subdivisions where they respectively reside.  Upon the
admission of said State all references to the Territory of Hawaii in said Act
or in other laws relating to Hawaii National Park shall be deemed to refer to
the State of Hawaii.  Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to
affect the ownership and control by the United States of any lands or other
property within Hawaii National Park which may now belong to, or which may
hereafter be acquired by, the United States.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Notwithstanding the admission of the State
of Hawaii into the Union, authority is reserved in the United States, subject
to the proviso hereinafter set forth, for the exercise by the Congress of the
United States of the power of exclusive legislation, as provided by article I,
section 8, clause 17, of the Constitution of the United States, in all cases
whatsoever over such tracts or parcels of land as, immediately prior to the
admission of said State, are controlled or owned by the United States and held
for Defense or Coast Guard purposes, whether such lands were acquired by
cession and transfer to the United States by the Republic of Hawaii and set
aside by Act of Congress or by Executive order or proclamation of the President
or the Governor of Hawaii for the use of the United States, or were acquired by
the United States by purchase, condemnation, donation, exchange, or otherwise: 
Provided, (i) That the State of Hawaii shall always have the right to serve
civil or criminal process within the said tracts or parcels of land in suits or
prosecutions for or on account of rights acquired, obligations incurred, or
crimes committed within the said State but outside of the said tracts or
parcels of land; (ii) that the reservation of authority in the United States
for the exercise by the Congress of the United States of the power of exclusive
legislation over the lands aforesaid shall not operate to prevent such lands
from being a part of the State of Hawaii, or to prevent the said State from
exercising over or upon such lands, concurrently with the United States, any
jurisdiction whatsoever which it would have in the absence of such reservation
of authority and which is consistent with the laws hereafter enacted by the
Congress pursuant to such reservation of authority; and (iii) that such power
of exclusive legislation shall vest and remain in the United States only so
long as the particular tract or parcel of land involved is controlled or owned
by the United States and used for Defense or Coast Guard purposes:  Provided,
however, That the United States shall continue to have sole and exclusive
jurisdiction over such military installations as have been heretofore or
hereafter determined to be critical areas as delineated by the President of the
United States and/or the Secretary of Defense.</p>
