<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §83.  Laws continued in force.</b>  That the
laws of Hawaii relative to the judicial department, including civil and
criminal procedure, except as amended by this Act, are continued in force,
subject to modification by Congress, or the legislature.  The provisions of
said laws or any laws of the Republic of Hawaii which require juries to be
composed of aliens or foreigners only, or to be constituted by impaneling
natives of Hawaii only, in civil and criminal cases specified in said laws, are
repealed, and all juries shall hereafter be constituted without reference to
the race or place of nativity of the jurors; but no person who is not a citizen
of the United States and twenty-one years of age and who cannot understandingly
speak, read, and write the English language shall be a qualified juror or grand
juror in the Territory of Hawaii.  No person shall be convicted in any criminal
case except by unanimous verdict of the jury.  No plaintiff or defendant in any
suit or proceeding in a court of the Territory of Hawaii shall be entitled to a
trial by a jury impaneled exclusively from persons of any race.  Until
otherwise provided by the legislature of the Territory, grand juries may be
drawn in the manner provided by the Hawaiian statutes for drawing petty juries,
and shall sit at such times as the circuit judges of the respective circuits
shall direct; the number of grand jurors in each circuit shall be not less than
thirteen, and the method of the presentation of cases to said grand jurors
shall be prescribed by the supreme court of the Territory of Hawaii.  The
several circuit courts may subpoena witnesses to appear before the grand jury
in like manner as they subpoena witnesses to appear before their respective
courts. [Am April&nbsp;1, 1952, c 127, 66 Stat 32]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  See 35 H. for rules prescribed under this § for presentation
of cases to grand juries.  On juries between annexation and establishment of
territorial government, see note to Joint Resolution of Annexation RLH 1955,
page 13.  See 21 H. 548, as to nonliability of circuit judge in damages for
official acts in excess, but not in clear absence, of jurisdiction under this
section.  A single circuit judge cannot require an oath of secrecy by a witness
before a grand jury:  17 H. 341; nor can a circuit judge require proposed
witnesses to give recognizances, or commit them to jail without giving them an
opportunity to do so, to appear and testify, when the accused has not been
committed or is not held to await the action of the grand jury and no
indictment is under consideration by the grand jury:  20 H. 453.  This § did
not repeal so much of the Hawaiian laws relating to the drawing of juries as to
leave the rest inoperative:  15 H. 602.  Objections to manner of drawing grand
juries, waived, unless presented at first opportunity:  13 H. 413; 15 H. 613;
15 H. 141.  Accused has no right to appear before grand jury or have witnesses
for him heard by it:  15 H. 613.  The right, if any, to assistance of counsel
at impanelment of grand jury is waived, if not claimed, though accused is in
prison:  15 H. 613.  Disqualifications of grand jurors (e.g., noncitizenship)
do not destroy the jurisdiction of the court or make the indictment void, and
cannot sustain a collateral attack by habeas corpus:  211 U.S. 148.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Verdicts must be unanimous under this act, but unanimity may
be waived in civil cases:  13 H. 705; petty offenses may be tried by magistrate
without a jury notwithstanding a demand for trial by jury:  27 H. 844; see also
20 H. 614, 23 H. 91, and 23 H. 766, as well as the next two cases cited herein;
a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for a year, is not an infamous offense
and does not require an indictment, and in such case trial by jury, while
required if demanded, may be waived:  17 H. 432, 439; and a case of conspiracy
may be tried by consent by eleven jurors:  20 H. 74, 95; and trial by jury may
be waived in civil cases:  15 H. 59.  Waiver of jury in felony case:  33 H.
113.  Trial of suit for over $20 may be before district magistrate first, if
jury is provided for on appeal:  14 H. 290; but an issuance of execution in
such case by the magistrate pending appeal would be unconstitutional:  14 H.
524; although a requirement of a bond for the payment of the judgment as a
condition of appeal would be constitutional:  15 H. 590.  This § does not make
applicable to the federal court a territorial statute making successive
disagreements of two juries operate as an acquittal:  4 U.S.D.C. Haw. 466. 
Referred to in 23 Ops. 543; 13 H. 481, 556; 16 H. 245, 253, 266, 747; 18 H. 539,
645; 20 H. 243, 256; 21 H. 539; 187 U.S. 309; 190 U.S. 211; 217 U.S. 244; 1
U.S.D.C. Haw. 43.</p>
