<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §39-55 </b> <b>Sale of revenue bonds.</b> 
(a)  The director of finance may make such arrangements as may be necessary or
proper for the sale of each issue of revenue bonds or part thereof as are
issued pursuant to this part, including, without limitation, arranging for the
preparation and printing of the revenue bonds, the official statement and any
other documents or instruments deemed required for the issuance and sale of
revenue bonds and retaining such financial, accounting and legal consultants,
all upon such terms and conditions as the director of finance deems advisable
and in the best interest of the State.  The department head or the governing
body may offer the revenue bonds at competitive sale or may negotiate the sale
of the revenue bonds to any person or group of persons, to the United States of
America, or any board, agency, instrumentality, or corporation thereof, to the
employees retirement system of the State, to any political subdivision of the
State, or to any board, agency, instrumentality, public corporation, or other
governmental organization of the State or of any political subdivision of the
State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The sale of the revenue bonds by the
department head or the governing body by negotiation shall be at such price or
prices, and upon such terms and conditions, and the revenue bonds shall bear
interest at such rate or rates or such varying rates determined from time to
time in the manner as the department head or the governing body, with the
approval of the governor, shall approve.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The sale of the revenue bonds by the
department head or the governing body at competitive sale shall be at such
price or prices and upon such terms and conditions, and the revenue bonds shall
bear interest at such rate or rates or such varying rates determined from time
to time in the manner as specified by the successful bidder, and the revenue
bonds shall be sold in accordance with this subsection.  The revenue bonds
offered at competitive sale shall be sold only after published notice of sale
advising prospective purchasers of the proposed sale.  The revenue bonds
offered at competitive sale may be sold to the bidder offering to purchase the
revenue bonds at the lowest interest cost, the interest cost, for the purpose
of this subsection, being determined on any one of the following bases as
selected by the department head or the governing body, with the approval of the
governor:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The figure obtained by adding together the
amounts of interest payable on the revenue bonds from their date to their
respective maturity dates at the rate or rates specified by the bidder and
deducting from the sum obtained the amount of any premium offered by the
bidder;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Where the interest on the revenue bonds is
payable annually, the annual interest rate (compounded annually), or where the
interest on the revenue bonds is payable semiannually, the rate obtained by
doubling the semiannual interest rate (compounded semiannually), necessary to
discount the principal and interest payments on the revenue bonds from the
dates of payment thereof to the date of the revenue bonds and to the price bid
(the price bid for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include the amount
of interest accrued on the revenue bonds from their date to the date of
delivery and payment); or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Where the interest on the revenue bonds is
payable other than annually or semiannually or will vary from time to time upon
such basis as, in the opinion of the department head or the governing body,
shall result in the lowest cost to the State;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that in any case the right shall be
reserved to reject any or all bids and waive any irregularity or informality in
any bid.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Revenue bonds offered at competitive sale,
without further action, shall bear interest at the rate or rates specified by
the successful bidder or the varying rates determined from time to time in the
manner specified by the successful bidder with the consent of the department
head or the governing body.  The notice of sale required by this section shall
be given at least once and at least five days prior to the date of the sale in
the State and in a financial newspaper or newspapers published in any of the
cities of New York, Chicago, or San Francisco, and shall be in a form and
contain terms and conditions that the department head or the governing body
shall determine.  The notice of sale shall comply with the requirements of this
section if it merely advises prospective purchasers of the proposed sale and
makes reference to a detailed notice of sale which is available to prospective
purchasers and which sets forth the specific details of the revenue bonds and
terms and conditions upon which any revenue bonds are to be offered.  The
notice of sale and any detailed notice of sale may omit the date and time of
sale, in which event the date and time shall be either given in the same manner
and medium in which the original notice of sale was given or transmitted via
electronic communication systems deemed proper by the department head or the
governing body, which are generally available to the financial community, in
either case at least twenty-four hours prior to the time fixed for the sale.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  A governing body may delegate the
responsibility for any or all of the determinations or actions to the member
who is the presiding officer or to the executive director or other officer of
the board, commission, agency, authority or public corporation,
instrumentality, or other body. [L 1988, c 28, pt of §3; am L 1998, c 2, §12]</p>
