association with the national popular vote winner.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     At least six days before the day fixed by law

designated as the national popular vote winner shall have the power to nominate

promptly notify the chief executive of all other states of when this agreement
has been enacted and has taken effect in that official's state, when the state
has withdrawn from this agreement, and when this agreement takes effect
generally.</p>
