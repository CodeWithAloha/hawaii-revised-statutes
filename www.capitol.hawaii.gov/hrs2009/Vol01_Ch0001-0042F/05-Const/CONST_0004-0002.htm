COMMISSION</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>Section 2.</b>  A reapportionment commission
shall be constituted on or before May&nbsp;1 of each reapportionment year and
whenever reapportionment is required by court order.  The commission shall
consist of nine members.  The president of the senate and the speaker of the
house of representatives shall each select two members.  Members of each house
belonging to the party or parties different from that of the president or the
speaker shall designate one of their number for each house and the two so
designated shall each select two members of the commission.  The eight members
so selected, promptly after selection, shall be certified by the selecting
authorities to the chief election officer and within thirty days thereafter,
shall select, by a vote of six members, and promptly certify to the chief
election officer the ninth member who shall serve as chairperson of the
commission.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Each of the four officials designated above as
selecting authorities for the eight members of the commission, at the time of
the commission selections, shall also select one person from each basic island
unit to serve on an apportionment advisory council for that island unit.  The
councils shall remain in existence during the life of the commission and each
shall serve in an advisory capacity to the commission for matters affecting its
island unit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     A vacancy in the commission or a council shall
be filled by the initial selecting authority within fifteen days after the
vacancy occurs.  Commission and council positions and vacancies not filled
within the times specified shall be filled promptly thereafter by the supreme
court.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The commission shall act by majority vote of
its membership and shall establish its own procedures, except as may be
provided by law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Not more than one hundred fifty days from the
date on which its members are certified, the commission shall file with the
chief election officer a reapportionment plan for the state legislature and a
reapportionment plan for the United States congressional districts which shall
become law after publication as provided by law.  Members of the commission
shall hold office until each reapportionment plan becomes effective or until
such time as may be provided by law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     No member of the reapportionment commission or
an apportionment advisory council shall be eligible to become a candidate for
election to either house of the legislature or to the United States House of
Representatives in either of the first two elections under any such
reapportionment plan.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Commission and apportionment advisory council
members shall be compensated and reimbursed for their necessary expenses as
provided by law.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The chief election officer shall be secretary
of the commission without vote and, under the direction of the commission, shall
furnish all necessary technical services.  The legislature shall appropriate
funds to enable the commission to carry out its duties. [Add Const Con 1978 and
election Nov 7, 1978; am HB 2322 (1992) and election Nov&nbsp;3, 1992]</p>
