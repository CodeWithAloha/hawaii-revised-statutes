<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§431:14-107  Rating organizations.</b>  (a) 
A corporation, an unincorporated association, a partnership, or an individual,
whether located within or outside this State, may make application to the
commissioner for license as a rating organization for such classes of insurance
or subdivision or class of risk, or a part or combination thereof, as are
specified in its application and shall file the following with the application:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A copy of its constitution, charter, its articles
of organization, agreement, association, or incorporation, and a copy of its
bylaws, plan of operation, and any other rules and regulations governing the
conduct of its business;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A list of its members and subscribers;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The name and address of a resident of this State
upon whom notices or orders of the commissioner or process affecting the rating
organization may be served;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  A statement of its qualifications as a rating
organization;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  A biography of the ownership and management of
the organization; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Any other relevant information and documents that
the commissioner may require.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If the commissioner finds that the
applicant is competent, trustworthy, and otherwise qualified to act as a rating
organization and that its constitution, articles of organization, agreement,
association, or incorporation, and its bylaws, rules and regulations governing
the conduct of its business conform to the requirements of law, the
commissioner shall issue a license specifying the classes of insurance or
subdivision or class of risk, or part or combination thereof, for which the
applicant is authorized to act as a rating organization.  Every such
application shall be granted or denied in whole or in part by the commissioner
within sixty days of the date of its filing with the commissioner.  Licenses
issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect for three years unless
sooner suspended or revoked by the commissioner.  The fee for the license shall
be $37.50.  Licenses issued pursuant to this section may be suspended or revoked
by the commissioner after hearing upon notice, in the event the rating
organization ceases to meet the requirements of subsections (a) and (b).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Every rating organization shall notify the
commissioner promptly of every material change in the documents or information
filed pursuant to subsection (a).</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (d)  (1)  Subject to rules that have been approved by
the commissioner as reasonable, each rating organization shall permit any
insurer, not a member, to be a subscriber to its rating services for any class
of insurance or subdivision or class of risk, or a part or combination thereof,
for which it is authorized to act as a rating organization.  Notice of proposed
changes in the rules shall be given to subscribers.  Each rating organization
shall furnish its rating services without discrimination to its members and
subscribers.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The reasonableness of any rule in its application
to subscribers, or the refusal of any rating organization to admit an insurer
as a subscriber, shall, at the request of any subscriber or any such insurer,
be reviewed by the commissioner at a hearing held upon at least ten days'
written notice to such rating organization and to the subscriber or insurer. 
If the commissioner finds that the rule is unreasonable in its application to
subscribers, the commissioner shall order that the rule shall not be applicable
to subscribers.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  If the rating organization fails to grant or
reject an insurer's application for subscribership within thirty days after it
was made, the insurer may request a review by the commissioner, in accordance
with paragraph (2), as if the application had been rejected.  If the
commissioner finds that the insurer has been refused admittance to the rating
organization as a subscriber without justification, the commissioner shall
order the rating organization to admit the insurer as a subscriber.  If the
commissioner finds that the action of the rating organization was justified,
the commissioner shall make an order affirming its action.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  No rating organization shall adopt any
rule the effect of which would be to prohibit or regulate the payment of
dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by
insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Cooperation among rating organizations or
among rating organizations and insurers in matters within the scope of this
article is authorized, provided the filings resulting from the cooperation are
subject to all the provisions of this article which are applicable to filings
generally.  The commissioner may review the cooperative activities and
practices and if, after a hearing, the commissioner finds that any activity or
practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with this article,
the commissioner may issue a written order specifying in what respects the
activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with
this article, and requiring the discontinuance of the activity or practice.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Any rating organization may provide for
the examination of policies, daily reports, binders, renewal certificates,
endorsements, or other evidences of insurance, or the cancellation thereof, and
may make reasonable rules governing their submission.  The rules shall contain
a provision that in the event any insurer does not within sixty days furnish
satisfactory evidence to the rating organization of the correction of any error
or omission previously called to its attention by the rating organization, it
shall be the duty of the rating organization to notify the commissioner
thereof.  All information submitted for examination shall be confidential.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Any rating organization may subscribe for
or purchase actuarial, technical or other services, and such services shall be
available to all members and subscribers without discrimination. [L 1987, c
347, pt of §2; am L 1990, c 255, §11; am L 1993, c 205, §33; am L 2004, c 122,
