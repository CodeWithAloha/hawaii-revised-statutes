Except as otherwise provided by law, no person shall practice medicine or
surgery in the State, either gratuitously or for pay, or offer to practice
medicine or surgery in the State, or advertise or announce one's self, either
publicly or privately, as prepared or qualified to practice medicine or surgery
in the State, or append the letters &quot;Dr.&quot;, &quot;M.D.&quot;, or
&quot;D.O.&quot; to one's name with the intent to imply that the person is a
practitioner of medicine or surgery, without having a valid unrevoked license
or a limited and temporary license obtained from the Hawaii medical board.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Nothing herein shall:</p>

another state when in actual consultation, including in-person, mail,
electronic, telephonic, fiber-optic, or other telemedicine consultation with a
licensed physician or osteopathic physician of this State, if the physician or

and control of a physician or osteopathic physician licensed in this State
except for final refraction resulting in a prescription for spectacles, contact
lenses, or visual training as performed by an oculist or optometrist duly
licensed by the State.  The direction and control shall not be construed in
every case to require the personal presence of the supervising and controlling
physician or osteopathic physician.  Any physician or osteopathic physician who
employs or directs a person certified under part II of this chapter to provide
emergency medical services, or a physician assistant, shall retain full
professional and personal responsibility for any act that constitutes the

medicine or a doctor of osteopathy certified in radiology by the American Board
of Radiology or the American Board of Osteopathy.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>              &quot;Telemedicine&quot; means the use of
telecommunications services, as that term is defined in section 269-1,
including real-time video conferencing-based communication, secure interactive

healing practices by traditional Hawaiian healers engaged in traditional Native
Hawaiian healing practices, both as recognized and certified as such by any
kupuna council convened by Papa Ola Lokahi.  No person or organization involved
with the selection of kupuna council members, the convening of a kupuna
