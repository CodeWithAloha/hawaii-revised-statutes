<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §286-52.5  Procedure when registration of a
trailer transferred.</b>  (a)  Upon transfer of registered ownership in or to a
trailer, the person whose interest is to be transferred and the transferee
shall write their signatures with pen and ink upon the certificate of
registration issued for the trailer, together with the address of the
transferee in the appropriate space provided upon the certificate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Within thirty calendar days of the
transfer of registered ownership of a trailer, the transferee shall forward the
certificate of registration to the director of finance who shall file the
certificate.  Whenever a transferee fails to comply with this section, the
director of finance shall charge the transferee a fee of $50, in addition to
the fee provided in this section, for the issuance of a new certificate of
registration.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the director of finance has ascertained
as of the date of the application that the registered owner has not deposited
or paid bail with respect to any summons or citation issued to the registered
owner for stopping, standing, or parking in violation of traffic ordinances
within the county, the director may require, as a condition precedent to the
transfer, that the registered owner deposit or pay bail with respect to all
such summonses or citations.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The director of finance, upon receipt of
the certificate of registration properly endorsed, shall register the trailer
and shall issue to the owner thereof by reason of the transfer a new
certificate of registration in the manner and form provided for original
registration.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Until the director of finance has issued
the new certificate of registration as provided in subsection (d), delivery of
such trailer shall be deemed not to have been made and registration thereto
shall be deemed not to have passed, and the intended transfer shall be deemed
to be incomplete and not to be valid or effective for any purpose.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  In the event of the transfer by operation
of law in or to a trailer registered under section 286-47.2, as upon inheritance,
devise, or bequest, order in bankruptcy, or insolvency, execution sale,
repossession upon default in performance of the terms of a lease or executory
sales contract, or otherwise than by the voluntary act of the person whose
interest is to be transferred, the certificate of registration shall be signed
upon the spaces provided by the personal representative of, or successor in
interest of the person whose registered ownership or interest is so transferred
in lieu of such person.  Every personal representative, receiver, trustee,
sheriff, or other personal representative hereinabove referred to shall file
with the director of finance a notice of any transfer by sale, lease, or
otherwise by the person, of any such trailer, together with evidence satisfactory
to the director of finance of all facts entitling such representative to make
the transfer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Any person who refuses or neglects to
deliver a certificate of registration to a transferee entitled thereto under
this section, shall be punished as provided in section 286-61.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Every dealer or manufacturer, upon
transferring a trailer, whether by sale, lease, or otherwise, shall immediately
give notice of the transfer to the director of finance upon the official form
provided by the director of finance.  Every such notice shall contain the date
of transfer, the names and addresses of the transferor and transferee, and such
description of the trailer as may be called for in the official form.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (i)  Every person, other than a dealer or
manufacturer, upon transferring a trailer, whether by sale, lease, or
otherwise, shall within ten days give notice of the transfer to the director of
finance upon the official form provided by the director of finance.  Every
notice shall contain the date of transfer, the names and addresses of the
transferor and transferee, and such description of the trailer as may be called
for in the official form.  Any person who violates this subsection shall be
fined not more than $100.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  Whenever the registered owner of any
trailer or any dealer or manufacturer has given notice to the director of
finance of a transfer of the registered ownership to the trailer, as provided
in subsections (h) and (i), and has delivered the certificate of registration
bearing the transferor's signature to the transferee as required by subsection
(a), the transferor shall be relieved from liability, civil or criminal, which
the transferor might subsequently incur by reason of being the registered owner
of the trailer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  A dealer or manufacturer who has forwarded
a properly endorsed certificate of registration to the director of finance
shall be relieved of any civil liability, only if, in addition to the
requirement of subsection (j), the dealer or manufacturer obtains from the
transferee a specific written authorization to forward the certificate.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (l)  Any person who falsely or fraudulently
gives notice to the director of finance of a transfer of registered ownership
to a trailer shall be subject to the penalty provided in section 286-61.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (m)  The director of finance may charge a fee
which shall be deposited in the general fund for each new certificate of
registration issued.  The fee charged to issue a new certificate of
registration shall be established by the county's legislative body. [L 1985, c
27, pt of §1; am L 1989, c 211, §10; am L 1990, c 281, §11; am L 1999, c 219,
