director may delegate to any person such power and authority, vested in the

effective administration of this chapter, except the power to make rules or
regulations, and may in the director's discretion bond any person handling

application therefor.  The director may require such reports, make such
investigations, and take such other action as the director deems necessary or
suitable for the administration of this chapter.</p>

covering all persons employed in the administration of this chapter shall be

act to provide for the establishment of a national employment system and for cooperation
with the states in the promotion of such system, and for other purposes&quot;,
approved June&nbsp;6, 1933, as amended.  The director may adopt such
regulations applicable with respect to all persons employed in the

subsection, and meeting the personnel standards promulgated by the Secretary of
Labor, shall be applied with respect to all persons employed in the
administration of this chapter.</p>

of Congress entitled &quot;An act to prevent pernicious political
activities&quot;, as amended, and that such violation warrants the removal of
the person from the person's employment.</p>

attorney general assigned by the attorney general to furnish the legal services
necessary in carrying out this chapter shall be compensated by the director. [L
