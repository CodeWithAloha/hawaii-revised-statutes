subordinate of the sheriff or chief of police, the regular fee for such service
shall be payable to such subordinate.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed
to prohibit the police commission of any county from requiring all such fees,
mileage, and expenses to be paid into a police benefit fund. [CC 1859, §1278;
