<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A list of conditionally approved animals that require a permit for import into the State;</P>

<P>&#9;(b)  The board shall adopt rules, pursuant to chapter 91, to establish an advisory committee of no fewer than three members with applicable expertise in vertebrate biology to identify whether an animal is a prohibited hybrid animal when the department suspects that the lineage of the animal is not as stated by the owner or on other official documents.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Animals on the lists of conditionally approved and restricted animals shall be imported only by permit.  Any animal that is not on the lists of conditionally approved, restricted, or prohibited animals shall be prohibited until the board's review and determination for placement on one of these lists; provided that the department may issue a special permit on a case-by-case basis for the importation and possession of an animal that is not on the lists of prohibited, restricted, or conditionally approved animals, for the purpose of remediating medical emergencies or agricultural or ecological disasters, or conducting medical or scientific research in a manner that the animal will not be detrimental to agriculture, the environment, or humans, if the importer of the animal can meet permit requirements as determined by the board; and provided further that the department may issue a short-term special permit on a case-by-case basis not to exceed ninety days for the importation and possession of an animal that is not on the lists of prohibited, restricted, or conditionally approved animals for the purpose of filming, performance, or exhibition, if the importer of the animal can meet permit and bonding requirements as determined by the board.
