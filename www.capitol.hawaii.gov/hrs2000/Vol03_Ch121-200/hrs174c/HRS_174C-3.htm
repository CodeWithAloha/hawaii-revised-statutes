The fact that some parts of the bed or channel have been dredged or improved does not prevent the watercourse from being a stream.</P>
<P>&#9;"Stream channel" means a natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and banks which periodically or continuously contains flowing water.  The channel referred to is that which exists at the present time, regardless of where the channel may have been located at any time in the past.</P>

Water from natural springs is surface water when it exits from the spring onto the earth's surface.</P>

<P>&#9;"Time of withdrawal or diversion" means, in view of the nature, manner, and purposes of a reasonable and beneficial use of water, the most accurate method of describing the time when the water is withdrawn or diverted, including description in terms of hours, days, weeks, months, or physical, operational, or other conditions.</P>

<P>&#9;"Water source" means a place within or from which water is or may be developed, including but not limited to:  (1) generally, an area such as a watershed defined by topographic boundaries, or a definitive ground water body; and (2) specifically, a particular stream, other surface water body, spring, tunnel, or well or related combination thereof.</P>
<P>&#9;"Well" means an artificial excavation or opening into the ground, or an artificial enlargement of a natural opening by which ground water is drawn or is or may be used or can be made to be usable to supply reasonable and beneficial uses within the State.
