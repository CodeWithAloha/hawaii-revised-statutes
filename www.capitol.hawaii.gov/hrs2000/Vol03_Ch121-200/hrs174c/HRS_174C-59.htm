<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The conditions of use of the permit, including, but not limited to, place, quantity, and purpose of the use, remain the same; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The commission is informed of the transfer within ninety days.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;Failure to inform the commission of the transfer invalidates the transfer and constitutes a ground for revocation of the permit.  A transfer which involves a change in any condition of the permit, including a change in use covered in section 174C-57, is also invalid and constitutes a ground for revocation.
