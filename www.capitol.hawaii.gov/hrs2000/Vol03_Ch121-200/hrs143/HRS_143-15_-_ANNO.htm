<P>  The plain language and legislative history of this section and §143-16 made very clear that legislature intended to authorize county reliance upon private humane societies to impound stray dogs within their borders; this can be accomplished only if §§76-16(17) and 76-77(10) are interpreted broadly.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</P>
