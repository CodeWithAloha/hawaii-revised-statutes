</B>
<P>  Felon convicted of possessing firearm properly sentenced under this section instead of §706-610.  68 H. 622, 725 P.2d 799.</P>
<P>  Defendant exercised control when defendant sold gun.  70 H. 219, 768 P.2d 230.</P>
<P>  Previously convicted felon must have intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly possessed or controlled the firearm.  70 H. 509, 778 P.2d 704.</P>
<P>  Defendant may not assert the invalidity of the prior conviction as a defense under this section.  71 H. 101, 784 P.2d 872.</P>
<P>  Convicted person may not assert the invalidity of the prior offense as a defense to this section.  71 H. 111, 784 P.2d 873.</P>
<P>  Subsection (b) applies to felons who are convicted through a nolo contendere plea.  83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Where defendant’s convictions were premised upon the use of "any firearm" and language of indictments and trial court’s instructions "to wit, a semiautomatic pistol" did not alter the statutory elements of §§708-840, 134-6, or this section, trial court’s error of not providing definition of "semiautomatic firearm" did not warrant reversal of convictions of first degree robbery, carrying or use of firearm in commission of separate felony, or felon in possession of firearm.  91 H. 33, 979 P.2d 1059.</P>
<P>  Requisite state of mind for a violation of subsection (b) is that of acting intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; failure to instruct jury on state of mind element, as required by §701-114(1)(b), was prejudicial and not harmless error.  78 H. 422 (App.), 895 P.2d 173.</P>
<P>  Where State failed to establish defendant's prior felony conviction and no lesser included offense of a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition in chapter 134, defendant's convictions of being a felon in possession of a firearm and firearm ammunition under subsection (b) reversed.  82 H. 517 (App.), 923 P.2d 934.</P>
<P>  Under subsection (b), multiple punishments are not authorized for violating the prohibition against possession of "any firearm or ammunition therefor"; thus, where defendant was already convicted of possessing a firearm, defendant could not be convicted for possession of ammunition loaded into that firearm.  89 H. 59 (App.), 968 P.2d 1070.</P>
<P>  Under the Hawaii Penal Code, the word "possess" in subsection (b) means to (1) knowingly procure or receive a firearm or ammunition, or (2) be aware of one's own control over a firearm for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate that possession.  89 H. 59 (App.), 968 P.2d 1070.</P>
<P>  Although evidence that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony was relevant for purposes of this section, evidence that defendant may have received ineffective assistance of counsel during that prior felony trial would not have any bearing on the validity of that felony conviction; thus, trial court did not err in precluding evidence that defendant may have received ineffective assistance during prior trial.  90 H. 489 (App.), 979 P.2d 85.</P>
<P>  Unless expressly permitted by the court, subsection (f) unqualifiedly prohibits a person subject to a chapter 586 order from possession and control of a firearm during the pendency of that order; this prohibition is effective irrespective of whether the respondent owned the firearms involved.  91 H. 438 (App.), 984 P.2d 1264.</P>
<P>  Mentioned:  9 H. App. 333, 839 P.2d 1186.</P>
