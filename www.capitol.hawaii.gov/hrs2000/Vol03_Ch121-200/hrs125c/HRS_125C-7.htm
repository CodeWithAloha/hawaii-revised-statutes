All fees or charges collected for services furnished or petroleum products sold, all moneys borrowed, and all contributions or grants of money received under this chapter shall be deposited in this fund; provided that the governor may establish other suitable funds in the state treasury for the deposit and separate accounting of moneys contributed or granted for special purposes under this chapter.  All moneys in the petroleum products control fund are appropriated for the purposes of this chapter and shall be expended by the governor or the governor's authorized representative.  The governor or the governor's authorized representative may expend and use the moneys in the petroleum products control fund to purchase petroleum products, to obtain services, equipment, materials, and supplies necessary under this chapter, and to repay moneys borrowed under this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The governor's authorized representative shall submit requests to the governor to withdraw moneys from the petroleum products control fund as may be necessary for expenditure, by or under the direction of the governor, for immediate relief in the event of a shortage, or when the governor determines a shortage to be imminent and unavoidable; provided that not more than $500,000 shall be expended for the immediate relief of any single shortage.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In expending the moneys, the governor's authorized representative may allot any portion thereof to any state or county agency, office, or employee, for relief of the conditions created by the shortage.  The governor may determine whether a shortage contemplated by this section has occurred, or is imminent and unavoidable.  The determination of the governor in this matter shall be conclusive.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The governor's authorized representative may expend funds from the petroleum products control fund during ordinary petroleum market conditions for planning and preparation to respond to a shortage. [L 1975, c 38, pt of §1; am L 1984, c 238, §6; gen ch 1985; am L 1992, c 182, §4]</P>
