</B>
<P>  In setting aside Hawaiian home lands, federal government undertook trust obligation benefitting aboriginal people.  State assumed fiduciary obligation upon being admitted as a state.  Commission's considerations gave undue weight to interests of State, county, and citizens or taxpayers generally, thus breaching fiduciary duty.  64 H. 327, 640 P.2d 1161.</P>
