</B>
<P>  In broadest sense, to be a "general law" must operate in all counties, but a law may apply to less than all counties and still be "general law" if it applies uniformly to a class of counties.  50 H. 51, 430 P.2d 321.</P>
<P>  This provision not violated by Act 47, SL 1967, providing for filling vacancy in office of county chairperson.  50 H. 51, 430 P.2d 321.</P>
<P>  Subject to this provision requiring "general laws," the legislature is free to enact any legislation affecting the powers of political subdivisions, including amendment of charter provisions adopted pursuant to section 2 of this article.  50 H. 277, 439 P.2d 206.</P>
<P>  Generally on functions of statewide interest, if counties are not given specific authority, they cannot thwart the State.  56 H. 582, 545 P.2d 684.</P>
