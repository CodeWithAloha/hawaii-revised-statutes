<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Enter into agreements with trustees, within or without the State, to hold financing agreement proceeds, payments, and reserves as security for lenders to accept assignments of rights in the financing agreement from, and to enforce such rights of, the lessor or other party thereto, and to issue certificates of participation for the right to receive payments due from the agency under a financing agreement.  Amounts held by a trustee shall be invested by the trustee at the direction of the agency in such investments as shall be specified in the agreement with the trustee.  Interest earned on any investment held by a trustee as security for a financing agreement may, at the option of the agency, be credited to the accounts held by the trustee and applied in payment of sums due under a financing agreement;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Enter into credit enhancement agreements for financing agreements or certificates of participation; provided that the credit enhancement agreements shall be payable solely from available funds and amounts received from the exercise of property rights granted under such financing agreements;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Use financing agreements to finance the costs of acquiring or refinancing property, plus the costs of reserves and credit enhancements and costs associated with obtaining the financing;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Use a single financing agreement to finance property to be used by multiple agencies;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Grant leases of real property subject to section 37D-2(2).  The leases may be for a term that ends on the date on which all amounts due under a financing agreement have been paid or provision for payment has been made or ten years after the last scheduled payment under a financing agreement, whichever is later.  The leases may grant the lessor the right to evict the agency and exclude it from possession of the real property for the term of the lease, if the agency fails to appropriate or pay when due the amounts scheduled to be paid under a financing agreement or otherwise defaults under a financing agreement.  Upon failure to pay or default, the lessor may sublease the land to third parties and apply any rentals toward payments scheduled to be made under a financing agreement;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Grant security interests in personal property subject to section 37D-2(2).  The security interests shall attach and be perfected on the date the agency takes possession of the personal property, or the date the lender advances money under a financing agreement, whichever is later.  A security interest authorized by this section shall have, except as otherwise provided by law, priority over all other liens and claims.  Upon failure to pay or default, the secured party shall have the rights and remedies available to a secured party under chapter 490 or a first, perfected security interest in goods and fixtures.  No later than ten days after a security interest authorized by this section attaches, the agency shall cause a financing statement for the security interest to be filed with the bureau of conveyances in the same manner as financing statements are filed for goods;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Pledge any amounts that are deposited with a trustee in accordance with a financing agreement.  The pledge shall be valid and binding from the time it is made, the amounts so pledged shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without filing, physical delivery, or other act, and the lien of the pledge shall be superior to all other claims and liens of any kind whatsoever;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Bill any other agency that benefits from property acquired with the proceeds of a financing agreement for an appropriate share of the financing costs, including debt service, on a monthly or other periodic basis, and deposit payments received in connection with the billings with a trustee as security for a financing agreement.  Any agency receiving such a bill shall be authorized and shall pay the amounts billed from the first amounts legally available to it;</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;Purchase fire and extended coverage or other casualty insurance, or liability, title, rental interruption or other insurance for property that is acquired or refinanced with proceeds of a financing agreement, assign the proceeds thereof to a lender or trustee to the extent of their interest, and covenant to maintain such insurance while the financing agreement is unpaid, so long as available funds are sufficient to purchase such insurance; and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)&#9;In connection with any financing agreement by which any agency leases or purchases property from another party, notwithstanding and without regard to chapter 171 or any other law, the agency may lease or sell, on such terms as the agency shall determine, to that party the site or property to be improved or otherwise to be leased or sold back to the agency.
