<P>  Subsection (b):  violates First Amendment to U.S. Constitution because it restricts persons or other entities from making contributions to noncandidate ballot measure committees.  Subsection (j):  statutory provision prohibits contributions based upon length of time that noncandidate committee has been registered; this durational requirement is unconstitutional because it imposes limitations on the right of association and the right of expression when contributions are made to noncandidate committees.  Att. Gen. Op. 98-5.</P>
