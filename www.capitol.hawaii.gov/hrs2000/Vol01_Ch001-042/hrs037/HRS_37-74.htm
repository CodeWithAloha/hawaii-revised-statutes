<P>&#9;(b)  The appropriations by the legislature for a biennium shall be allocated between the two fiscal years of the biennium in the manner provided in the budget or appropriations act and as further prescribed by the director of finance.  The amounts allocated for each fiscal year shall be subject to the allotment system prescribed in chapter 37, part II.  Each agency (except the courts), in estimating its quarterly requirements under chapter 37, part II, shall prepare a plan for the fiscal year for the operation of each of the programs it is responsible for administering.  The operations plan shall be in such form and content as the department of budget and finance may prescribe.  It shall be submitted, together with the estimated quarterly requirements, to the department of budget and finance on such date as the department may prescribe.</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Review each operations plan to determine:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;That it is consistent with the policy decisions of the governor and appropriations by the legislature;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;That it reflects proper planning and efficient management methods; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;That appropriations have been made for the planned purpose and will not be exhausted before the end of the fiscal year;</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;provided that the department of budget and finance shall review the operations plan submitted by the University of Hawaii solely for consistency with the allotment ceilings established by the governor under section 37-34, appropriations by the legislature, the requirements of chapter 37D, and the status of revenues to support operations plans for all state programs;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Approve the operations plan if satisfied that it meets the requirements under paragraph (1).  Otherwise, the department of budget and finance shall require revision of the operations plan in whole or in part; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Modify or withhold the planned expenditures at any time during the appropriation period if the department of budget and finance finds that the expenditures are greater than those necessary to execute the programs at the level authorized by the governor and the legislature, or that state receipts and surpluses will be insufficient to meet the authorized expenditure levels; provided that the planned expenditures for the University of Hawaii may be modified or withheld only in accordance with sections 37-36 and 37-37.</P></DIR>
