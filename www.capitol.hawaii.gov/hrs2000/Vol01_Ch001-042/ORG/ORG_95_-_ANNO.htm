<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>  Fishing rights covered by land commission awards or held under the early laws of Hawaii, are vested rights under this §:  194 U.S. 154, 31 L.R.A. (N.S.) 397 (reversing 14 H. 465); 200 U.S. 255; 16 H. 308.  Requirement that fishing right be established as provided in §96 in order to be valid, is constitutional.  35 H. 608.  Fisheries in streams are not covered by this § though the fish come from the sea:  18 H. 462.  Fisheries free to citizens and alien residents alike before this Act continued so afterwards:  3 U.S.D.C. Haw. 227.  This § repealed the penal remedy provided for in §482, R.L. 1905:  16 H. 307.  This § does not prevent the requirement of a license fee for fishing for profit with a boat of more than a certain width:  19 H. 643.  Congress did not reserve exclusive control over the sea fisheries of the Territory:  21 H. 39 (Ann. Cas. 1915A 1155); 21 H. 631; 31 H. 678.</P>
<P>  Referred to in 39 H. 129.</P>
