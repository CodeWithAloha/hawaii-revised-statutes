<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>  Territorial circuit courts were held to have jurisdiction to naturalize even before the general naturalization act of June&nbsp;26, 1906, which clearly conferred such jurisdiction:  17 H. 295; 211 U.S. 146.  The first paragraph of this § as originally enacted (see RLH 1935) may have been unconstitutional because not "an uniform rule:"  162 Fed. 470; it has been repealed by implication by the general naturalization act above referred to:  Id, overruling 3 U.S.D.C. Haw. 191, and it was specifically repealed Oct.&nbsp;14, 1940.  Referred to in 13 H. 21.  See §4 and note thereto; also citizenship and immigration cases in note to RLH 1955, §57-43.</P>
<P>  Certificates of naturalization granted by the U.S. District Court for Hawaii between January&nbsp;1, 1919 and July&nbsp;1, 1922, validated "insofar as failure of the record to contain final order under the hand of the court is concerned" by the Act of June&nbsp;29, 1938, c 822, 52 Stat 1249.  Referred to in 236 F.2d 622.</P>
