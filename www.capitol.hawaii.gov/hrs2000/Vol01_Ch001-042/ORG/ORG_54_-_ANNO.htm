<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>  The legislature in extra session under this § may divide the biennial period, covering a portion of it by one appropriation bill and the rest by another:  15 H. 361.  The objects for which appropriations may be made in such extra session are not limited to "necessary current expenses," etc.:  15 H. 514, 663.  When a complete appropriation bill was passed for the first six months of the biennial period and only an incomplete one for the last eighteen months because the remainder of the expenses were expected to be provided for by counties, and the county act turned out to be void, there was a "failure" within the meaning of this section, but the "last appropriation bills" to be resorted to were those of the previous biennial period and not those of the first six months of the period in question:  15 H. 532.  Referred to in 16 H. 245.</P>
