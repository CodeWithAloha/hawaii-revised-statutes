<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>  Compare Const. of 1894, Art. 92, §§1-3.  Admiralty cases were included in "other proceedings" under this §, and those then pending continued in the jurisdiction of the territorial courts, though subsequent ones could be brought only in the federal court, and no appeal lay in such pending cases to the federal circuit court of appeals:  13 H. 174; 108 Fed. 113; 183 U.S. 545; 187 U.S. 309.  A petition in 1904 for the removal of a guardian appointed in 1899 is in a proceeding pending in 1899: 197 U.S. 354.  An action by the Territory for taxes due the Republic is not barred:  18 H. 255.  Imprisonment, for contempt, to compel an administrator to pay creditors pro rata is not imprisonment for debt:  19 H. 234; but the execution of a writ of ne exeat, in assumpsit, to obtain security for a judgment that might be recovered would be such imprisonment:  15 H. 413.</P>
<P>  Inhibition against suit on contract for personal service except for damages for breach, does not prevent injunction against exhibition or dealing in moving pictures in violation of contract:  22 H. 550; nor does this provision apply to a contract to have one cultivate on shares land in sugar cane for three crops in a husbandlike manner to the satisfaction of another:  25 H. 558.  On contract labor laws, see note to Joint Resolution of Annexation RLH 1955, page 13.  On applicability to Hawaii of Federal laws against introduction of contract labor, see 27 Ops. 479.
