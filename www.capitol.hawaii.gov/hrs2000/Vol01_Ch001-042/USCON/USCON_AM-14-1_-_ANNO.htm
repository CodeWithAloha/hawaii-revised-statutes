</B><P>  See also notes to Amendment 5.</P>
<P>  Prison regulations do not create a protected liberty interest.  461 U.S. 236.</P>
<P>  Transfer of prisoner to mainland facility did not implicate due process clause directly.  461 U.S. 236.</P>
<P>  Inmate’s discipline in segregated confinement did not present the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a state might conceivably create a liberty interest; neither the Hawaii prison regulation in question, nor the due process clause itself, afforded inmate a protected liberty interest that would entitle inmate to procedural protections set forth in Wolff v. McDonnell.  515 U.S. 472.</P>
<P>  Defendant was not denied due process by alleged prosecutorial misconduct before grand jury.  614 F.2d 214.</P>

<P>  Not violated in termination of physician's staff privileges.  754 F.2d 1420.</P>
<P>  Personal jurisdiction over nonresident manufacturer of military products comports with due process.  785 F.2d 720.</P>
<P>  Not violated where civilians prosecuted differently than military personnel for traffic violations on military bases (reversing 604 F. Supp. 416).  786 F.2d 951.</P>
<P>  Defendant not denied due process by introduction into evidence of photographs showing defendant's front and profile images; court must weigh prejudicial effect of testimony that defendant had "a long police record" against its probative value; prosecution's disclosure of exculpatory evidence at pretrial conference did not violate due process; individual voir dire, when required.  789 F.2d 1425.</P>
<P>  Defendant's conviction violated due process where only evidence was stipulation which followed ambiguous indictment.  796 F.2d 261.</P>
<P>  Admission of videotape of autopsy not fundamentally unfair.  800 F.2d 1463.</P>
<P>  Jury instructions that erroneously characterized murder as a "lesser included offense" of "murder-for-hire" did not warrant relief, but this error, along with others, may cumulatively have deprived defendant of defendant's rights; limitation of witnesses' prior inconsistent statements for impeachment purposes and not for their substance did not violate due process.  807 F.2d 805.</P>
<P>  Defamation, without more is not a constitutional violation.  827 F.2d 1310.</P>
<P>  Boat owner did not have a property right to boat slip where permit to use slip expired automatically.  915 F.2d 528.</P>
<P>  Award for damages to fired city employee for violation of due process rights upheld where city failed to afford employee a pretermination hearing.  963 F.2d 1167.</P>
<P>  Prison rule requiring inmates to communicate in English language only gave inmates insufficient notice that they were forbidden to pray in a foreign language.  994 F.2d 1408.</P>
<P>  Bars State from imposing inmate punishment on the basis of an unexpected and unusual interpretation of prison rule forbidding non-English communication.  15 F.3d 1463.</P>
<P>  State officials performing discretionary function not entitled to qualified immunity if a reasonable official would have known that prison regulation forbidding non-English communication did not forbid foreign language prayer.  15 F.3d 1463.</P>
<P>  Not violated by §286-260 provision allowing for judicial review of administrative revocation of driver's license "as soon as practicable".  17 F.3d 1244.</P>
<P>  Federal wastewater treatment permit not unconstitutionally vague where defendants were knowledgeable in wastewater field, could be expected to have understood what the permit meant, and took considerable pains to conceal their illegal dumping activities. <B> </B>35 F.3d 1275.</P>
<P>  Prison policies not sufficiently "mandatory" to create liberty interest in inmate not being transferred from minimum to medium security facility.  55 F.3d 454.</P>
<P>  Prison regulations on confinement did not create a liberty interest that would entitle inmate to due process protection.  59 F.3d 931.</P>
<P>  No violation where plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. §1983 action against dental board was barred by res judicata as plaintiff failed to seek state court judicial review of dental board's order failing plaintiff on dental exam.  60 F.3d 626.</P>
<P>  At time of alleged misconduct, persons in custody had established right to not have officials remain deliberately indifferent to the persons' serious medical needs.  74 F.3d 977.</P>
<P>  Where landowners argued that ordinance creating mechanism through which condominium owners could convert their leasehold interests into fee simple interests was arbitrary and irrational, landowners could not meet burden of showing irrationality.  124 F.3d 1150.</P>
<P>  Inmate who had never been convicted of a sex offense and had never had opportunity to formally challenge imposition of sex offender label in adversarial setting did not receive required minimum due process protections and was entitled to injunctive relief; inmate who was convicted after formal criminal proceedings of a sex offense received all of process to which inmate was due.  131 F.3d 818.</P>
<P>  Where child protective service caseworker's seven-day delay in filing a court petition for temporary custody violated state law, neither the seven-day delay before obtaining post-deprivation judicial review, nor the seven-day delay before filing a court petition, violated appellant's federal due process rights. 141 F.3d 927.</P>
<P>  Re applicability of due process to out-of-state prison transfers.  387 F. Supp. 912; 396 F. Supp. 196.</P>
<P>  Denying public employment eligibility by erroneous interpretation of law, deprived person of due process.  402 F. Supp. 84.</P>
<P>  Courts are not immune from prohibition against taking without compensation.  402 F. Supp. 95.</P>
<P>  Re court's relocation of private land boundary without due process.  402 F. Supp. 95.</P>
<P>  Law regarding filing of notice of lis pendens held not an unconstitutional seizure of property without due process.  418 F. Supp. 695.</P>

<P>  Garnishment procedures which do not provide safeguards against improper garnishment of AFDC (assistance) grants deny due process.  431 F. Supp. 1369.</P>

<P>  Several provisions of state statutes regarding emergency and nonemergency admission to psychiatric facility violated due process.  438 F. Supp. 1106.</P>
<P>  Hawaii may not change its laws governing property rights of riparian landowners to use of water without compensating owners for lost rights.  441 F. Supp. 559.</P>
<P>  In dispute over water rights, a Supreme Court decision rendered without affording parties a hearing, held to violate procedural due process.  441 F. Supp. 559.</P>
<P>  Since prison authorities are granted practically unlimited discretion to transfer state prisoners and the regulations do not provide standards limiting such discretion, defendant does not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest against transfer.  459 F. Supp. 473.</P>
<P>  Action of Supreme Court decreeing that property seaward of vegetation line belonged to public deprived owners of due process because there was no hearing on title and it was a radical departure from prior law.  460 F. Supp. 473.</P>
<P>  Parents' right to give their child any name they wish is protected from arbitrary state action.  466 F. Supp. 714.</P>
<P>  Law providing for affidavit method of postjudgment garnishment of wages not unconstitutional.  467 F. Supp. 544.</P>

<P>  Parental tort liability statute did not contain irrebuttable presumption.  529 F. Supp. 294.</P>
<P>  Ex parte appointment of receiver did not constitute taking of property without due process.  547 F. Supp. 988.</P>
<P>  Violated by §657<B>-</B>11, which discriminates against actions brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  574 F. Supp. 1510.</P>
<P>  Alleged conduct of police officers truly "shocks the conscience" and offends "the concept of ordered liberty", and thus violates strictures of substantive due process.  584 F. Supp. 356.</P>
<P>  Applicability of "void for vagueness" doctrine; does not apply to county charter provision allocating governmental power.  623 F. Supp. 657.</P>
<P>  Zoning and land use regulations for Queen's Beach rationally related to valid planning goals; landowner not entitled to procedural due process with respect to enactment of zoning regulations, which are legislative acts; landowner and prospective developer did not have vested property rights pursuant to general plan and detailed land use map, thus, passage of restrictive zoning did not deny them due process.  649 F. Supp. 926.</P>
<P>  No denial of due process where the unauthorized wrongful act is not sanctioned by any established state procedure and the state law provides a realistic means for the plaintiff to be made whole.  694 F. Supp. 738.</P>
<P>  Only the United States Supreme Court is empowered to review state court judgments.  735 F. Supp. 963.</P>
<P>  No due process liberty interest in parole is created under §§353<B>-</B>68 and 353<B>-</B>69; inmate had due process liberty interest at stake at misconduct hearing.  795 F. Supp. 1020.</P>
<P>  Forcing inmates to choose between law library time and outdoor exercise unconstitutional; liberty interest not created by prison regulation governing when officials could administratively segregate inmates.  816 F. Supp. 1501.</P>
<P>  Regulation regarding classification of inmates, acting in conjunction with language of classification scoring system, created protectable liberty interest.  Prison policy concerning inmate access to courts, legal services, and legal materials did not create a protectable liberty interest.  Inmate’s claim based on prison policy regarding participation in employment was without merit; while regulation may create protectable interest, inmate offered no evidence that inmate had been denied the right to participate in activities described in the section.  823 F. Supp. 750.</P>
<P>  Any claim based on takings clause of Fourteenth Amendment lacked merit, regarding state mooring regulations; the regulations did not affect plaintiffs in a manner that implicated Fourteenth Amendment.  823 F. Supp. 766.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated their constitutional rights to due process by depriving them of their dwelling without constitutionally adequate process, plaintiffs received adequate due process.  832 F. Supp. 1399.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff alleged that condominium lease-to-fee ordinance violated plaintiff’s substantive due process rights, ordinance was a rational exercise of legislative power. 832 F. Supp. 1404.</P>
<P>  Defendants granted summary judgment on plaintiff’s procedural and substantive due process claims, where plaintiff contended that testing of Hawaiian terms and the lack of notice thereof constituted a violation of a protected liberty interest without due process; first-time applicant for a surveyor's license had no protected property interest in the license.  846 F. Supp. 1411.</P>
<P>  Police officers would have violated plaintiff's due process rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to plaintiff's need in failing to take plaintiff to receive medical care, assuming the facts as plaintiff stated them.  872 F. Supp. 746.</P>
<P>  Neither prison’s grooming standards nor memorandum regarding enforcement of grooming policy created a protected liberty interest; enforcement of grooming standards did not impose sufficiently "atypical or significant hardship" to justify due process protection.  902 F. Supp. 1220.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff's due process claims against state hospital superintendent, registered nurse, and paramedical assistant, based on defendants' use of force, barred as to superintendent and nurse in their individual capacities by doctrine of qualified immunity.  909 F. Supp. 737.</P>
<P>  Correctional facility's law library access policy was reasonable, provided meaningful access to the courts, and did not violate the Constitution.  938 F. Supp. 650.</P>
<P>  Section 353<B>-</B>14 (1987) provided Hawai`i paroling authority board [sic] with complete discretion to assess inmates' needs and to award "gate money" as necessary in light of those needs; thus, no protected property interest existed.  The right to "gate money" not so fundamental as to warrant constitutional protection apart from its status under state law.  940 F. Supp. 1523.</P>
<P>  Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction denied, where defendant based in California had taken action in Hawaii whereby it purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, facts established a prima facie case that but for defendant's activities in Hawaii, plaintiffs' claims would never have arisen, and defendant had not presented any argument that factors rendered jurisdiction unreasonable (court found factors favored exercise of personal jurisdiction).  980 F. Supp. 1134.</P>
<P>  Elements for specific jurisdiction, discussed, where defendants filed motion to dismiss complaint based on court's lack of personal jurisdiction in case containing causes of action sounding in both tort and contract.  980 F. Supp. 1362.</P>
<P>  Where the court construed allegations of plaintiff (who previously held a position at correctional facility), to, at most, state a claim for negligence on the part of correctional facility officials in failing to provide plaintiff with a personal security guard, even in accepting these allegations as true, plaintiff failed to state a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983.  25 F. Supp. 2d 1124.</P>
<P>  Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim granted, where, inter alia, it appeared plaintiff was asserting a federal constitutional right to be free from bad faith prosecution.  45 F. Supp. 2d 794.</P>
<P>  Section 3(c) of Act 257, [L 1997,] (<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">&#39;</FONT>
486H-10.4(c)), failed to substantially advance a legitimate state interest, and as such, effected an unconstitutional taking in violation of Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; plaintiff's facial regulatory taking claim was ripe.  57 F. Supp. 2d 1003.</P>
<P>  Statute may be so vague as to violate due process.  43 H. 66.</P>
<P>  Ordinance prohibiting use of streets for soliciting sales does not violate due process clause.  43 H. 71.</P>

<P>  Generally speaking, public employment does not create property rights subject to the protection of due process.  48 H. 370, 405 P.2d 772.</P>
<P>  Criminal statute must be sufficiently definite, but only a reasonable degree of certainty is required.  49 H. 624, 636<B>-</B>38, 425 P.2d 1014.</P>
<P>  Penal sanctions, effect on requirement of legislative standards for administrative agencies in adoption of regulations.  49 H. 651, 657<B>-</B>58, 426 P.2d 626.</P>
<P>  Regulation of signs for aesthetic reasons not a denial of due process.  50 H. 33, 429 P.2d 825.</P>

<P>  An ordinance proscribing "presence" at a cockfight is too vague to satisfy requirement of due process.  50 H. 384, 441 P.2d 333.</P>
<P>  Law providing for service of summons on nonresident motorist by publication does not violate due process clause.  50 H. 484, 443 P.2d 155.</P>
<P>  Trial by jury composed only of jurors meeting three-year residence qualification not denial of due process.  51 H. 195, 456 P.2d 805.</P>
<P>  Notice by publication provided by HRS §531<B>-</B>14 was constitutionally insufficient by itself and should have been supplemented by notice by mail or personal service.  52 H. 145, 472 P.2d 494.</P>
<P>  Public employees seeking accidental disability retirement benefits are entitled to hearing on contested issues before board of trustees.  52 H. 212, 473 P.2d 866.</P>

<P>  Defendant in criminal proceedings is entitled to fair hearing on objections to appointed counsel.  52 H. 484, 479 P.2d 207.</P>

<P>  Law making presence in barricaded place a crime, was too vague and overly broad.  52 H. 604, 483 P.2d 997.</P>
<P>  Law together with other sections of Part II, Chapter 709, was invalid for failing to require proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  53 H. 40, 487 P.2d 283.</P>
<P>  Right of accused to be convicted only upon proof by prosecution of all elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt is constitutionally protected.  53 H. 110, 488 P.2d 322.</P>
<P>  Prejudicial conduct of prosecutor in presenting case to grand jury violates due process.  53 H. 226, 491 P.2d 1089.</P>
<P>  Admitting evidence of prior convictions to impeach criminal defendant's credibility imposes unreasonable burden on defendant's right to testify; HRS §621<B>-</B>22 unconstitutional.  53 H. 254, 492 P.2d 657.</P>

<P>  Defendant’s constitutional and statutory right to testify in defendant’s own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow defendant’s attorney’s advice and thus refrain from testifying, and the violation was plain error; denial of the right to testify was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>
<P>  Motions court’s order denying defendant’s pre-trial motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay affirmed, where, inter alia, motions court was correct in concluding that defendant failed to establish that defendant’s claimed inability to recollect events prior to defendant’s indictment, even with the aid of others, amounted to substantial prejudice to defendant’s right to a fair trial.  79 H. 165 (App.), 880 P.2d 217.</P>

<P>  As no Hawaii statute governing parole requires a parolee’s parole to be automatically revoked upon the parolee’s conviction and sentence to imprisonment for a crime committed while on parole, and §353-62 appears to vest Hawaii paroling authority with discretion to revoke parole, parolee’s right violated when authority summarily revoked parole without giving parolee a final revocation hearing.  88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162.</P>
