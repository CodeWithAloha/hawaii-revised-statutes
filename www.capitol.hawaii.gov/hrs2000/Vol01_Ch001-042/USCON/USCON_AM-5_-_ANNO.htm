<P>  Indictment not affected by noncompliance with statutory or criminal rule provisions relating to preliminary examination.  45 H. 604, 372 P.2d 356.</P>
<P>  Preliminary hearing is not a constitutional requirement and not a prerequisite to issuance of indictment.  51 H. 318, 459 P.2d 376.</P>
<P>  Prosecutorial misconduct before grand jury must be extreme and clearly infringe upon jury's decision-making function in order to serve as basis for quashing indictment.  62 H. 209, 614 P.2d 373.</P>
<P>  Hearsay admissible if not deliberately used in place of better evidence to improve case for indictment.  62 H. 518, 616 P.2d 1383.</P>
<P>  Prosecutor was not required to instruct grand jury on option to indict for lesser offense unless evidence clearly establish lesser offense.  62 H. 518, 616 P.2d 1383.</P>

<P>  Evidence established probable cause that defendant was driving under influence of drugs.  68 H. 184, 706 P.2d 1305.</P>
<P>  Section 485-21 provides an essential element of offense charged, when a defendant is charged with a criminal violation of Uniform Securities Act; counts of indictment, which cited to §485-21, were insufficient, as counts did not include essential elements of offenses charged.  78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70.</P>

<B><P>Defendant's out-of-court statements.</P>
</B><P>  Exclusionary rule not applicable where Miranda rights violated by foreign police in foreign country even though in violation of foreign law.  783 F.2d 1052.</P>
<P>  Defendant's second statement was voluntary even though it followed a previous unwarned admission.  889 F.2d 819.</P>

<P>  Doctrine of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, inapplicable to defendant tried before that case decided.  49 H. 522, 532, 423 P.2d 438.  Where Miranda inapplicable, question is whether confession was given "freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences."  50 H. 42, 430 P.2d 330.</P>
<P>  Confession obtained while defendant in custody after being retaken following an escape not voluntary when defendant previously had been found by a psychiatric commission to be suffering from a major mental illness, and upon consideration of other circumstances.  50 H. 42, 430 P.2d 330.</P>
<P>  Waiver of constitutional protection.  51 H. 260, 457 P.2d 505.</P>
<P>  In application of Miranda, the test is whether the words used give a clear, understandable warning of accused's rights.  56 H. 428, 539 P.2d 1200.</P>
<P>  Miranda applies only to custodial interrogation.  58 H. 94, 564 P.2d 1271; 61 H. 124, 596 P.2d 777.</P>
<P>  Voluntary statement that didn't result from custodial interrogation is not restricted by Miranda.  58 H. 323, 568 P.2d 1200; 66 H. 499, 666 P.2d 592.</P>
<P>  Custodial interrogation.  59 H. 357, 581 P.2d 752; 64 H. 479, 643 P.2d 541; 67 H. 126, 681 P.2d 553.</P>
<P>  Without Miranda warnings, statements made during custodial interrogation must be excluded although they may be wholly voluntary; volunteered confession independent of interrogation is outside of Miranda rule.  61 H. 356, 604 P.2d 45.</P>
<P>  Defendant not entitled to Miranda warnings before being questioned by probation officer.  61 H. 571, 606 P.2d 1332.</P>
<P>  Circumstances indicate that interrogation was not custodial interrogation.  62 H. 259, 614 P.2d 386; 2 H. App. 462, 634 P.2d 421.</P>
<P>  Roadside questioning to obtain information to issue traffic citation not a "custodial interrogation".  68 H. 184, 706 P.2d 1305.</P>
<P>  Miranda rights violated where defendant was questioned after polygraph examination.  70 H. 351, 772 P.2d 113.</P>

<P>  Right to remain silent waived where defendant, after being properly given Miranda warnings and additionally being told that everything defendant said was "on the record", initiated dialogue with officer.  80 H. 439, 911 P.2d 74.</P>
<P>  Defendant's response to police matron's question during strip search was inadmissible, absent Miranda warnings.  1 H. App. 430, 620 P.2d 263.</P>
<P>  Validity of waiver of rights; standard of review.  1 H. App. 625, 623 P.2d 1271.</P>
<P>  No right to suppress unsolicited, spontaneous, and voluntary statements made while in custody.  3 H. App. 107, 643 P.2d 807.</P>
<P>  Confession not tainted by earlier confession which had been obtained illegally.  4 H. App. 248, 665 P.2d 181.</P>
<P>  Question to defendant "do you know why you are being detained?" was interrogation because officer should have known that it was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from defendant.  85 H. 171 (App.), 938 P.2d 1190.</P>

<B><P>Self-incrimination.</P>
</B><P>  See also notes on defendant's out-of-court statements.</P>
<P>  State involuntary commitment statute does not violate privilege by penalizing refusal to speak.  617 F.2d 173.</P>
<P>  Prior silence cannot be used for impeachment where silence not probative and where prejudice to defendant might result.  639 F.2d 466.</P>
<P>  No abuse of discretion in allowing witness broad privilege to refuse to answer all substantive questions.  646 F.2d 365.</P>
<P>  Prosecutor's comments not improper comment upon defendant's failure to testify.  730 F.2d 1292.</P>
<P>  Not violated by requirement that passenger notify carrier of firearm shipment.  777 F.2d 494.</P>
<P>  Prosecutor improperly commented on defendant's failure to testify.  807 F.2d 805.</P>
<P>  Defendant's exercise of right to appeal or privilege against self-incrimination cannot be used as basis for denying reduction of offense level under sentencing guidelines for acceptance of responsibility.  998 F.2d 1460.</P>
<P>  Where defendant contended that pursuant to constitutional right to testify, district court was required to permit defendant to explain to jury that defendant behaved in manner that defendant did because defendant was acting under duress, whether or not defendant had demonstrated prima facie evidence of duress, since proposed testimony pertained to a defense that was not relevant as a matter of law, the district court did not err in excluding the evidence during the trial.  102 F.3d 994.</P>
<P>  Requiring inmates labeled as sex offenders to admit their offenses and take responsibility for their sexual behaviors as part of treatment program did not violate privilege against self-incrimination.  131 F.3d 818.</P>
<P>  Prosecutor's prejudicial references to defendant's privilege against self-incrimination made during grand jury hearing are grounds for dismissal of indictment.  450 F. Supp. 1097.</P>
<P>  Prosecutor's comments in regard to defendant's failure to testify were prejudicial.  674 F. Supp. 788.</P>
<P>  Where after never asserting the privilege, petitioner argued that petitioner failed to file a bond and contest the administrative forfeiture because the acts would incriminate petitioner, because the self-incrimination dilemmas never materialized and the remedy sought was well beyond those provided for such dilemmas, petitioner’s argument concerning self-incrimination found without merit.  887 F. Supp. 1371.</P>
<P>  Defendant was not in custody for either of two conversations, where defendant had freedom to move anywhere on island when both conversations occurred; consequently, Miranda warnings not required and defendant's right not to incriminate defendant not violated.  961 F. Supp. 1398.</P>
<P>  Claim of privilege against self-incrimination by minor under 18 cannot be supported on the basis of possible juvenile court proceedings against minor, nor on the basis of possible prosecution for misdemeanor where the statute of limitations will run before the minor reaches 18.  44 H. 271, 353 P.2d 631.</P>
<P>  Right against self-incrimination being personal to witness, defendants cannot object to court's failure to warn witness.  51 H. 40, 450 P.2d 996.</P>
<P>  Comment on defendant's assertion of right against self-incrimination in civil proceeding is not permissible.  51 H. 649, 466 P.2d 452.</P>
<P>  Statute cannot destroy one's right to silence by empowering police and judiciary to compel communication, nor may statute impose criminal liability for failing to speak.  52 H. 527, 480 P.2d 148.</P>
<P>  Comment on defendant's silence not automatic grounds for reversal.  Standard.  63 H. 488, 630 P.2d 619.</P>
<P>  Not violated by requirement to undergo field sobriety test. Roadside questioning of defendant after stop for traffic violation not a custodial interrogation.  67 H. 293, 687 P.2d 544.</P>
<P>  Officer's remarks intended as greeting, not an interrogation.  Confession was unsolicited, spontaneous statement.  67 H. 563, 698 P.2d 281.</P>
<P>  Presentation to defendant of apparently overwhelming inculpatory evidence was an interrogation; right to remain silent violated where functional equivalent of interrogation begun immediately after right exercised.  68 H. 28, 702 P.2d 1352.</P>
<P>  Privilege does not extend to defendant implicated by another whose right against self-incrimination was violated.  68 H. 569, 722 P.2d 1036.</P>
<P>  Default judgment for failure to make an accounting did not violate privilege where no evidence that information sought by accounting would incriminate defendant.  68 H. 608, 726 P.2d 254.</P>
<P>  Miranda warnings for one offense provide sufficient notice as to potential criminal liability for another offense.  69 H. 398, 744 P.2d 514.</P>
<P>  Scope of protections guaranteed by Hawaii constitution are broader than federal requirements.  69 H. 461, 748 P.2d 365.</P>
<P>  Defendant's statement to police, made while wearing blanket during custodial interrogation, was not coerced under totality of circumstances.  72 H. 327, 817 P.2d 1054.</P>
<P>  Constitutional right was not voluntarily waived by defendant's confession to theft where waiver was predicated on prior illegal search and State failed to meet burden of showing that taint of illegal search had been dissipated or that there was an independent source inducing defendant to waive right.  72 H. 505, 824 P.2d 833.</P>
<P>  Not violated where court requested defendant to identify self for purposes of identification in compliance with Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure 43(a) (requiring presence of defendant at trial).  72 H. 573, 827 P.2d 648.</P>
<P>  Defendant’s mental and physical condition at time of defendant’s interview with detective did not render defendant’s statement involuntary; where defendant complained detective repeatedly exhorted defendant to tell the whole story and wheedled a confession out of defendant through misrepresentations, detective’s tactics did not amount to mental or psychological coercion, rendering defendant’s consequent statement involuntary and inadmissible.  74 H. 479, 849 P.2d 58.</P>
<P>  Circuit court’s error in failing to expressly state findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to alleged violation of appellant’s right against self-incrimination was harmless error; reversal of appellant’s original conviction was not based on prosecution’s use of illegally obtained confessions and appellant had never alleged that appellant was in any way compelled to testify at first trial.  76 H. 237, 873 P.2d 775.</P>
<P>  Defendant did not invoke right where, after being properly informed of Fifth Amendment rights, record did not support conclusion that defendant did request attorney during first police interview and defendant admitted to failing to request attorney at last two interviews.  83 H. 443, 927 P.2d 844.</P>
<P>  Right voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived where no one threatened defendant to sign police waiver forms or during subsequent interviews, defendant knew defendant could terminate interviews at any time, and defendant was not a "neophyte" to criminal justice system.  83 H. 443, 927 P.2d 844.</P>
<P>  Where Miranda warnings not first given to defendant in custody, defendant's statements to officer regarding device found in defendant's truck and device's purpose were unlawfully obtained and thus inadmissible.  87 H. 71, 951 P.2d 934.</P>
<P>  Where "public safety" exception to Miranda inapplicable to case, statements by defendant subjected to custodial interrogation without Miranda warnings inadmissible in evidence.  87 H. 71, 951 P.2d 934.</P>
<P>  A trial court must pass on a defendant’s attempted withdrawal of the prior waiver of his or her right to testify, tendered before the commencement of closing arguments, pursuant to the "liberal approach", whereas such an attempted withdrawal tendered thereafter is subject to the "manifest injustice" standard.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where defendant did not meet burden of establishing plausible and legitimate reasons for withdrawal of defendant’s prior waiver of defendant’s right to testify, defendant failed to present "fair and just reasons" for defendant’s request to exercise defendant’s right to testify in defendant’s own behalf; thus trial court did not abuse discretion by ruling that it would not reopen case.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where trial court’s denial of defendant’s post-verdict motion for a new trial -- based on defendant’s claim that defendant’s attempt to withdraw defendant’s waiver of right to testify in defendant’s own behalf should have been allowed -- was not "manifestly unjust", no abuse of discretion.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where defendant initiated contact with police for purpose of making a confession and police adequately determined that defendant’s mind was clear and defendant had made a voluntary decision to waive his rights and make a statement, trial court properly determined defendant knowingly and intelligently waived constitutional rights.  92 H. 19, 986 P.2d 306.</P>
<P>  Where no evidence that defendant felt compelled to give statement to police because defendant feared defendant would be beaten, felt dizzy and in pain, and had not slept in four days prior to defendant’s arrest, trial court erred in concluding statement was not voluntarily and freely given.  92 H. 135, 988 P.2d 200.</P>
<P>  Defendant’s constitutional and statutory right to testify in defendant’s own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow defendant’s attorney’s advice and thus refrain from testifying, and the violation was plain error; denial of the right to testify was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>
<P>  Prosecutor's statements not improper comment upon defendant's failure to testify.  3 H. App. 107, 643 P.2d 807.</P>
<P>  Defendant's right to testify in defendant's own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow defendant's attorney's advice and thus refrain from testifying.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>

<B><P>Former jeopardy.</P>
</B><P>  Essence of double jeopardy determination in conspiracy case is whether there is more than one agreement.  681 F.2d 581.</P>
<P>  Convictions for possession of unregistered firearms and possession of firearms by a felon not violative.  682 F.2d 799.</P>
<P>  Due diligence did not require extraordinary search methods at remote site, based on facts known at that time; greater charges not prohibited if government was unable to prosecute at outset because facts were not discovered despite exercise of due diligence.  707 F.2d 1100.</P>
<P>  No jeopardy attached where at pretrial hearing defendant acquitted by trial court by reason of insanity.  794 F.2d 1458.</P>
<P>  Remand for resentencing of an illegal sentence did not constitute double jeopardy.  876 F.2d 734.</P>
<P>  No double jeopardy where government appeals a reversal of defendant's conviction.  910 F.2d 617.</P>
<P>  Increasing sentence of defendant due to firearm possession while in possession of drugs was not double jeopardy.  924 F.2d 800.</P>
<P>  Murder defendant's fourth trial not barred by double jeopardy clause based on contention that prosecutorial misconduct intended to goad defendant into moving for mistrial.  937 F.2d 1409.</P>
<P>  Civil penalty imposed for failure to disclose marijuana pursuant to U.S. customs directive was not punishment for purposes of double jeopardy which would bar subsequent criminal prosecution for knowing possession and importation of marijuana.  940 F.2d 442.</P>
<P>  Double jeopardy claim failed where appellants failed to show that two conspiracies were the same in law and in fact.  995 F.2d 1448.</P>
<P>  Although double jeopardy clause embraces a defendant's right to have bench trial completed by a particular judge, a defendant moving for a mistrial can be retried.  446 F. Supp. 1120.</P>
<P>  When judge declares mistrial sua sponte over defendant's objections, determination whether there was valid reason for ending trial is governed by manifest necessity test.  No manifest necessity to terminate first trial.  528 F. Supp. 833.</P>
<P>  Prosecution not barred because due diligence exception applied.  Due diligence means ordinary rather than extraordinary diligence.  546 F. Supp. 805.</P>
<P>  Uncontested administrative forfeiture did not offend the double jeopardy clause.  Because defendant chose to forego opportunity to contest forfeiture, defendant was not a party to forfeiture proceeding and could not claim an interest in the property; without an interest in the property, defendant could not be said to have been subjected to jeopardy or punished in any way by the administrative forfeiture.  876 F. Supp. 235.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff was subjected to two separate proceedings, i.e., separation proceedings after plaintiff was found not guilty of use of cocaine by military judge in special court martial, question of whether the separation proceedings were sufficiently punitive to implicate double jeopardy was a serious constitutional question, justifying an exception from the exhaustion requirement for the limited purpose of the temporary restraining order and a finding of a serious question on the merits.  877 F. Supp. 508.</P>
<P>  Uncontested administrative forfeiture did not punish petitioner or place petitioner in jeopardy in the sense necessary to trigger double jeopardy clause protection.  887 F. Supp. 1371.</P>
<P>  Trial court's decision to declare mistrial was proper exercise of its discretion; accordingly, even if juror misconduct was not certain to result in reversal, defendants' joint motion to dismiss indictment on double jeopardy grounds must be denied.  951 F. Supp. 928.</P>
<P>  Double jeopardy clause not violated by a retrial, where jury was unable to reach a verdict.  952 F. Supp. 1426.</P>
<P>  Former prosecution bar to subsequent prosecution, when.  52 H. 321, 474 P.2d 704.</P>
<P>  Effects of setting aside former convictions by granting coram nobis and habeas corpus.  52 H. 420, 477 P.2d 630.</P>
<P>  Declaration of mistrial--when a bar to retrial.  58 H. 377, 569 P.2d 900; 62 H. 108, 612 P.2d 107.</P>
<P>  Resentencing to correct illegal sentence does not violate double jeopardy clause even if correction increases sentence.  61 H. 226, 602 P.2d 13; 67 H. 531, 696 P.2d 344.</P>
<P>  Where first indictment was void, no jury was impanelled, and judge heard no evidence on the charge, jeopardy did not attach.  62 H. 364, 616 P.2d 193.</P>
<P>  Under circumstances, jeopardy did not attach even though jury was sworn.  64 H. 395, 641 P.2d 1338.</P>
<P>  Rights waived by defendant.  64 H. 611, 645 P.2d 1340.</P>
<P>  Dismissal of prosecution not required.  65 H. 47, 647 P.2d 705; 65 H. 129, 648 P.2d 192.</P>
<P>  No jeopardy attached where at pretrial hearing defendant acquitted by trial court by reason of insanity.  67 H. 70, 679 P.2d 615.</P>
<P>  Jeopardy did not attach where case dismissed after defendant arraigned but before State's first witness sworn.  68 H. 238, 709 P.2d 607.</P>
<P>  No double jeopardy where crimes charged involved different mens rea requirements and different facts proved each crime.  68 H. 280, 711 P.2d 731.</P>
<P>  No double jeopardy where trial court did not accept verdict or discharge the jury.  70 H. 175, 765 P.2d 1091.</P>
<P>  Retrial not barred by double jeopardy clause where there was no prosecutorial intent to goad defendant into moving for mistrial.  73 H. 289, 834 P.2d 275.</P>
<P>  Reprosecution barred because defendant was subjected to former jeopardy in first trial and trial court erroneously declared mistrial without defendant’s consent or a showing of manifest necessity.  75 H. 195, 857 P.2d 585.</P>
