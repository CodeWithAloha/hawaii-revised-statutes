<P>  L 2000, c 115, §4 provides:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Deferred acceptance of guilty plea constitutes a form of punishment under the Assimilated Crimes Act.  866 F.2d 315.</P>
<P>  Procedure (under earlier program) does not impose an impermissible burden on exercise of right of trial by jury.  58 H. 304, 568 P.2d 1194.</P>
<P>  Under procedures established before enactment of this section, it was held that a motion for DAG plea was not seasonably made after a plea of not guilty and a trial resulting in a finding of guilt.  58 H. 412, 570 P.2d 1323.</P>
<P>  Denial of motion for DAGP is within discretion of trial court.  59 H. 562, 584 P.2d 126.</P>
<P>  DAG plea is not a conviction and may not be used for impeachment purposes.  62 H. 259, 614 P.2d 386.</P>
<P>  Did not limit trial court's power to accept nolo contendere plea to cases where plea is entered before trial begins.  66 H. 364, 662 P.2d 212.</P>
<P>  Deferred acceptance of guilty and no contest pleas are not appealable.  69 H. 438, 746 P.2d 568.</P>
<P>  Granting or denial of motion for DAG plea is within discretion of trial court and will not be disturbed unless there has been manifest abuse.  1 H. App. 157, 616 P.2d 227.</P>
<P>  This chapter does not prohibit trial court's inherent power to grant or deny deferred acceptance of nolo contendere pleas.  1 H. App. 602, 623 P.2d 892.</P>
<P>  Subsection (a)(1)’s requirement that defendant plead guilty "prior to commencement of trial" means that it be done prior to commencement of first trial; defendant’s plea of guilty after first trial and before new trial did not satisfy that requirement.  10 H. App. 31, 859 P.2d 1380.</P>
<P>  Mentioned:  74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776; 10 H. App. 148, 861 P.2d 759.</P>
