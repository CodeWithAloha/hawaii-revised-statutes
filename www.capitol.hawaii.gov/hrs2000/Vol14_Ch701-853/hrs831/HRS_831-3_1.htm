<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§831-3.1  Prior convictions; criminal records; noncriminal standards.</B>  (a)  A person shall not be disqualified from public office or employment by the State or any of its political subdivisions or agencies except under section 831-2(c), or be disqualified to practice, pursue, or engage in any occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business for which a permit, license, registration, or certificate is required by the State or any of its political subdivisions or agencies, solely by reason of a prior conviction of a crime; provided that with respect to liquor licenses, a person who has been convicted of a felony may be denied a liquor license by the liquor commission.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The following criminal records shall not be used, distributed, or disseminated by the State or any of its political subdivisions or agencies in connection with an application for any said employment, permit, license, registration, or certificate:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Records of arrest not followed by a valid conviction;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Convictions which have been annulled or expunged;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Convictions of a penal offense for which no jail sentence may be imposed;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Conviction of a misdemeanor in which the period of twenty years has elapsed since date of conviction and during which elapsed time there has not been any subsequent arrest or conviction.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;Except as provided in paragraphs (1) to (4), the State or any of its political subdivisions or agencies may consider as a possible justification for the refusal, suspension, or revocation of any employment or of any permit, license, registration, or certificate, any conviction of a penal offense when such offense directly relates (i) to the applicant's possible performance in the job applied for, or (ii) to the employee's possible performance in the job which the employee holds, or (iii) to the applicant's or holder's possible performance in the occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business for which a permit, license, registration, or certificate is applied for or held.</P>
<P>&#9;For the purpose of this subsection, such refusal, suspension, or revocation may occur only when the agency determines, after investigation in accordance with chapter 91, or in the case of employment in the civil service, after appropriate investigation, notification of results and planned action, and opportunity to meet and rebut the finding, all of which need not be conducted in accordance with chapter 91, that the person so convicted has not been sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant the public trust; provided that discharge from probation or parole supervision, or a period of two years after final discharge or release from any term of imprisonment, without subsequent criminal conviction, may be considered as one of many factors to determine sufficiency of rehabilitation.  A person deemed ineligible for employment in the civil service shall be entitled to appeal any and all adverse decisions to the civil service commission within twenty days after the notice of action has been sent to the person.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  When considering noncriminal standards such as good moral character, temperate habits, habitual intemperate use of intoxicants, trustworthiness, and the like, in the granting, renewal, suspension, or revocation of any employment or any such permit, license, registration, or certificate, the agency shall not take into consideration the conviction of any crime except as provided by subsection (b).  Nothing in this section shall be construed to otherwise affect a proceeding before any agency which does not involve the conviction of a crime.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  This section shall not apply to:</P><DIR>
