<P>  Suppression of Evidence Without the Aid of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments.  8 HBJ 109.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Plain language of this section requires police to expressly demand entrance when doors to a place to be searched are shut before attempting forcible entry.  85 H. 282, 943 P.2d 908.</P>
<P>  Compliance with "knock and announce" requirement of this section at outer door of residence before entering was sufficient, and once inside, officers were not required to comply again before entering defendant’s closed bedroom; officers have the discretion to "knock and announce" on inner doors once they have entered a building.  90 H. 16, 975 P.2d 773.</P>
<P>  Section violates Hawai`i constitution to the extent that it permits the police to break into the place to be searched if "bars" to their entrance are not immediately opened; section requires that before attempting forcible entry, police must specifically "demand entrance".  77 H. 461 (App.), 887 P.2d 671.</P>
<P>  While "a reasonable period of time to respond ... must be determined by the circumstances of each case", generally, three to five seconds would not afford the occupants "a reasonable time to respond".  79 H. 185 (App.), 900 P.2d 182.</P>
<P>  Recovery of contraband in execution of prior search warrant is not an exigency of, and does not justify immediate forcible entry in, execution of a subsequent search warrant for the same premises.  79 H. 185 (App.), 900 P.2d 182.</P>
<P>  See 3 H. 393.</P>
