<P>  Act 292, Session Laws 1992, created the offense of harassment by stalking to strengthen the laws against harassment.  A person commits this offense if, with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person, or in reckless disregard of the risk thereof, a person pursues or conducts surveillance upon another without legitimate purpose and under circumstances which would cause the other to reasonably believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury or property damage.
