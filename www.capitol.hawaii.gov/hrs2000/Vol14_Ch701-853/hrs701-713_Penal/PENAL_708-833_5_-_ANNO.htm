</B>
<P>  Act 202, Session Laws 1979, established this section to provide minimum mandatory fines for shoplifting offenses, but has retained the alternative of paying fines through court ordered public service work.  The Legislature believed the public service work alternative preferable to the establishment of a "debtor's prison".  Conference Committee Report No. 72.</P>
<P>  Act 233, Session Laws 1982, doubled the fines on persons who repeatedly shoplift.</P>
<P>  Act 314, Session Laws 1986, increased the dollar amounts of the property involved in the offense of shoplifting.  With the increase, the dollar amounts will more accurately reflect current property values and consequently the offense will warrant the level of culpability intended when it was originally drafted.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 820-86.</P>
