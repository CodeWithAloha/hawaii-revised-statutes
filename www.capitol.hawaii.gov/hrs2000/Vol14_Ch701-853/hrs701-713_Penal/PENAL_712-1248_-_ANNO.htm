<P>  Where violation of misdemeanor offense under subsection (1)(d) also constituted violation of felony offense under §712-1247(1)(h), conviction of felony offense would have constituted violation of defendant's due process and equal protection rights.  86 H. 48, 947 P.2d 360.</P>
<P>  Since to sell and to barter do not include to prescribe, §712-1248(1)(d) is not a lesser included offense of §712-1247(1)(h).  78 H. 488 (App.), 896 P.2d 944.</P>
