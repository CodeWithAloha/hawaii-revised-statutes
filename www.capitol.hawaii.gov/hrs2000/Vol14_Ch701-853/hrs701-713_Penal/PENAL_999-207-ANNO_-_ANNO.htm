<P>  This chapter deals with conduct which is designed to culminate in the commission of a substantive offense but which fails to do so.  The failure may be due to apprehension or intervention by law enforcement officials or it may be due to some other miscalculation on the part of the defendant.  In this sense attempt, solicitation, and conspiracy are predominantly inchoate in nature and are grouped in this chapter for a unified and integrated treatment.  While it is true that other offenses, such as reckless endangering, forgery, kidnapping, property damage and burglary, have inchoate aspects, "attempt, solicitation and conspiracy have such generality of definition and of application as inchoate crimes that it is useful to bring them together in the Code and to confront the common problems they present."[1]</P>
