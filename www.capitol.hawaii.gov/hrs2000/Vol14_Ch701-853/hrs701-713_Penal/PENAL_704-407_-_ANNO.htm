</B>
<P>  This section affords the defendant and the defendant's counsel the opportunity, notwithstanding the defendant's unfitness to proceed, to make any objection to the prosecution which is susceptible of a fair determination without the personal participation of the defendant.  It seems clear that this is an eminently sensible provision in view of the fact that it is the defendant's inability to participate in the defendant's defense (either because the defendant lacks capacity to either understand the proceedings or to assist in the defendant's own defense) that has rendered the defendant unfit to be proceeded against.  If a valid objection to the continuance of the prosecution can be established without the participation of the defendant, there is no reason not to terminate it.</P>
<P>  This section is an addition to the law.  The concept was originally proposed by the Massachusetts Judicial Council[1] and adopted as an optional alternative by the Model Penal Code.[2]</P>

</B>
<P>  Act 222, Session Laws 1980, eliminated post-commitment release motions based upon factual grounds and limited such motions to those based upon legal grounds.  The intent was to have all factual issues, including insanity, heard in one trial.</P>
