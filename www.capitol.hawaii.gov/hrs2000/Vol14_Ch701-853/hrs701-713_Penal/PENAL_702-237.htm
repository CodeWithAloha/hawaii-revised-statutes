<DIR>

<P>&#9;(a)&#9;Knowingly made false representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct or result was not prohibited; or</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;Employed methods of persuasion or inducement which created a substantial risk that the offense would be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)  The defense afforded by this section is unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offense charged and the prosecution is based on conduct causing or threatening such injury to a person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment.
