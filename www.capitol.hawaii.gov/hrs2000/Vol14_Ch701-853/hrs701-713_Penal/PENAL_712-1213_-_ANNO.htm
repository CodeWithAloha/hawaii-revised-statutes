<P>  This section is derived from the proposed statute in Richard Kuh's influential book on pornography.[1]  The purpose of the section is to ease the burden on the prosecutor of making a prima facie case on the issue of mens rea in cases involving violation of §712-1211.  It makes proof of a prohibited display prima facie evidence of the requisite state of mind; however, it does not change the prosecutor's ultimate burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>
