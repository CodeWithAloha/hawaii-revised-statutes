</B>
<P>  This section prohibits any sort of outrageous treatment of a human corpse, including sexual contact (necrophilia) and physical abuse.  It does not, of course, relate to legally authorized activities of undertakers and physicians.  Knowledge that ordinary family sensibilities would be outraged must be proved. </P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law prohibited the disinterment, disturbance, or scattering of any human body that has been legally interred.[1]  Section 711-1108 is more comprehensive in coverage. </P>
