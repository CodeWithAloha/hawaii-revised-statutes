</B>
<P>  This section substantially adopts the Model Penal Code rules on justification of the use of force in self-protection.  It has been rewritten and reorganized to make it more easily understandable.</P>
<P>  Subsection (1) requires a belief by the actor that the use of protective force is actually necessary, and that unlawful force (defined in §703-300) is to be used by the assailant.  He must believe, further, that immediate use of force is required, although the threatened harm to him need not be "imminent," as the rule was sometimes phrased at common law.  It is enough that unlawful force is threatened on the present occasion by his assailant.  The actor may make his defensive move without waiting for his assailant to load his gun or to summon reinforcements.  Finally, the actor must believe that the particular degree of force used by him is necessary.  This formulation is not meant to require a precise equation, but it will limit the defense to situations in which a particular scope and degree of retaliation is believed by the actor to be appropriate to the aggression.</P>
<P>  Subsections (2) and (5) strictly limit the use of deadly force.  Under the circumstances specified in subsection (2), the actor may use deadly force if he believes it is necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping, rape, or forcible sodomy.  This formulation has two implications:  (a) the actor must believe that deadly force is the only viable means of preventing the specified harm, and (b) the actor must believe that one of the specified harms is threatened on the present occasion.  "Deadly force" is defined in §703-300.  Its use is further restricted by subsection (5).  Deadly force may not be used if the actor provoked his assailant's use of force against himself in the same encounter with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily injury.  Of course, if he intends only moderate harm and receives a deadly response, the initial aggressor may respond with deadly force.  The use of deadly force is also denied when the actor can avoid using it with complete safety by retreating, by surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right to it, or by complying with a demand that he refrain from taking an action which he has no legal duty to take.  In any of these cases, the Code may seem to be opting for cowardice.  However, it should be the strong principle of any criminal code to prevent death wherever possible.  To quote the Model Penal Code commentary,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It rests, of course, upon the view that protection of life has such a high place in a proper scheme of social values that the law cannot permit conduct which places life in jeopardy, when the necessity for doing so can be avoided by the sacrifice of the much smaller value that inheres in standing up to an aggression.[1]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>  However, a duty to retreat or take over evasive action is not imposed in two situations.  Subsection (5), subparagraph (b)(i), states that the actor is not required to retreat from his dwelling or his place of work unless he was the initial aggressor or unless he is assailed in his place of work by another person whose place of work he knows it to be.  We would not normally expect a man to abandon his home to an aggressor and would allow him to stand his ground, although an exception is made, consistent with paragraph (a), if the actor is the initial aggressor.  The exception for an attack in a man's place of work is new with the Model Penal Code.  The same principles which permit a man to remain in his home would, for example, permit a shopkeeper to defend himself in his place of business without abandoning it to attackers.  Subparagraph (b)(ii), of the same subsection, relates to public officials or persons assisting them using force in the performance of duty.  It would be against public interest to require a public officer to abandon his duty if he meets resistance.  This Code follows the Model Penal Code in extending the justification to all arrests and performances of duty, even if they are technically unlawful.  Throughout Chapter 703 the rule is that resistance to unlawful arrest is to be made in court rather than physically.</P>
<P>  The Code also specifically requires surrendering possession of a thing when the attacker asserts a claim of right thereto.  Where a person offers deadly force unless another surrenders property to him, and claims a right to the property, it is certainly sound policy to save life and litigate the disputed ownership in court.  Naturally, however, this rule does not apply in cases of robbery, where the assailant can make no claim of right, and it is the purpose of the Code to permit deadly resistance to robbery if the conditions of subsection (2) are met.  Finally, deadly force is impermissible if the actor can avoid using it by complying with a demand that he refrain from any action which he has no duty to take.  Again, the policy of saving life seems more insistent than the right of the individual to complete freedom of action.</P>
<P>  Subsection (3) states the generally applicable rule that the actor need not retreat or take any other evasive action before estimating the necessity for the use of force in self-protection.</P>
<P>  Subsection (4) sets general limits on the use of self- protective force.  Paragraph (a) follows the Model Penal Code in forbidding any use of force to resist an arrest which the actor knows is being made by a peace officer.  Resistance to even an unlawful arrest should be made in court.  No valid social policy is served by permitting physical resistance to peace officers who are known as such by the actor.  If the law were to permit physical resistance, it would in effect be sanctioning unnecessary injury.  However, only force for the purpose of resisting an arrest is proscribed.  If the officer threatens to use unlawful force after the arrest, the normal self-protection rules would apply.  In other words, the actor may resist a "peril greater than arrest."[2]  Paragraph (b) is closely related to §703-306 (protection of property) which permits the use of force by the occupier or possessor of property to protect it.  The actor may not use force to counter that permissible force, when it is directed at him under a claim of right to protect the property, unless he is a public officer or a person assisting him or a person making or assisting in a lawful arrest, or unless he believes that he must use force to protect himself against death or serious bodily harm.  A third Model Penal Code exception, dealing with a right of re-entry or recaption, has been omitted.  As explained in the commentary to §703-306, it does not seem wise to deal separately with these matters.  This Code treats them under the more general rules relating to protection of property.</P>
<P>  Subsection (6) recognizes that confinement may be used as protective force.  Because of the continuing nature of confinement, however, the Code requires the actor to terminate the confinement as soon as he knows he can do so safely.  He has no such duty if the person is arrested, simply because the legality of a confinement will then be tested by ordinary judicial processes.</P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii case law required that the defendant's belief be reasonable.[3]  Contrary to subsection (3) of the Code, under the Hawaii cases, the defendant must retreat before he uses any force, except in those circumstances where deadly force is the only way serious felonies against persons can be prevented.[4]  In the latter situations, it appears that Hawaii case law, like the Code, would require retreat if it could be accomplished with complete safety.[5]  To the extent that Hawaii cases demand "imminent" danger, in the common law sense,[6] the Code represents a change in the law.  Finally, the subsection on confinement is an addition to Hawaii law.</P>
