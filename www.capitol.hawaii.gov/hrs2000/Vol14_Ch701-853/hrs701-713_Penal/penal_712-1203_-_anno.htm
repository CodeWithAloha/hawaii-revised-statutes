<P>  Section 701-109(1)(d) prohibits conviction under both this section and §842-2(2), as both this section and §842-2(2) seek to redress the same conduct -– the control of an enterprise involved in criminal activity.  In such case, this section, the specific statute, governs over the general statute, §842-2(2).  88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227.</P>
