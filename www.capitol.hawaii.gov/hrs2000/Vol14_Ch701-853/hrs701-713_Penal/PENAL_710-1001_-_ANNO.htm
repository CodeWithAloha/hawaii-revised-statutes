</B>
<P>  This section is derived from the previous law on the forfeiture of bribery money.[1]  Since this chapter deals with additional kindred offenses, e.g., compounding, giving and receiving unlawful compensation, giving and receiving improper gifts, unlawful assistance of a private interest, and obtaining unlawful assistance of a public servant, the forfeiture is expressed in general terms to cover all sections in which property is offered, conferred, agreed to be conferred, or accepted as a benefit, pecuniary benefit, or compensation in the commission of an offense defined in this chapter.  The mere solicitation or agreement to accept property would not, of course, work a forfeiture.</P>
<P>  The forfeiture is specifically made subject to the requirements of §701-119 which embodies a single procedure for the establishment of all forfeitures declared by the Penal Code.  The procedure provides, as did the previous law,[2] for the protection of innocent owners of property which is involved in the commission of an offense.</P>
