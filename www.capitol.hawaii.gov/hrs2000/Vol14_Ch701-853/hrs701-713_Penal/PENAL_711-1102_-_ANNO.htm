</B>
<P>  This section provides a procedure under which a peace officer can order a group of six or more persons participating in a course of disorderly conduct likely to cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to disperse.  A similar order may be made to others in the immediate vicinity.  Failure to obey such an order is a misdemeanor.  The offense is thus an aggravated form of disorderly conduct which does not reach the point of riot or unlawful assembly. </P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law contained a somewhat similar section, allowing an order to disperse after "force or violence has been used disturbing the public peace."[1] </P>
