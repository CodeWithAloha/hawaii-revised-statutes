<P>  Defendant's attempt to obtain plaintiff's property was made under claim of [sic] right.  855 F. Supp. 1156.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENTARY ON §§707-764 TO 769</P>
</B>
<P>  Act 106, Session Laws 1979, established these sections as part of a consolidation of laws pertaining to extortion wherein the Legislature sought to make those laws simpler and more comprehensive.  The Legislature rejected a provision making acts which caused the victim "great mental anguish" extortion in the first degree on the grounds that such a standard is too subjective, and would differ from one individual to the next.  Conference Committee Report No. 43.</P>
<P>  Act 28, Session Laws 1993, amended §707-766 by stating the elements of the offense of extortion in the second degree in the disjunctive, consistent with the intent of the 1979 legislature in enacting that section, and by making the language of that section gender neutral.  House Standing Committee Report No. 190, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1121.</P>
<P>  Act 383, Session Laws 1997, amended §707-769 to provide a defense to prosecution for extortion to reciprocal beneficiaries.  In establishing the status of reciprocal beneficiaries, the Act provides certain rights and benefits, and represents a commitment to provide substantially similar government rights to those couples who are barred by law from marriage.  Conference Committee Report No. 2.</P>
