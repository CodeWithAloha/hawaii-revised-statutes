<P>  It seems clear that, in dealing with corporate penal liability, government corporations must be exempt.  Penal liability in such a case is pointless.</P>
<P>  The phrases "agent" and "high managerial agent" are broadly and inclusively defined.  Given the wide variety of employment and other agency relationships, the definitions must present criteria which are very general.  Further refinement or elaboration should be left to a case-by-case determination.</P>
