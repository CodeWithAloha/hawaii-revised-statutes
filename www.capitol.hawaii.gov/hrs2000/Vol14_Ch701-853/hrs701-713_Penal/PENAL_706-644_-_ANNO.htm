</B>
<P>  The Code equates a fine with a court-imposed civil obligation in favor of the State.  Thus the contempt power is utilized to enforce that obligation.  Subsection (1) provides that the court may summon the defendant, or issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest, and order the defendant to show cause why the defendant's failure to pay the fine should not be regarded by the court as contumacious.  If the defendant cannot, the defendant will be imprisoned as in the cases of civil contempt.</P>
<P>  In the case of convicted corporations or unincorporated associations, subsection (2) places a similar duty to pay, or to justify default of payment, on the officer or agent of a corporation or unincorporated association authorized to distribute its assets.</P>
<P>  Subsection (3) sets the limit on the period of imprisonment for contumacious nonpayment of fines.  The terms are intended to be coercive, but not debilitating.  The credit allowed is the same as that under previous law.[1]</P>
<P>  Subsection (4) permits the court to take a flexible approach to noncontumacious default.  The court may lower the amount of each payment or may revoke the fine in whole or in part.</P>
<P>  Subsection (5) makes clear that all the processes for collection of an unpaid civil judgment are available for collection of a fine.  This subsection is in accord with prior law.[2]</P>

<P>  Act 137, Session Laws 1996, amended this section to provide that fines and costs may be collected in the same manner as a civil judgment, and that the state attorney general may institute proceedings to collect the fine and costs, including interest and attorney's fees, as a civil judgment in the court of appropriate jurisdiction.  The legislature found that the Act (which also amended the traffic code by enacting a new section with similar provisions) would assist the judiciary in collecting fines and costs imposed in traffic and criminal cases.  The Act also deleted the first sentence of subsection (5) to remove potential conflict between existing law and the provisions of the Act.  House Standing Committee Report No. 379-96, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2987.</P>
<P>  Act 269, Session Laws 1998, amended this section by, among other things, allowing victims of crime to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil judgment.  Conference Committee Report No. 89.</P>
<P>  Act 205, Session Laws 2000, amended this section by adding that the nonpayment of any fees, in addition to the nonpayment of any fine or restitution ordered by a court, would be subject to the penalties and consequences imposed under this section.</P>
