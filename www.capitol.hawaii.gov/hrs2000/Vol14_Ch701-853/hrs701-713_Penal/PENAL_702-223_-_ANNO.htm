</B>
<P>  This section is intended to make clear that a defendant charged, on the basis of the defendant's complicity in the conduct of another, with causing a particular result will not be allowed to escape accountability for the result because the defendant solicited or aided, etc., a different or more limited result if the defendant had the requisite state of mind with respect to the actual result.</P>
<P>  Thus, for example, one who urges a driver to increase the speed of an automobile, disregarding known risks to pedestrians, would stand in the same position as the driver on a charge of reckless homicide and would not be allowed to defend on the ground that one solicited the violation of the traffic law and not the homicide law.</P>
