</B>
<P>  Act 12, Session Laws 1993, added this section to establish the offense of unlawful entry upon the premises of a facility used as a sex, child, or spouse abuse shelter, by making it a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly enter or unlawfully remain upon the premises after reasonable warning or request to leave by a facility staff member.  Since the locations of these shelters are often known, individuals seeking shelter and shelter staff are at potential risk from abusers.  This section affords a higher level of legal protection for staff and persons who seek refuge from abuse.  House Standing Committee Report No. 692, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1049.</P>
