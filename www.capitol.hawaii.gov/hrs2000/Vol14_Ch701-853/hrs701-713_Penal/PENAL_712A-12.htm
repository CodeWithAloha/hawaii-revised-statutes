<P>&#9;(6)  The hearing on the claim, to the extent practicable and consistent with the interest of justice, shall be held within sixty days after the filing of the petition.  The court may consolidate the hearing on the claim with a hearing on any other claim concerning the same property.</P>
<P>&#9;(7)  At the hearing, the claimant may testify, present evidence and witnesses on the claimant's behalf, and cross- examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.  The State may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of its claim to the property and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.</P>
<P>&#9;(8)  The State has the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant's interest in the property is subject to forfeiture.  On such a showing by the State, the claimant has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant's interest in the property is not subject to forfeiture.</P>
<P>&#9;(9)  In accordance with its findings at the hearing, the court shall order an interest in property returned or conveyed to the claimant, if any, who has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant's interest is not subject to forfeiture.
