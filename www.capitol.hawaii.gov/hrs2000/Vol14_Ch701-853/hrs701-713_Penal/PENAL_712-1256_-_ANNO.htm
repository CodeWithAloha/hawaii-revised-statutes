</B>
<P>  Section 712-1253 assures that the penalty provisions of this part as well as of Chapter 329, HRS will not be in lieu of any civil penalties.  This is an addition to the proposed draft. </P>
<P>  Section 712-1254 is a double jeopardy provision which represents an addition to the proposed draft. </P>
<P>  Section 712-1255 is concerned with the conditional discharge of first offenders.  If a first offender is guilty of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, or promoting a harmful drug in the second or third degrees, or promoting a detrimental drug in the second or third degrees, or promoting intoxicating compounds, the first offender qualifies for a conditional discharge. </P>
<P>  If the defendant is under 20 years old, §712-1256 provides that the court records may be expunged upon application.  The Code recognizes that many offenders may be young persons who are otherwise without criminal records.  The Code attempts to assure proper sanctions, while at the same time allowing for moderation of punishment and sentencing of first offenders. </P>
