<P>  Selection of jurors under earlier amendments.  17 H. 23; 18 H. 46; 22 H. 618.</P>
<P>  Grand jury not incompetent through omission to apportion list of persons from different precincts.  29 H. 7.  The mere fact that the trial jurors drawn from the jury list did not contain percentages of persons of nativity of the citizenry in the court's jurisdiction did not show that the list itself violated the jury statute.  118 F.2d 667.  Violation occurs if there is systematic or arbitrary exclusion of or discrimination between persons of a particular race.  Id.  Evidence disclosing that the employer entrepreneur group comprised but about 3.6% of the population of the county but comprised 42% of the grand jury list and that male laborers comprised approximately 79% of male population of county but 12% of grand jury list established that an erroneous method had been employed in selecting the grand jury list.  82 F. Supp. 65, 117, reversed on other grounds.  187 F.2d 860.  Denial of plea in bar and motion to dismiss indictment upon ground selection was not made without reference to race, place of nativity, or sex was not erroneous.  45 H. 247, 365 P.2d 460.  Proportional representation.  103 F. Supp. 1; 105 F. Supp. 727.</P>
