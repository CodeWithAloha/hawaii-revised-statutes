<P>  Conditional discharge of defendant under section 712-1255 is not a final disposition of the case appealable by the State.  60 H. 576, 592 P.2d 832.</P>
<P>  Stipulation for joint hearing on motion to suppress and trial on merits is not a waiver by State of its right to appeal from ruling on motion to suppress.  62 H. 44, 609 P.2d 131.</P>
<P>  Under circumstances, jeopardy did not attach even though jury was sworn.  64 H. 395, 641 P.2d 1338.</P>
<P>  Jeopardy did not attach where case dismissed after defendant arraigned but before State's first witness sworn.  68 H. 238, 709 P.2d 607.</P>
<P>  State could appeal only under paragraph (2) where case dismissed after all evidence taken.  68 H. 653, 729 P.2d 385.</P>
<P>  Deferred acceptance of guilty and deferred acceptance of no contest pleas are not appealable.  69 H. 438, 746 P.2d 568.</P>
<P>  Authorizes appellate jurisdiction to review orders granting pretrial motions to suppress.  70 H. 206, 767 P.2d 1238.</P>
<P>  Language does not allow an appeal from a sentence on the ground that the sentence was imposed in an illegal manner, but allows an appeal from an illegal sentence.  71 H. 624, 801 P.2d 558.</P>
<P>  State's right to appeal in criminal cases is limited to instances stated in section; section does not give State right to appeal from granting of deferred acceptance of guilty or deferred acceptance of no contest pleas.  74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776.</P>
<P>  While it is necessary for "entire case" to be dismissed for paragraph (2) to apply, there is nothing in the language of this section to indicate that this would prevent paragraph (1) from applying; prosecution not barred from bringing appeal of dismissal of counts of indictment, where counts dismissed after trial began because counts did not include essential elements of offenses charged.  78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70.</P>
<P>  In a jury trial, issues decided by the judge are "questions of law" appealable under this section, while issues decided by the jury are "questions of fact" and are not appealable.  85 H. 462, 946 P.2d 32.</P>
<P>  As defendant's "motion to dismiss" following a jury verdict of guilty deemed post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal following a jury verdict of guilty pursuant to HRPP rule 29(c), paragraph (9) authorized prosecution to assert appeal from this judgment of acquittal; thus, supreme court had appellate jurisdiction over appeal.  87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865.</P>
<P>  Double jeopardy clauses not violated by prosecution's appeal from judgment of acquittal following jury's verdict of guilty pursuant to paragraph (9).  87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865.</P>
<P>  Paragraph (1) permits prosecution to appeal from both dismissals with prejudice and without prejudice.  87 H. 260, 953 P.2d 1358.</P>
<P>  Deferred acceptance of no contest plea not appealable until no contest plea accepted.  5 H. App. 357, 692 P.2d 1171.</P>
<P>  Section is to be strictly construed.  7 H. App. 516, 782 P.2d 29.</P>
<P>  Paragraph (9) did not preclude appellate court’s jurisdiction over State’s appeal where trial court’s judgment of acquittal was "in form only and not in substance"; trial court made no factual determination as to some or all of the elements charged, but grounded its ruling on the conclusion that the charges were defective as a matter of law.  88 H. 477 (App.), 967 P.2d 674.</P>
