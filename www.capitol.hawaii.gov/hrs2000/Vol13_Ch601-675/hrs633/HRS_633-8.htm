The order to show cause shall also provide that, if the leased or rented personal property is not returned to the plaintiff prior to the hearing, the defendant shall, if reasonably feasible, produce the property at the hearing.  If, at the hearing, it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the leased or rented personal property, it shall issue an order directed to the sheriff, or the sheriff's deputy, commanding the sheriff or the sheriff's deputy to seize the personal property therein described and to deliver the same to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's agent.  Service of the order to show cause shall be as provided by law or rule of court for cases in the district courts, or by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt showing delivery within the circuit.
