The insurance commissioner also shall mail copies of the advisory decision to the department of commerce and consumer affairs, if the claim is against a physician or surgeon licensed under chapter 453 or an osteopathic physician and surgeon licensed under chapter 460 or a podiatrist licensed under chapter 463E.  The panel shall decide the issue of liability and shall state its conclusions in substantially the following language:  "We find the health care provider was actionably negligent in his or her care and treatment of the patient and we, therefore, find for the claimant"; or "We find the health care provider was not actionably negligent in his or her care and treatment of the patient and we, therefore, find for the health care provider".</P>
