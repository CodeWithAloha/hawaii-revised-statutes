A computer software or hardware manufacturer or vendor shall be directly liable to a person harmed by a year 2000 error to the same extent that the computer software or hardware manufacturer or vendor would be liable to a person in the absence of the provisions of this chapter.  As used in the section, "computer software or hardware manufacturer or vendor" shall not include the State, its political subdivisions, a board, or a government employee.
