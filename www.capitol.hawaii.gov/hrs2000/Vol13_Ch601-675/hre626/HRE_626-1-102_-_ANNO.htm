</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 102.  It parallels similar provisions in the Hawaii Rules of Court, see HRCrP 2, HRCP 1, and HFCR 1.  Except for Articles III and V, these rules have as their model the Federal Rules of Evidence (Fed. R. Evid.), 28 U.S.C. app., at 539 (1976), as amended, 28 U.S.C.A. Fed. R. Evid. (Supp. 1979).  Accordingly, the commentary to each rule (except in Articles III and V) indicates whether the rule is identical with or differs from the counterpart federal rule.  The intent is to make applicable, as an aid in construction, the federal decisional law construing identical or similar Fed. R. Evid. provisions.  Other sources for these rules, noted from time to time in the commentaries, are the Uniform Rule of Evidence and the Cal. Evid. Code (especially for Article III).</P>
