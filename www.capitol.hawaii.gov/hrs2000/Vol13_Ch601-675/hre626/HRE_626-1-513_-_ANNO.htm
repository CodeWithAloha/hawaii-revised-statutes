<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 513 COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is similar to Uniform Rule of Evidence 512.  The foundation for the rule may be inferred from Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609 (1965), in which the Supreme Court held that adverse judicial comment upon a claim of privilege against self-incrimination impermissibly burdens the privilege itself.  See Tehan v. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 415 (1966).  McCormick agrees that "allowing comment upon the exercise of a privilege or requiring it to be claimed in the presence of the jury tends greatly to diminish its value."  McCormick §76.  McCormick recommends recognizing "only privileges which are soundly based in policy and [according] those privileges the fullest protection [by precluding comment and drawing of inferences]."  Id.  The present rule does just that.</P>
<P>  To the extent that it relates to the privilege against self-incrimination, Hawaii has recognized the "no comment" rule in both prior statute and case law.  Hawaii Rev. Stat. §621-15 (1976) (repealed 1980) (originally enacted as L 1876, c 32, §52) provided, in part:  "[N]o inference shall be drawn prejudicial to the accused by reason of such neglect or refusal [to testify], nor shall any argument be permitted tending to injure the defense of the accused person on account of such failure to offer himself as a witness."</P>
<P>  In The King v. McGiffin, 7 H. 104 (1887), the court noted that the prosecution's comment in its summation upon the failure to the accused to testify was improper, and in Kaneshiro v. Belisario, 51 H. 649, 466 P.2d 452 (1970), the court extended the "no comment" rule to civil as well as criminal proceedings.  The present rule applies to all the privileges established in this article.</P>
<P>  Subsection (c) accords to the party against whom adverse inferences from a claim of privilege might be drawn the option of having the admonitory instruction given to the jury or waiving it.  In State v. Baxter, 51 H. 157, 454 P.2d 366 (1969), the court held that the admonitory instruction could be given even over the objection of the party claiming the privilege, but cautioned that "a trial court may well be advised not to give an admonitory instruction when the [party] objects."  The same result was reached in Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U.S. 333 (1978).  The present rule modifies these holdings by investing in the party exercising the privilege the right "to have no instruction on the matter given to the jury."  The same result was contended for by Justice Abe in his dissent in Baxter, supra.</P>
