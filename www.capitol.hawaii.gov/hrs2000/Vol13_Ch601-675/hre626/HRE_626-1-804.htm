<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>Rule 804  Hearsay exceptions; declarant unavailable.  </B>(a)  Definition of unavailability.  "Unavailability as a witness" includes situations in which the declarant:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement despite an order of the court to do so;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant's statement;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Is absent from the hearing and the proponent of the declarant's statement has been unable to procure the declarant's attendance by process or other reasonable means.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if the declarant's exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of the declarant's statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.  Determination of unavailability as a witness pursuant to this rule does not affect the opponent's right, under rule 806, to call and to cross- examine the declarant concerning the subject matter of any statement received in accordance with this rule.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Hearsay exceptions.  The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Former testimony.  Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, at the instance of or against a party with an opportunity to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination, with motive and interest similar to those of the party against whom now offered;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Statement under belief of impending death.  A statement made by a declarant while believing that the declarant's death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be the declarant's impending death;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Statement against interest.  A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true.  A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Statement of personal or family history.  (A) A statement concerning the declarant's own birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history, even though declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated; or (B) a statement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the other's family as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Statement of recent perception.  A statement, not in response to the instigation of a person engaged in investigating, litigating, or settling a claim, which narrates, describes, or explains an event or condition recently perceived by the declarant, made in good faith, not in contemplation of pending or anticipated litigation in which the declarant was interested, and while the declarant's recollection was clear;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Statement by child.  A statement made by a child when under the age of sixteen, describing any act of sexual contact, sexual penetration, or physical violence performed with or against the child by another, if the court determines that the time, content, and circumstances of the statement provide strong assurances of trustworthiness with regard to appropriate factors that include but are not limited to:  (A) age and mental condition of the declarant; (B) spontaneity and absence of suggestion; (C) appropriateness of the language and terminology of the statement, given the child's age; (D) lack of motive to fabricate; (E) time interval between the event and the statement, and the reasons therefor; and (F) whether or not the statement was recorded, and the time, circumstances, and method of the recording.  If admitted, the statement may be read or, in the event of a recorded statement, broadcast into evidence but may not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Other exceptions.  A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that (A) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts, and (B) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.  However, a statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the proponent's intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.
