<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>Rule 304  Presumptions imposing burden of proof.</B>  (a) General rule.  A presumption established to implement a public policy other than, or in addition to, facilitating the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of proof.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Effect.  The effect of a presumption imposing the burden of proof is to require the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced sufficient to convince the trier of fact of the nonexistence of the presumed fact.  Except as otherwise provided by law or by these rules, proof by a preponderance of the evidence is necessary and sufficient to rebut a presumption established under this rule.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Presumptions.  The following presumptions, and all other presumptions established by law that fall within the criteria of subsection (a) of this rule, are presumptions imposing the burden of proof.</P><DIR>
