<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Scope.  Except as otherwise provided by statute, in criminal proceedings, presumptions against an accused, recognized at common law or created by statute, including statutory provisions that certain facts are prima facie evidence of other facts or of guilt, are governed by this subsection.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Submission to jury.  When a presumed fact establishes an element of the offense or negatives a defense, the court may submit the presumption to the jury only if a reasonable juror on the evidence as a whole, including the evidence of the basic facts, could find the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Instructing the jury.  The court may not direct the jury to find a presumed fact against the accused.  Whenever a presumption against the accused is submitted to the jury, the court shall instruct the jury that, if it finds the basic facts beyond a reasonable doubt, it may infer the presumed fact but is not required to do so.  In addition, if the presumed fact establishes an element of the offense or negatives a defense, the court shall instruct the jury that its existence, on all the evidence, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  Presumptions against the State.  Except as otherwise provided by statute, in criminal proceedings, presumptions against the State, recognized at common law or created by statute, impose on the State either (1) the burden of producing evidence, or (2) the burden of proof.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Inconsistent presumptions.  If two presumptions are mutually inconsistent, the presumption applies that is founded upon weightier considerations of policy and logic.  If considerations of policy and logic are of equal weight, neither presumption applies. [L 1980, c 164, pt of §1]</P>
