The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  Specific instances of conduct.  Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking the witness' credibility, if probative of untruthfulness, may be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness and, in the discretion of the court, may be proved by extrinsic evidence.  When a witness testifies to the character of another witness under subsection (a), relevant specific instances of the other witness' conduct may be inquired into on cross-examination but may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.</P>
<P>&#9;The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by any other witness, does not operate as a waiver of the witness' privilege against self-incrimination when examined with respect to matters which relate only to credibility.
