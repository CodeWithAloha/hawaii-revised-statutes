</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is similar to Fed. R. Evid. 1005 in intent.  The "public records" covered are those specified in Rule 1001(5) supra.  Since production of original public records would be burdensome to both proponents and public officials, numerous statutes, e.g., Hawaii Rev. Stat. §502-82 (1976) (recorded instruments of conveyance) dispense with such a requirement.  In this instance, however, a distinct preference for certified or compared copies is expressed.</P>
