<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Examination by order of court.  If the court orders an examination of the physical, mental, or emotional condition of a patient, whether a party or a witness, communications made in the course thereof are not privileged under this rule with respect to the particular purpose for which the examination is ordered unless the court orders otherwise.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Condition an element of claim or defense.

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Proceedings against physician.  There is no privilege under this rule in any administrative or judicial proceeding in which the competency, practitioner's license, or practice of the physician is at issue, provided that the identifying data of the patients whose records are admitted into evidence shall be kept confidential unless waived by the patient.  The administrative agency, board, or commission may close the proceeding to the public to protect the confidentiality of the patient. [L 1980, c 164, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]</P>
