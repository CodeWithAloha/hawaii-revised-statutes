</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 805.  Because the principal concern in determining the admissibility of hearsay evidence is the assurance of trustworthiness, multiple hearsay creates a multi-level requirement for such assurance.  However, if each level of hearsay independently meets the requirements for admissibility under an applicable hearsay exception, the circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness for such a statement is as great as for single-level hearsay.</P>
<P>  Instances of multi-level hearsay evidence are by no means uncommon.  For example, former testimony of an unavailable witness, which qualifies for admissibility under Rule 804(b)(1), might contain testimony of an excited utterance, a statement against interest, or an admission by a party-opponent.  Business records evidence presents multiple hearsay problems in cases where informants are not under a business duty, see the commentary to Rule 803(b)(6) supra.  As long as each level meets the requirement of independent qualification, this type of evidentiary complexity offers no unique problem.</P>
