In addition, the judgment creditor may mail a notice of the filing of the judgment to the judgment debtor and may file proof of mailing with the clerk.  The failure by the clerk to mail notice of filing shall not affect the enforcement proceedings if proof of mailing by the judgment creditor has been filed. [L 1996, c 49, pt of §1]</P>
