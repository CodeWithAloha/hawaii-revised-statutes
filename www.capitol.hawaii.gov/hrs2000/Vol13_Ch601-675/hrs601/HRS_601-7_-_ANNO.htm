<P>  Because judge ruled on the motion to disqualify judge, attorney’s failure to file timely motion to disqualify would not be deemed a waiver of attorney’s right to seek a disqualification; judge did not err when judge denied attorney’s disqualification motion.  76 H. 187, 873 P.2d 66.</P>
<P>  Where "evidence" of personal bias offered by defendant did not involve matters of personal interest to the judge but concerned primarily matters affecting the judge’s exercise of judicial discretion, motion for disqualification properly denied; also, neither imposition of jail sentence upon defendant nor scheduling of post-appeal hearings demonstrated bias on part of judge.  89 H. 371, 974 P.2d 11.</P>
<P>  Where alleged improper ex parte communication with judge by former officer of plaintiff regarding hotel was unrelated to case, former officer was not a party to the litigation or a witness, and judge did not know at time of conversation with former officer whether hotel was owned by plaintiff or defendant, no personal bias by judge under this section.  92 H. 243, 990 P.2d 713.</P>
