<P>  Confirmation of arbitration decision, discussed.  866 F.2d 1175.</P>
<P>  Fact that parties had right to appeal arbitration award, which had not yet been confirmed, modified, or corrected, was factor in determining that settlement agreement was based on disputed and unliquidated claim which parties resolved by promise of mutual concessions to terminate dispute.  72 H. 560, 825 P.2d 1053.</P>
<P>  Circuit court’s order granting defendant’s motion to confirm arbitration award constituted the entry of judgment and triggered the running of the time within which plaintiff could file plaintiff’s notice of appeal.  77 H. 88, 881 P.2d 1234.</P>
<P>  In arbitration cases, requirement in HRCP rule 58 that "every judgment be set forth in a separate document" superseded by this section and §658-15.  81 H. 403 (App.), 917 P.2d 730.</P>
<P>  Where the order confirming the arbitration award was, under this section, the judgment in the action, a motion to amend a later filed &quot;judgment&quot; did not trigger HRAP rule 4(a)(4) and thus did not affect the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.  90 H. 167, 977 P.2d 175.</P>
<P>  Where order expressly granted the motion to confirm the arbitration award but neither expressly confirmed the arbitration award or ordered the performance of the award, such order was the order confirming an arbitration award; where notice of appeal was not filed within thirty days of entry of this order as required under HRAP rule 4(a)(1), appeal dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  92 H. 206 (App.), 990 P.2d 104.</P>
<P>  Mentioned:  74 H. 210, 847 P.2d 652.</P>
