<P>&#9;Upon conclusion of sale, the owner shall immediately file with the treasurer a true and sworn statement containing a detailed list and inventory of such stock as has been sold at and during the sale, which statement shall include a description of each article sold sufficient to identify the same, the article's serial number, and the price received therefor.</P>
<P>&#9;The treasurer, at any time prior to the filing of the final statement with the treasurer, or within ten days thereafter, shall require the owner to file with the treasurer the invoices and bills of lading of any articles in the stock that appear from the preliminary statement to have been received by the owner within three months prior to the first day of the sale.  The statements, invoices, and bills of lading shall be open to inspection by any interested person upon application to the treasurer.  The sale at public auction shall be only of the stock on hand at the time of filing the statement with the treasurer, and the stock shall not be augmented or replenished in anticipation of the auction sale, or pending or during the sale.  The auction sale shall be held on successive days, Sundays and legal holidays excepted, and shall not continue for more than thirty days within the period of one year.  Failure to comply with any of the foregoing provisions shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the sale was not for the legitimate purpose of closing out the stock.</P>
