<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§453-6  Fees; expenses.</B>  No applicant shall be examined under this chapter until the applicant has paid to the board application, examination, and license fees.  The board may provide separate fees for licensure by endorsement and for limited and temporary licenses.  Every person holding a license under this chapter shall reregister with the board no later than January 31, of each even-numbered year and for that registration shall pay a renewal fee.  At the time of reregistration, the physician or surgeon shall present to the board evidence of compliance with a program of continuing medical education adopted by the board.  Failure to reregister and present evidence of compliance shall constitute a forfeiture of license, which may be restored only upon written application therefor and payment to the board of a restoration fee.  A license that has been forfeited for one renewal term shall be automatically terminated and cannot be restored, and a new application for licensure shall be required.
