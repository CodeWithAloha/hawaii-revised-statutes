Such information is to be used for the purpose of employment, training, educational, and career planning with a special view toward improving the relationship of current and projected supply and demand in the Hawaii work force.  It is also the purpose of this chapter to provide for the means to develop and deliver occupational and career information through an overall Hawaii occupational information system composed of a career information delivery system and an occupational employment planning system.  Additionally, coordination is to be provided for in the development, dissemination, and application of occupational and career information for the purposes of occupational, educational, employment, and training planning and for the delivery and use of career information in educational and occupational decision making by youth, trainees, and job seekers.  Although other agencies may operate programs to implement these purposes and authorities, a coordinating committee will facilitate the integration of occupational information into program planning.
