Service upon the director shall be made as provided by the rules of court.  In any action contemplated under this section, the director may ask, by way of affirmative relief, for the foreclosure of the aforementioned state tax liens, but in the absence of such request for affirmative relief, upon any foreclosure sale the property shall be sold subject to the tax liens.  Nothing in this section shall preclude the director from asking for such other and further relief as might have been claimed by intervention in the action.
