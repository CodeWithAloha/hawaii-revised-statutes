The tax credit shall be an amount equal to ten per cent of the investment made by the taxpayer in each qualified high technology business, up to a maximum allowed credit of $500,000 for the taxable year for the investment made by the taxpayer in a qualified high technology business.</P>

All claims, including any amended claims, for tax credits under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</P>
