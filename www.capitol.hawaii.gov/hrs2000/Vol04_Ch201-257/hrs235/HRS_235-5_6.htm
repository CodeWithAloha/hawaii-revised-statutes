<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§235-5.6]  Individual development account contribution tax credit.</B>  (a)  There shall be allowed to each taxpayer subject to the tax imposed under this chapter, an individual development account contribution tax credit certified under chapter 257 which shall be applied against the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The individual development account contribution tax credit shall be equal to fifty per cent of the amount contributed by the taxpayer to a fiduciary organization as defined by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 257.  If a deduction is taken under section 170 (with respect to charitable contributions and gifts) of the Internal Revenue Code, no tax credit shall be allowed for that portion of the contribution for which the deduction was taken.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of the tax credit over liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted.  All claims, including any amended claims, for tax credits under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Application for the credit under this section shall be upon forms provided by the department.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The credit under this section shall be available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, but shall not be available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004. [L 2000, c 184, §1]</P>
