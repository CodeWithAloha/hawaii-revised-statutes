All provisions of this chapter shall apply to the county general excise and use tax surcharge.  With respect to the surcharge, the director shall have all the rights and powers provided under this chapter.  In addition, the director of taxation shall have the exclusive rights and power to determine the county or counties in which a person imports or purchases tangible personal property and, in the case of a person importing or purchasing tangible property in more than one county, the director shall determine through apportionment or other means, that portion of the general excise and use tax surcharge attributable to the importation or purchase in each county.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Each county general excise and use tax surcharge shall be levied as of January&nbsp;1, 1993, and shall continue for a period of ten years through December&nbsp;31, 2002, or until earlier repealed.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No county general excise and use tax surcharge shall be established upon any use taxable under this chapter at the one- half per cent tax rate or upon any use that is not subject to taxation or that is exempt from taxation under this chapter.</P>

<P>&#9;The penalties provided by section 231<B>-</B>39 for failure to file a tax return shall be imposed on the amount of surcharge due on the return being filed for the failure to file the schedule required to accompany the return.
