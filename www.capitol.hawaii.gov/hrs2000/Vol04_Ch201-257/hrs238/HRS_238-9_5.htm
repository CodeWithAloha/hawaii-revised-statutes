The report shall contain the name and address of the dealer making the courtesy delivery, name and address of the seller of the vehicle, type of motor vehicle, the landed value of the vehicle, the name and address of the purchaser or importer, the date of importation, and other information relevant to the courtesy delivery as requested by the director.</P>
<P>&#9;As used in this section, "courtesy delivery" means the preparation for delivery and the delivery by a dealer of a motor vehicle imported into the State by a person who purchased the motor vehicle from an out-of-state motor vehicle manufacturer or an out-of-state dealer and does not apply to motor vehicles sold by the in-state dealer.
