<P>&#9;As used in this section, "small boats" means all vessels and other watercraft except those operated in overseas transportation beyond the State, and ocean-going tugs and dredges.  The chairperson of the board of land and natural resources, from July&nbsp;1, 1992, and every three years thereafter, shall establish standards or formulas that will as equitably as possible establish the total taxes collected under chapter 243 in each fiscal year that are derived from the sale of liquid fuel for use in or used for small boats.  The amount so determined shall be deposited in the boating special fund.</P>
<P>&#9;An amount equal to 0.3 per cent of the highway fuel tax but not more than $250,000 collected under chapter 243 shall be allocated each fiscal year to the special land and development fund for purposes of the management, maintenance, and development of trails and trail accesses under the jurisdiction of the department of land and natural resources established under section 198D-2.
