<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§248-2.5]  County general excise and use tax surcharge; disposition of proceeds.</B>  (a)  All county general excise and use tax surcharges collected by the director of taxation shall be paid into the state treasury each month within ten working days after collection, and shall be kept by the state director of finance in special accounts.  Out of the county general excise and use tax surcharges paid into the state treasury special accounts, the state director of finance shall retain, from time to time, sufficient amounts to reimburse the State for the costs of assessment, collection, and disposition of the county general excise and use tax surcharge incurred by the State.  Amounts retained shall be general fund realizations of the State.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The costs of assessment, collection, and disposition of county general excise and use tax surcharges shall be withheld from payment to the several counties by the State out of the county general excise and use tax surcharges collected for the current calendar year.</P>
<P>&#9;The costs of assessment, collection, and disposition of the county general excise and use tax surcharges shall be borne by each of the several counties in an amount proportional to the total amount of surcharges allocated to that county divided by the total amount of surcharges collected for the entire State for the preceding calendar year.</P>
<P>&#9;For the purpose of this section, the costs of assessment, collection, and disposition of the county general excise and use tax surcharges shall include any and all costs, direct or indirect, which are deemed necessary and proper to effectively administer this section and sections 237<B>-</B>8.5 and 238<B>-</B>2.5.  Costs include refunds or reductions of income taxes under section 235<B>-</B>110.7 attributable to the county general excise and use tax surcharge.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  After the deduction of the costs under subsection (b), the state director of finance shall pay the remaining balance on a monthly or quarterly basis to the director of finance for each county which has adopted a county general excise and use tax surcharge under section 46<B>-</B>16.7.  The payments shall be made as soon as possible after the county general excise and use tax surcharges have been paid into the state treasury special accounts, or after the disposition of any tax appeal, as the case may be.  All county general excise and use tax surcharges collected shall be distributed by the state director of finance to the county in which the county general excise tax surcharge is generated and shall be a general fund realization of the county to be used for the purposes specified in section 46<B>-</B>16.7 by each of the several counties.
