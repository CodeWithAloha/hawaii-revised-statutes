<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The person is suffering from a severe mental disorder or from substance abuse; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The person is capable of surviving safely in the community with available supervision from family, friends, or others; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The person, at some time in the past:  (A) has received inpatient hospital treatment for a severe mental disorder or substance abuse, or (B) has been imminently dangerous to self or others, or is gravely disabled, as a result of a severe mental disorder or substance abuse; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The person, based on the person's treatment history and current behavior, is now in need of treatment in order to prevent a relapse or deterioration which would predictably result in the person becoming imminently dangerous to self or others; and</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The person's current mental status or the nature of the person's disorder limits or negates the person's ability to make an informed decision to voluntarily seek or comply with recommended treatment; and</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(6)&#9;There is a reasonable prospect that the outpatient treatment ordered will be beneficial to the person. [L 1984, c 251, pt of §1; am L 1992, c 138, §2]</P>
