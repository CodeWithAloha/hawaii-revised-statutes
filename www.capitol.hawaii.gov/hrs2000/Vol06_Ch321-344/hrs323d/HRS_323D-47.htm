<P>&#9;(3)&#9;It demonstrates that the state agency has materially failed to follow its adopted procedures in reaching its decision;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;It provides such other bases for a public hearing as the state agency determines constitutes good causes; or</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The decision of the administrator differs from the recommendation of the statewide council.</P></DIR>
