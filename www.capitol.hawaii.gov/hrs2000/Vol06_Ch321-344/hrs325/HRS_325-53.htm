The department of health may investigate the circumstances surrounding the birth of any baby on whose mother no serologic test, as required by this part, appears to have been taken.  Failure on the part of any physician or other person permitted by law to attend pregnant women to comply with this part may be punished by an administrative fine in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation, to be assessed by the director of health.  The director of health is authorized to impose the penalty pursuant to this section.
