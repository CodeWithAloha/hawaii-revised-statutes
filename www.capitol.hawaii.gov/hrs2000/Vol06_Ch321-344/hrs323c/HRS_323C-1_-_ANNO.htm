<P>  A single state agency may fit more than one of the definitions (of terms within the definition of "entity"), depending on the capacity in which it is acting; an agency performing a function that did not fit any of the definitions was not an "entity".  Att. Gen. Op. 2000-2.</P>
<P>  Information that does not fit definition of "protected health information" is not subject to chapter 323C's protections.  Att. Gen. Op. 2000-2.</P>
<P>  Neither the disability compensation division (DCD) nor the labor and industrial relations appeals board (LIRAB) is an "entity" for purposes of chapter 323C when it reviews, evaluates, and decides on claims for workers' compensation.  Att. Gen. Op. 2000-2.</P>
