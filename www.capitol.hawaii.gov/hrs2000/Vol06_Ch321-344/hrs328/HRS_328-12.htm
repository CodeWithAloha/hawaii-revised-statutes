The holder of a permit so suspended shall be privileged at any time to apply for the reinstatement of the permit, and the department shall, immediately after prompt hearing and an inspection of the establishment, reinstate the permit if it is found that adequate measures have been taken to comply with and maintain the conditions of the permit, as originally issued, or as amended.</P>
<P>&#9;Any officer or employee duly designated by the director of health shall have access to any factory or establishment, the operator of which holds a permit from the department, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the conditions of the permit are being complied with, and denial of access for such inspection shall be grounds for suspension of the permit until such access is freely given by the operator.
