<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;As long as this State remains the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee, or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Until all of the parties who are individuals have filed written consents with the tribunal of this State for a tribunal of another state to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  A tribunal of this State issuing a child support order consistent with the law of this State may not exercise its continuing jurisdiction to modify the order if the order has been modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If a child support order of this State is modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, a tribunal of this State loses its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction with regard to prospective enforcement of the order issued in this State, and may only:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Enforce the order that was modified as to amounts accruing before the modification;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Enforce nonmodifiable aspects of that order; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Provide other appropriate relief for violations of that order which occurred before the effective date of the modification.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  A tribunal of this State shall recognize the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal of another state which has issued a child support order pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  A temporary support order issued ex parte or pending resolution of a jurisdictional conflict does not create continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in the issuing tribunal.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  A tribunal of this State issuing a support order consistent with the law of this State has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a spousal support order throughout the existence of the support obligation.  A tribunal of this State may not modify a spousal support order issued by a tribunal of another state having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over that order under the law of that state.
