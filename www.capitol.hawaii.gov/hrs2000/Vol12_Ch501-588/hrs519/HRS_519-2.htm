<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Such renegotiations shall not be scheduled more frequently than once every fifteen years, provided the first of such reopenings shall not be scheduled prior to the fifteenth year following the initial date of the lease; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Upon renegotiation, the lease rent payable shall not exceed the amount derived by multiplying the "owner's basis" by four per cent.  For purposes of this section, "owner's basis" means the current fair market value of the lot, excluding onsite improvements, valued as if the fee title were unencumbered; less the lessee's share, if any, of the current replacement cost of providing existing offsite improvements attributable to the land, which replacement cost shall include an overhead and profit not exceeding twenty per cent of the current replacement cost of the existing offsite improvements, or less the original lot development credit to the lessee, whichever is greater.  For purposes of this section, "offsite improvements" means all physical improvements such as, but not limited to, roads, sewer lines, sewage treatment plants, and underground utility cables, constructed or placed in a subdivision or development off the land intended for occupancy, which improvements are to be used in common by occupants of all lands adjoining such improvements or by occupants of all lands for whose benefit the improvements have been constructed or placed; and "onsite improvements" means all physical improvements placed on a residential lot intended for occupancy which improvements are for the benefit of occupants of that lot, including but not limited to, dwelling units, garages, service buildings, stairs, walkways, driveways, walls, trees, shrubs, landscaping, and pools.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  In the event the parties to a lease are unable to achieve an agreement under any reopening provision, the housing and community development corporation of Hawaii or its designee shall arbitrate, and its findings shall be binding and conclusive on both parties.  Arbitration proceedings under this subsection will be subject to the following requirements:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;An advance deposit, which amount shall be determined by the corporation, equal to projected expenses and fees of the corporation or its designee for arbitration proceedings shall be required and shall be paid equally by lessees and lessors.  All additional expenses and fees incurred by the corporation or its designee while acting as the arbitrator shall be borne equally by lessees and lessors.  These additional expenses and fees shall be subject to monthly billings or other arrangements which may be specified by contract.  If more than one lessee is involved in an arbitration proceeding, all lessees shall share equally in one-half of the arbitration costs.  The same division of costs shall apply if more than one lessor is involved in a proceeding.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Failure on the part of lessees to comply with the provisions set forth in this subsection, including failure to make advance deposits or payments, shall result in forfeiture of any rights or remedies under this chapter for arbitration, and the lessees' sole rights and remedies shall be as provided in the lease document.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If lessors fail to comply with the provisions of this subsection, including failure to make advance deposits or payments, then arbitration proceedings under this chapter will cease and the lease rent shall be set at the most recent fixed lease rent.  Upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the arbitration may proceed, with the determination of the new lease rent effective only from the date of compliance by the lessor.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) above, all new lease rents shall be effective as of the date of reopening.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;For the purpose of this subsection, "arbitration proceedings" means the actual arbitration conducted by the corporation or its designee pursuant to a contract executed by and among the lessees, lessor, and the arbitrator detailing among other things, the following:  description of properties involved, time of performance, compensation, method of payment, settlement and other procedures, and termination.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Any covenant or provision of a lease in violation of this section, shall not be enforceable in any court in this State.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  For the purpose of this section renegotiation shall not include negotiation for the determination of lease rental under section 516-66 arising out of an extension under section 516-65.
