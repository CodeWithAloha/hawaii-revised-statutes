<P>  Where child protective service caseworker's seven-day delay in filing a court petition for temporary custody violated state law (pre-1998 amendment), the state law did not clearly establish a federal right at the time caseworker removed appellant's children.  Neither the seven-day delay before obtaining post-deprivation judicial review, nor the seven-day delay before filing a court petition, violated appellant's federal due process rights.  141 F.3d 927.</P>
