<P>  With the exception of the two situations described in subsection (c)(3) (pre-1998), the court was not mandated to order a show cause hearing prior to holding a permanent plan hearing; thus, no error where court held permanent plan hearing without first ordering a show cause hearing.  89 H. 477 (App.), 974 P.2d 1067.</P>
