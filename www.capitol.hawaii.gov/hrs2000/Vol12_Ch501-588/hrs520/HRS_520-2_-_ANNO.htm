<P>  Plaintiff who suffered personal injuries while plaintiff was using a military recreational facility was not "charged" an "admission price or fee … in return for … permission to enter or go upon the [government's] land".  181 F.3d 1064.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff who was engaged in activity of boating argued that plaintiff was not engaging in a recreational activity while taking the sailing course, although plaintiff may have had professional as well as personal reasons for taking the course, plaintiff's alleged professional motivation did not convert plaintiff into a nonrecreational user; plaintiff's subjective intent was, in the situation, immaterial. 181 F.3d 1064.</P>
<P>  No requirement that landowner open property to every person in the public in order to obtain protection under statute; defendant's duty to recreational user of property arose where defendant undertook and posted lifeguards at beach.  691 F. Supp. 256.</P>
