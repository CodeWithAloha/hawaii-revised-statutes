Offers of sale and sales shall not resume until an effective date has been issued by the commission for the supplementary public report.  The developer shall provide all prospective purchasers with a true copy of the supplementary public report and all prior public reports not superseded by the supplementary public report.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The commission may determine when a supplementary public report will supersede the public reports previously issued for the project.</P>
