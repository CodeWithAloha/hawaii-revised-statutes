<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§526-13]  When disclaimer barred or limited.</B>  (a)  A disclaimer is barred by a written waiver of the right to disclaim.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  A disclaimer of an interest in property is barred if any of the following events occur before the disclaimer becomes effective:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(1)&#9;The disclaimant accepts the interest sought to be disclaimed;</P>
<P>(2)&#9;The disclaimant voluntarily assigns, conveys, encumbers, pledges, or transfers the interest sought to be disclaimed or contracts to do so; or</P>
<P>(3)&#9;A judicial sale of the interest sought to be disclaimed occurs.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  A disclaimer, in whole or part, of the future exercise of a power held in a fiduciary capacity is not barred by its previous exercise.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A disclaimer, in whole or part, of the future exercise of a power not held in a fiduciary capacity is not barred by its previous exercise unless the power is exercisable in favor of the disclaimant.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  A disclaimer is barred or limited if so provided by law other than this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  A disclaimer of a power over property which is barred by this section is ineffective.  A disclaimer of an interest in property which is barred by this section takes effect as a transfer of the interest disclaimed to the persons who would have taken the interest under this chapter had the disclaimer not been barred.
