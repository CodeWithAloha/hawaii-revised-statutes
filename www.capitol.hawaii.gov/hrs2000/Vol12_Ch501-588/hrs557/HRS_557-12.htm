<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§557-12]  Underproductive property.</B>  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a portion of the net proceeds of sale of any part of principal which consists of property, other than securities listed on a national securities exchange or traded in over the counter, which has not produced an average net income of at least one per cent per year of its inventory value for more than a year (including as income the value of any beneficial property by the income beneficiary) shall be treated as delayed income to which the income beneficiary is entitled as provided in this section.  The net proceeds of sale are the gross proceeds received, including the value of any property received in substitution for the property disposed of, less the expenses, including capital gains tax, if any, incurred in disposition and less any carrying charges paid while the property was underproductive. </P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The sum allocated as delayed income is the difference between the net proceeds and the amount which, had it been invested at simple interest at four per cent per year while the property was underproductive, would have produced the net proceeds.  This sum, plus any carrying charges and expenses previously charged against income while the property was underproductive, less any income received by the income beneficiary from the property and less the value of any beneficial use of the property by the income beneficiary, is income, and the balance is principal. </P>
<P>&#9;(c)  An income beneficiary or the income beneficiary's estate is entitled to delayed income under this section as if it accrued from day to day during the time the income beneficiary was a beneficiary. </P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If principal subject to this section is disposed of by conversion into property which cannot be apportioned easily, including land or mortgages (for example, realty acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure), the income beneficiary is entitled to the net income from any property or obligation into which the original principal is converted while the substituted property or obligation is held.  If within five years after the conversion the substituted property has not been further converted into easily apportionable property, no allocation as provided in this section shall be made.
