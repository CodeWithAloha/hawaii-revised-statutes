<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§560:7-305  Trustee's duties; appropriate place of administration; deviation.</B>  A trustee is under a continuing duty to administer the trust at a place appropriate to the purposes of the trust and to its sound, efficient management.  If the principal place of administration becomes inappropriate the court may for good cause enter any order furthering efficient administration and the interests of beneficiaries, including, if appropriate, release of registration, removal of the trustee, designation of administration in another state, and appointment of a trustee in another state.  Trust provisions relating to the place of administration and to changes in the place of administration or of trustee control unless compliance would be contrary to efficient administration or the purposes of the trust.  Views of adult beneficiaries shall be given weight pursuant to section 554-2, in determining the suitability of the trustee and the place of administration.
