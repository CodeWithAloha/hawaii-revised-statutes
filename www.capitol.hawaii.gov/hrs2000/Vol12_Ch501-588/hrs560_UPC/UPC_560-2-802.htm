An individual who has terminated a reciprocal beneficiary relationship with the decedent is not deemed a surviving reciprocal beneficiary unless, by virtue of a subsequent registration as a reciprocal beneficiary, the individual is the reciprocal beneficiary of the decedent at the time of death.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  For purposes of parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this article, and of section 560:3-203, a surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary does not include:</P><DIR>
