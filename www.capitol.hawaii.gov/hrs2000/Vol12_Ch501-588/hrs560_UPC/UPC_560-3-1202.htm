<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§560:3-1202</B>  <B>Effect of affidavit.</B>  The person paying, delivering, transferring, or issuing personal property or the evidence thereof pursuant to affidavit is discharged and released to the same extent as if that person dealt with a personal representative of the decedent.  That person is not required to see to the application of the personal property or evidence thereof or to inquire into the truth of any statement in the affidavit.  If any person to whom an affidavit is delivered refuses to pay, deliver, transfer, or issue any personal property or evidence thereof, it may be recovered or its payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance compelled upon proof of their right in a proceeding brought for the purpose by or on behalf of the persons entitled thereto.  Any person to whom payment, delivery, transfer or issuance is made is answerable and accountable therefor to any personal representative of the estate or to any other person having a superior right.
