<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§560:3-309</B> <B> Informal appointment proceedings; registrar not satisfied.</B>  If the registrar is not satisfied that a requested informal appointment of a personal representative should be made because of failure to meet the requirements of sections 560:3-307 and 560:3-308, or for any other reason, the registrar may decline the application.  A declination of informal appointment is not an adjudication and does not preclude appointment in formal proceedings.
