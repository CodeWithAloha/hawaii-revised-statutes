<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§517D-9]  Release of restrictions on use or investment.</B>  (a)  With the written consent of the donor, the governing board may release, in whole or in part, a restriction imposed by the applicable gift instrument on the use or investment of an institutional fund.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If written consent of the donor cannot be obtained by reason of the donor's death, disability, unavailability, or impossibility of identification, the governing board may petition in the name of the institution to the circuit court for release of a restriction imposed by the applicable gift instrument on the use or investment of an institutional fund.  Unless the gift instrument specifically requires notice to other persons, only the attorney general shall be notified of the petition and shall be given an opportunity to be heard.  If the court finds that the restriction is obsolete, inappropriate, or impracticable, it may by order release the restriction in whole or in part.  A release under this subsection may not change an endowment fund to a fund that is not an endowment fund.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A release under this section may not allow a fund to be used for purposes other than the educational, religious, charitable, or other eleemosynary purposes of the institution affected.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  This section does not limit the application of the doctrine of cy pres.
