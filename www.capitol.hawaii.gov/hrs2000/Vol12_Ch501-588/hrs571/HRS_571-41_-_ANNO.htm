<P>  Preponderance of evidence standard applies only to adjudicatory and post-adjudicatory proceedings.  61 H. 48, 594 P.2d 1084.</P>
<P>  Probation revocation hearing, procedural requirements.  62 H. 70, 610 P.2d 509.</P>
<P>  Provision relating to admissibility of evidence at the dispositional phase of hearing is consistent with due process. 62 H. 70, 610 P.2d 509.</P>
<P>  Right to counsel; waiver.  63 H. 162, 623 P.2d 86.</P>
<P>  District court has concurrent jurisdiction with family court in DUI cases where defendant is a minor.  69 H. 455, 746 P.2d 82.</P>
<P>  District court may not impose a sentence of imprisonment for a traffic offense.  70 H. 328, 770 P.2d 418.</P>
<P>  Because subsection (c) lacks any express standards governing the exercise of the court’s discretion to join cases or to account for situations where joinder may result in unfair prejudice to one of the minors, family court’s use of HRPP rules 8, 13, and 14, in and of itself, did not conflict with subsection (c) and thus, was not reversible error.  79 H. 265 (App.), 900 P.2d 1332.</P>
