The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the child and may assess the reasonable fees and expenses of the guardian ad litem as costs of the action, payable in whole or in part by any or all parties as the circumstances may justify.  In the event the child is not made a party to the action, a determination that the child was not born to parents married to each other at the time of the child's birth shall not be binding upon the child.
