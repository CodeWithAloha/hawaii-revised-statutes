<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§431:16-112  Exhaustion of other coverage.</B>  (a)  Any person having a claim against an insurer whether or not the insurer is a member insurer under any provision in an insurance policy other than a policy of an insolvent insurer which is also a covered claim, shall be required to exhaust first the person's rights under the policy.  Any amount payable on a covered claim under this part shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under the insurance policy.  If there are any other policies issued by an insolvent insurer applicable to the covered claim, then all such policies must first be exhausted before any claim can be deemed a covered claim subject to being covered by the association.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Any person having a claim that may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall seek recovery first from the association of the place of residence of the insured, except that if the claim is a first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, the person shall seek recovery first from the association of the location of the property.  For a workers' compensation claim, the person shall seek recovery first from the association of the residence of the claimant.  Any recovery under this part shall be reduced by the amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 2000, c 93, §11]</P>
