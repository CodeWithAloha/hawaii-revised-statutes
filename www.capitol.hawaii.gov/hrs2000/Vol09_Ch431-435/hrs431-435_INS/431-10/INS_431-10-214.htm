<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§431:10-214  Right to return policy.</B>  (a)  There shall be printed on or attached to every individual life insurance policy and every individual disability policy issued for delivery in this State a notice in ten-point bold type stating in substance that the person to whom the policy is issued is entitled to return the policy or contract within ten days of its receipt by said purchaser and to have the premium paid refunded if the purchaser is not satisfied with it for any reason.  If, pursuant to such notice, a purchaser mails or delivers the policy to the company or association at its home or branch office or to the agent through whom it was purchased, it shall be void from the beginning and the parties shall be in the same position as if no policy had been issued.  When an individual life insurance policy is mailed or delivered by the purchaser within the ten-day period, the insurer may be reimbursed for the actual medical examination expenses incurred in processing the policy or contract, provided the foregoing notice includes a statement to this effect.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  This section shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies or travel accident policies. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</P>
