In the case of agent solicitations, an agent shall deliver the outline of coverage prior to the presentation of an application or enrollment form.  In the case of direct response solicitation, the outline of coverage shall be presented in conjunction with any application or enrollment form.  In the case of a policy issued to a group defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of "group long-term care insurance" in section 431:10H-104, an outline of coverage shall not be required to be delivered; provided that the information described [in] subsection (b) is contained in other materials relating to enrollment.  Upon request, these other materials shall be made available to the commissioner.</P>
