<P>  See also notes at end of this chapter.</P>
<P>  Provision excluding welfare recipients from receiving medical coverage under no-fault automobile insurance policies violated Medicaid provision of Social Security Act.  928 F.2d 898.</P>
<P>  Vehicle was "uninsured" where vehicle operator's liability insurance did not cover injured passenger and vehicle owner had no insurance.  807 F. Supp. 98.</P>
<P>  Households of plaintiff and spouse were separate and not a family unit for purposes of paragraph (11).  812 F. Supp. 1083.</P>
<P>  Where named insured is a corporation, son of officer/shareholder of corporation is not an "insured" under paragraph (11).  816 F. Supp. 633.</P>
<P>  Insurer not obligated to defend or indemnify insured, or otherwise pay any sums to defendants; defendant’s shooting was no accident from insured’s viewpoint or perspective.  834 F. Supp. 329.</P>
<P>  Where insurer contended that plaintiff lacked standing to bring bad faith claim because plaintiff, a covered person under taxicab owner's insurance contract, was not defined as an insured in no-fault insurance statute, plaintiff, a third party beneficiary of taxicab owner's policy, was essentially an insured and to treat plaintiff otherwise made no sense.  947 F. Supp. 429.</P>
<P>  Trial court erred in concluding that insurance company did not owe defendant duty to defend or indemnify on basis that shooting did not arise out of a motor vehicle "accident".  74 H. 620, 851 P.2d 321.</P>
<P>  Car rental company not an "insurer" as defined under paragraph (5).  82 H. 351, 922 P.2d 964.</P>
<P>  Where self-insurer rent-a-car company not an "insurer" as defined in this section, court erred in granting attorney's fees and costs under §431:10-242.  85 H. 243, 942 P.2d 507.</P>
<P>  Insofar as Hawaii administrative rule §16-23-11 conflicted with paragraph (10)(B) (1987) by limiting survivors’ benefits to $15,000 despite the presence of expanded no-fault coverage, §16-23-11 was void as a matter of law.  88 H. 344, 966 P.2d 1070.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits under Hawaii motor vehicle insurance law where an "uninsured motor vehicle" as defined in this section was not involved in causing plaintiff's injuries.  81 H. 110 (App.), 912 P.2d 607.</P>
<P>  Pursuant to §431:10C-304(1)(B) (1987) and paragraph (10)(B) (1987), upon the death of an insured, the insurer is obligated to provide the insured’s survivor a survivor’s loss benefit of up to either (1) $15,000 where the insured has purchased only the basic no-fault coverage, or (2) the expanded limits of no-fault benefits where the insured has contracted for it under an optional additional coverage.  88 H. 345 (App.), 966 P.2d 1071.</P>
