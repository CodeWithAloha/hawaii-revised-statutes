<P>  Section (pre-1997) does not violate constitutional right to the equal protection of the laws as applied to persons ineligible for no-fault benefits.  87 H. 297, 955 P.2d 90.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff did not satisfy minimum level of qualifying expenses necessary to maintain action under subsection (b)(2) (1993) where plaintiff did not present: (1) evidence that medical expenses plaintiff claimed in motor vehicle tort lawsuit were paid, thereby triggering statutory presumption that they were reasonable and necessary; nor (2) expert testimony establishing that the expenses were reasonable and necessary.  88 H. 251, 965 P.2d 793.</P>
<P>  Trial court erred in entering judgment for defendant as subsection (b)(2) does not require that jury return verdict in excess of medical-rehabilitative limit established by §431:10C-308, but only requires that "amount paid or accrued" exceeds this limit.  80 H. 188 (App.), 907 P.2d 774.</P>
