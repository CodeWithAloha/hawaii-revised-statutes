<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§431:15-312  Duties of agents.</B>  (a)  Every person who receives notice in the form prescribed in section 431:15-311 that an insurer whom the agent represents is the subject of a liquidation order, shall within fifteen days of such notice give notice of the liquidation order.  The notice shall be sent by first class mail to the last address contained in the agent's records to each policyholder or other person named in any policy issued through the agent by the insurer, if the agent has a record of the address of the policyholder or other person.  A policy shall be deemed issued through an agent if the agent has a property interest in the expiration of the policy, or if the agent has had possession of a copy of the declarations of the policy at any time during the life of the policy, except where the ownership of the expiration of the policy has been transferred to another.  The written notice shall include the name and address of the insurer, the name and address of the agent, identification of the policy impaired and the nature of the impairment including termination of coverage, as described in section 431:15-308.  Notice by a general agent satisfies the notice requirement for any agents under contract to it.  Each agent obligated to give notice under this section shall file a report of compliance with the liquidator.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Any agent failing to give notice or file a report of compliance as required in subsection (a) may be subject to payment of a penalty of not more than $1,000 and such agent's license may be suspended, said penalty to be imposed after a hearing held by the commissioner.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The liquidator may waive the duties imposed by this section if the liquidator determines that other notice to the policyholders of the insurer under liquidation is adequate. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</P>
