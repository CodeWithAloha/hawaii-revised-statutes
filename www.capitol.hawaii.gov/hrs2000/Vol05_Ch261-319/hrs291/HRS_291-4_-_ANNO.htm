<P>  Section provides two alternative means of proving a single offense; bifurcating the two methods of proof into separate trials violated defendant's due process rights.  70 H. 528, 777 P.2d 1187.</P>
<P>  State did not have to show that prior conviction was counseled where defendant's second conviction imposed no increase in sentence.  71 H. 147, 785 P.2d 1311.</P>
<P>  Proof that defendant was driving on a public highway was not required.  71 H. 258, 787 P.2d 691.</P>
<P>  Court went beyond statute in its instructions to the jury.  71 H. 319, 789 P.2d 1122.</P>

<P>  Charge of first-offense DUI under this section as amended by Act 128, L 1993, was constitutionally petty, therefore, no right to jury trial attached to first-offense DUI; retrospective application of this section, as amended by Act 128 did not violate the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution; retroactive application of decision to pending cases passed test enunciated in State v. Ikezawa; Act 128 did not violate equal protection.  76 H. 360, 878 P.2d 699.</P>

<P>  Circuit court erred in its ruling on the applicability of HRPP rule 48 to DUI cases.  78 H. 367, 893 P.2d 795.</P>
<P>  Both the circuit and district courts have concurrent jurisdiction over DUI cases.  78&nbsp;H. 367, 893 P.2d 795.</P>
<P>  Since ADLRO proceedings serve legitimate, nonpunitive, purely remedial functions, defendant's subsequent criminal prosecution not barred by double jeopardy, res judicata, and/or collateral estoppel principles. 79 H. 1, 897 P.2d 928. </P>
<P>  Defendant’s arguments that defendant’s conviction (DUI in violation of subsection (a)(2)) was not supported by substantial evidence and was inconsistent with defendant’s acquittal in count I (violation of subsection (a)(1)), rejected; where defendant was charged in two counts alleging one DUI offense, trial court did not commit plain error by instructing jury that defendant was charged with more than one offense.  79 H. 336, 902 P.2d 971.</P>
<P>  As §286-261(d) does not require defendant to submit to needs assessment nor undergo any treatment for alcohol dependence, application of that section with DUI conviction under this section not double jeopardy violation.  80 H. 8, 904 P.2d 893.</P>
<P>  Defendant not subjected to multiple punishments as a result of administrative driver's license revocation under §286-261 and DUI conviction under this section as administrative revocation non-punitive and purely remedial in nature.  81 H. 226, 915 P.2d 700.</P>
<P>  Ninety-day suspension of driver's license under this section for drunken bicyclist not unconstitutional where:  (1) no showing that disparity of risk between drunken bicyclists and drunken automobile drivers is so great; and (2) suspension not disproportionately onerous compared to more serious crimes in same jurisdiction and for the same offense in different jurisdictions.  87 H. 249, 953 P.2d 1347.</P>
<P>  "Vehicle" under this section includes bicycles; application of section to defendant bicyclist not absurd.  87 H. 249, 953 P.2d 1347.</P>
<P>  Where conviction is based solely on a chemical test, the results of the test when taken together with its tolerance for error must equal or exceed the statutory level.  1 H. App. 44, 613 P.2d 916.</P>
<P>  Mandatory sentence not applicable where defendant committed second DUI offense before being convicted of first.  5 H. App. 205, 683 P.2d 400.</P>
<P>  Defendant charged under section has right to jury trial; not unconstitutionally vague.  5 H. App. 491, 704 P.2d 905, aff'd 68 H. 39, 704 P.2d 883.</P>
<P>  Defendant may challenge reliability of intoxilyzer test.  7 H. App. 20, 740 P.2d 1017.</P>
<P>  Results of intoxilyzer test properly admitted.  7 H. App. 440, 777 P.2d 717.</P>
<P>  Governmental approval of breath testing instrument and of procedures of its use are sufficient basis for reasonable inference that instrument measures blood alcohol concentration by weight, as required by statute.  7 H. App. 542, 783 P.2d 1235.</P>
<P>  Second intoxilyzer test was valid even if observation period was less than fifteen minutes.  7 H. App. 627, 789 P.2d 1133.</P>
<P>  DUI conviction reversed because jury instruction required jurors to infer a presumed fact.  7 H. App. 631, 790 P.2d 340.</P>
<P>  Finding mens rea not required for conviction.  8 H. App. 145, 795 P.2d 285.</P>
<P>  DUI conviction reversed where State failed to lay proper foundation for admission into evidence of test result obtained from breath-testing instrument.  9 H. App. 130, 828 P.2d 813.</P>
<P>  DUI conviction proper where prior accuracy verification test on intoxilyzer used showed it was operating accurately.  9 H. App. 291, 836 P.2d 506.</P>
<P>  No reversible error in admitting intoxilyzer test result into evidence where State laid adequate evidentiary foundation.  80 H. 102 (App.), 905 P.2d 77.</P>
<P>  Under subsection (a)(2), prosecution must establish that result of chemical test involved, when taken together with its tolerance for error, must equal or exceed the statutory threshold of .10 BAC to prove that actual weight of alcohol in defendant's blood was at least 0.10 per cent.  80 H. 138 (App.), 906 P.2d 624.</P>
<P>  Where intoxilyzer measured BAC level to a thousandth of one per cent, any error in receiving the thousandth reading in evidence was harmless, as evidence indicated thousandth digit reading was irrelevant.  80 H. 138 (App.), 906 P.2d 624.</P>
<P>  Where evidence not presented at trial that defendant received counsel or intelligently waived counsel at prior DUI convictions, proof for enhanced sentencing purposes not satisfied.  81 H. 76 (App.), 912 P.2d 573.</P>
