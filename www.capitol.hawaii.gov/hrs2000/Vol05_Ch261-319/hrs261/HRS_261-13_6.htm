<P>&#9;(e)  There is established an advisory committee within each county which shall sit in an advisory capacity to the director on matters relating to the helicopter master plan for each state airport.  Each advisory committee shall consist of not more than thirteen members to be appointed by the director and whose membership shall include representatives from the helicopter industry and the communities adjacent to the airport.
