<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§261C-19]  Review and appeals.</B>  (a)  Within ten days after the issuance of any final decision or order of the commission under this chapter, any party aggrieved by the action of the commission may submit a petition to the director of transportation requesting the director to review the decision or order.  The filing of any petition shall stay the effectiveness of the decision or order until the director has issued a final decision on review.  The director may affirm in whole or in part the order or decision of the commission or remand it to the commission for further consideration, in which case the order or decision shall remain stayed until it is again submitted to and approved by the director.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  An appeal from an order of the air carrier commission under this chapter, whether or not reviewed by the director, shall be made to the supreme court in the manner and within the time provided by chapter 602 and the rules of court; provided that the order is final.  If the order is preliminary, an appeal may be made pursuant to section 91-14(a).  The appeal shall not of itself stay the operation of the order appealed from, but the court may stay the order after a hearing upon a motion therefor, and may impose such conditions as it may deem proper as to giving a bond and keeping the necessary accounts or otherwise securing restitution of the excess charges, if any, made during the pendency of the appeal in case the order appealed from should be sustained, revised, or modified, in whole or in part.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Any party injured by a violation of this chapter may file an action to enjoin such violation before any court of general jurisdiction of the State. [L 1993, c 332, pt of §2]</P>
