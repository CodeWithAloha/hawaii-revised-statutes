<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§264-26  Combination of federal and state funds.</B>  (a)  Every agreement for the engineering or construction of federal-aid highways or for the acquisition of rights-of-way for these highways shall be made on behalf of the State by the director of transportation.  Section 103D-309 shall apply only to that portion of the price that is payable out of local funds.  As to that portion of the price that is payable out of federal-aid funds, the agreement is that the State will pay the contractor only out of federal funds actually received for that portion of the project and is not a general agreement on the part of the State to pay that portion out of any other funds.  Each agreement shall be deemed to contain a provision to that effect whether specifically included or not.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Any moneys appropriated for the State's share of the price or any moneys in the state highway fund created by section 248-8, in the discretion of the director, may be drawn upon to advance the federal share of payments (1) earned by contractors on federal-aid projects for completed portions of the work, or (2) due the owners for property conveyed by them where the necessary federal-aid moneys are not immediately forthcoming, the appropriation or fund to be reimbursed for the advances when federal-aid moneys are received.
