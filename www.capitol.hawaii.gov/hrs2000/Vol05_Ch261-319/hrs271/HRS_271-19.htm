The commission may upon complaint or upon its own initiative, after notice and hearing, suspend or revoke any certificate or permit, in part or in whole, if the holder thereof is found to be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter; provided that a motor carrier's right to engage in transportation by virtue of any certificate or permit may be suspended by the commission immediately without hearing or other proceedings upon the carrier's failure to comply, and until the carrier complies with sections 271-21(a), 271-22(a), 271-17 or Act 20, Special Session Laws of Hawaii 1977, or with any lawful order of the commission.</P>
<P> &#9;(b)  Upon written request by a motor carrier and for good cause shown, the public utilities commission may place an active certificate or permit in an inactive status.

Prior to the termination of the approved inactive period, the certificate or permit must be reactivated or it shall be declared abandoned and the certificate or permit revoked.  The certificate or permit may be reactivated at any time within the approved period by fulfilling the requirements for renewal, including the payment of the appropriate fees.  No request for inactive status, the cumulative period of which is in excess of two years, shall be granted by the commission.  Unless good cause is shown, no request to transfer a certificate or permit which is on inactive status shall be approved by the commission.</P>
