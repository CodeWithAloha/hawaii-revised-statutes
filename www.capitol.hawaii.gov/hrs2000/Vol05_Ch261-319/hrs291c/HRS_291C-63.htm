<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§291C-63]  Vehicle entering stop or yield intersection.</B>  (a)  Preferential right of way at an intersection may be indicated by stop signs or yield signs.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Except when directed to proceed by a police officer or traffic-control signal, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right of way to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which is approaching so closely on the other highway as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such driver is moving across or within the intersection.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall in obedience to such sign slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and, if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway.  After slowing or stopping, the driver shall yield the right of way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another highway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection; provided that if such a driver is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the intersection, after driving past a yield sign without stopping, the collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right of way. [L 1971, c 150, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]</P>
