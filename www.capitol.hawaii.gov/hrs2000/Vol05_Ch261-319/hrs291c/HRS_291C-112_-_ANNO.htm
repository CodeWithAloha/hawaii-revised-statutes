<P>  Because defendant was a person to whom this section directly applied, and defendant's expressive conduct was not at issue, defendant did not have standing to assert overbreath challenge based on a hypothetical application of this section.  82 H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170.</P>
<P>  No equal protection violation as section rationally furthers legitimate state interest in protecting health and welfare of public at large.  82 H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170.</P>
<P>  This section, which prohibits the use of a vehicle "for purposes of human habitation", not unconstitutionally vague.  82 H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170.</P>
