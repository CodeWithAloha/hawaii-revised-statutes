<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Twenty-five days from the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued in a case involving an alcohol related offense; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Thirty-nine days from the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued in a case involving a drug related offense.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The director may continue the hearing only as provided in subsection (j).</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The hearing shall be held at a place designated by the director, as close to the location where the notice of administrative revocation was issued as practical.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The respondent may be represented by counsel and, if the respondent is under the age of eighteen, must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The director shall conduct the hearing and have authority to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Administer oaths and affirmations;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Examine witnesses and take testimony;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Receive and determine the relevance of evidence;</P>

<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Make a final ruling.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  The director shall affirm the administrative revocation only if the director determines that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;There existed reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle, the vehicle was stopped at an intoxicant control roadblock established and operated in compliance with sections 291E-19 and 291E-20, or the person was tested pursuant to section 291E-21;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;There existed probable cause to believe that the respondent operated the vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The evidence proves by a preponderance that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The respondent operated the vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The respondent operated the vehicle and, after being informed of the sanctions of this part, refused to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(f)  The respondent's prior alcohol and drug enforcement contacts shall be entered into evidence.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  The sworn statements provided in section 291E-36 shall be admitted into evidence.  Upon notice to the director, no later than five days prior to the hearing, that the respondent wishes to examine a law enforcement official who made a sworn statement, the director shall issue a subpoena for the official to appear at the hearing.  If the official cannot appear, the official, at the discretion of the director, may testify by telephone.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  The hearing shall be recorded in a manner to be determined by the director.</P>
<P>&#9;(i)  The director's decision shall be rendered in writing and mailed to the respondent, or to the parent or guardian of the respondent if the respondent is under the age of eighteen, no later than five days after the hearing is concluded.  If the decision is to reverse the administrative revocation, the director shall return the respondent's license, along with a certified statement that administrative revocation proceedings have been terminated.  If the decision sustains the administrative revocation, the director shall mail to the respondent a written decision indicating the duration of the administrative revocation and any other conditions or restrictions as may be imposed pursuant to section 291E-41.</P>
<P>&#9;(j)  For good cause shown, the director may grant a continuance either of the commencement of the hearing or of a hearing that has already commenced.  If a continuance is granted at the request of the director, the director shall extend the validity of the temporary permit, unless otherwise prohibited, for a period not to exceed the period of the continuance.  If a continuance is granted at the request of the respondent, the director shall not extend the validity of the temporary permit.  For purposes of this section, a continuance means a delay in the commencement of the hearing or an interruption of a hearing that has commenced, other than for recesses during the day or at the end of the day or week.</P>
<P>&#9;(k)  If the respondent fails to appear at the hearing, or if a respondent under the age of eighteen fails to appear with a parent or guardian, administrative revocation shall take effect for the period and under the conditions established by the director in the administrative review decision issued by the director under section 291E-37.
