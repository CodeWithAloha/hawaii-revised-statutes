<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§291E-39]  Fees and costs.</B>  The director may assess and collect a $30 fee from the respondent to cover the costs of processing the respondent's request for an administrative hearing.  These costs include but should not be limited to: the cost of photocopying documents; the issuance of subpoenas, conditional permits, and relicensing forms; interpreter services; law enforcement official mileage fees; and other similar costs.  The director may waive the fee in the case of an indigent respondent, upon an appropriate inquiry into the financial circumstances of the respondent seeking the waiver and an affidavit or a certificate signed by the respondent demonstrating the respondent's financial inability to pay the fee.
