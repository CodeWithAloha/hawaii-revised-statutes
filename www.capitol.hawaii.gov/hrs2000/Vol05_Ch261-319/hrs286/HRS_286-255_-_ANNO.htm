<P>  Where information conveyed to defendant regarding defendant’s rights under this chapter was inaccurate and misleading, defendant was precluded from knowingly and intelligently consenting to the blood alcohol test in violation of this chapter; trial court thus properly suppressed blood test results in defendant’s criminal DUI prosecution.  92 H. 45, 987 P.2d 268.</P>
<P>  Section requires an arresting officer to indicate on the notice of administrative license revocation that the notice shall serve as a temporary driver’s permit, unless the arrestee falls within any of the disqualifying categories listed in this section; arresting officer’s error in failing to mark notice did not warrant reversal of license revocation in light of policy objectives of this part and credit by director for days of driving privileges lost to reduce period of license suspension was appropriate remedy for officer’s error.  91 H. 125 (App.), 980 P.2d 999.</P></FONT><!-- This document is the property of the Hawaii State Legislature and a government record.
