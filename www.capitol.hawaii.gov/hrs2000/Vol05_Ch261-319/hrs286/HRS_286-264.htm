<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A sworn statement from the arrestee's employer establishing that the employer will in fact discharge the arrestee if the arrestee is prohibited from driving.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  A request made pursuant to subsection (a)(2) shall be accompanied by a sworn statement by the arrestee attesting to the specific facts upon which the request is based, which statement shall be verified by the director.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A conditional permit may include restrictions allowing the arrestee to drive: </P><DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In addition, the director may impose any other appropriate restrictions.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The duration of the conditional permit shall be determined on the basis of the criteria set forth in section 286-264(b) and (c).</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  If the arrestee violates the conditions imposed under this section, the conditional permit shall be rescinded and administrative revocation shall be immediate for the appropriate period authorized by law.
