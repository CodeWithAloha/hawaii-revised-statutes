<P>  As section does not require defendant to submit to needs assessment nor undergo any treatment for alcohol dependence, application of section with DUI conviction under §291-4 not double jeopardy violation.  80 H. 8, 904 P.2d 893.</P>
<P>  Section mandates that whenever license is administratively revoked under revocation program, offender shall be referred to certified substance abuse counselor for assessment.  80 H. 8, 904 P.2d 893.</P>
<P>  Defendant not subjected to multiple punishments as a result of administrative driver's license revocation under this section and DUI conviction under §291-4 as administrative revocation non-punitive and purely remedial in nature.  81 H. 226, 915 P.2d 700.</P>
<P>  Because counseling and assessment, as consequence of license revocation under subsection (d), not punitive but purely remedial, subsequent DUI conviction did not expose defendant to multiple "punishments"; defendant's motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds thus properly denied.  82 H. 446, 923 P.2d 388.</P>
<P>  Director lacked discretion to impose any period of administrative revocation upon defendant other than "for life" where defendant was member of class of persons under subsection (b)(4) and written administrative record was not deficient in any respect.  84 H. 138, 931 P.2d 580.</P>
