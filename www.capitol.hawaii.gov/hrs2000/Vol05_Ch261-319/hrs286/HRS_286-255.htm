<P>the arresting officer immediately shall take possession of any license held by the person and request the arrestee to take a test for alcohol concentration.  The arresting officer shall inform the person that the person has the option to take a breath test, a blood test, or both.  The arresting officer also shall inform the person of the sanctions under this part, including the sanction for refusing to take a breath or a blood test.  Thereafter, the arresting officer shall complete and issue to the arrestee a notice of administrative revocation and shall indicate thereon whether the notice shall serve as a temporary driver's permit.  The notice shall serve as a temporary driver's permit, unless, at the time of arrest, the arrestee was unlicensed, the arrestee's license was revoked or suspended, or the arrestee had no license in the arrestee's possession.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Whenever the police determine that, as the result of a blood test performed pursuant to section 286-163(b) and (c), there is probable cause to believe that a person being treated in a hospital or medical facility has violated section 291-4 or 291-4.4, the police shall complete and issue to the person a notice of administrative revocation and shall indicate thereon whether the notice shall serve as a temporary driver's permit.  The notice shall serve as a temporary driver's permit unless, at the time the notice was issued, the person was unlicensed, the person's license was revoked or suspended, or the person had no license in the person's possession.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Whenever an arrestee under this section is a repeat intoxicated driver, the arresting officer shall take possession of the motor vehicle registration and, if the motor vehicle being driven by the arrestee is registered to the arrestee, remove the license plates and issue a temporary motor vehicle registration and temporary license plates for the motor vehicle.  No temporary motor vehicle registration and license plates shall be issued if the arrestee's registration has expired or been revoked.  The appropriate police department, upon determining that the arrestee is a repeat intoxicated driver, shall notify the appropriate county director of finance to enter a stopper on the motor vehicle registration files to prevent the arrestee from conducting any motor vehicle transactions, except as permitted under this part.
