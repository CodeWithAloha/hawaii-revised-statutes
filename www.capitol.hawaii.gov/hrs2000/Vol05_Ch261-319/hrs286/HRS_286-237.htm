The word "nonresident" must appear on the face of the nonresident commercial driver's license.  Prior to issuing a nonresident commercial driver's license, the examiner of drivers must establish the practical capability of revoking, suspending, and canceling the nonresident commercial driver's license and disqualifying that person with the same conditions applicable to the commercial driver's license issued to a resident of this State.
