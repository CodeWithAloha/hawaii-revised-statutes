The appeal shall not of itself stay the operation of the order appealed from, but the court may stay the same after a hearing upon a motion therefor, and may impose such conditions as it may deem proper as to giving a bond and keeping the necessary accounts or otherwise to secure a restitution of the excess charges, if any, made during the pendency of the appeal in case the order appealed from should be sustained, revised, or modified in whole or in part.
