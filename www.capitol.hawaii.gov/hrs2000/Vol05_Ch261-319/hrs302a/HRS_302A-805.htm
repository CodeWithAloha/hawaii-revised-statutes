All licenses issued by the department shall be renewable every five years, if the licensee continues to satisfy the board's licensing standards.  All credentials issued by the department shall be renewable every year, up to a maximum of three years, if the credential holder continues to satisfy the board's credentialing standards and actively pursues appropriate licensing.  For the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years only, the board may, on a case-by-case basis, extend a credential for one year, but no more than twice for any credential holder; provided that the individual seeking an extension meets the following requirements and submits a written request to the board consisting of:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Evidence of strong teaching performance according to the board's performance standards; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Likelihood of successful implementation of the credential holder's proposed action plan. [L 1996, c 89, pt of §2; am L 1997, c 195, §3; am L 2000, c 106, §2]</P>
