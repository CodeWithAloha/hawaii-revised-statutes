<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§302A-1183  New century charter schools; request for establishment and designation.</B>  (a)  As an alternative to section 302A-1182(b), any community, group of teachers, or any program within an existing school may submit a letter of intent to the board for the establishment of a new century charter school.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The authors of the letter of intent shall then develop a detailed implementation plan, pursuant to section 302A-1182(c); provided that the plan shall also include the appointment of an interim school board, address issues of personnel management, and align any funding for the design and construction costs of building or renovating the new century charter school with the state facilities plan.  The superintendent shall provide support and guidance to the community in formulating a detailed implementation plan which is compliant with sections 302A-1182(c) and 302A-1184.  Once completed, the detailed implementation plan shall be submitted to the board for review.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The board shall have sixty days to review the completed implementation plan for the proposed new century charter school to ensure its compliance with sections 302A-1182(c) and 302A-1184.  Unless the board finds that the plan conflicts with section 302A-1182(c) or 302A-1184, the governor, the superintendent, and the board shall issue a charter designating the proposed new century charter school as a new century charter school within sixty days, and the proposed implementation plan shall be converted into a written performance contract between the school and the board.  The interim local school board shall establish the local school board pursuant to section 302A-1182(b) no later than ninety days after the governor, the superintendent, and the board have designated the school a new century charter school by charter.  If, within sixty days after the submission of the plan, the board finds a conflict with section 302A-1182(c) or 302A-1184, it shall notify the authors of the letter of intent of the finding in writing to enable the authors of the letter of intent to appropriately amend the plan to resolve the conflict.
