The director shall provide the partnership at least sixty days' written notice of intent to revoke the statement.  The notice shall be mailed to the partnership at its last known address appearing in the records of the director.  The notice shall specify the annual report that has not been filed or the fee that has not been paid, and the effective date of the revocation.  The revocation shall not be effective if the specified annual report is filed and the specified fee is paid before the effective date of the revocation.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Revocation under subsection (a) shall only affect a partnership's status as a limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership and shall not be deemed an event of dissolution of the partnership.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A partnership whose statement of qualification or statement of foreign qualification has been revoked may apply to the director for reinstatement within two years after the effective date of the revocation.  The application shall state:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The name of the partnership and the effective date of the revocation; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;That the ground for revocation either did not exist or has been corrected.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  A reinstatement under subsection (c) shall relate back to and take effect as of the effective date of the revocation, and the partnership's status as a limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership shall continue upon reinstatement as if the revocation had never occurred.
