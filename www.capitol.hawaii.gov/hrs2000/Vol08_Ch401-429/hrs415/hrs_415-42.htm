<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Authorize distributions;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Approve or recommend to shareholders actions or proposals required by this chapter to be approved by shareholders;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Designate candidates for the office of director, for purposes of proxy solicitation or otherwise, or fill vacancies on the board of directors or any committee thereof;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Amend the bylaws;</P>

<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Authorize or approve the issuance or sale of, or any contract to issue or sell, shares or designate the terms of a series of class of shares;</P></DIR>

<P>provided that the board of directors having acted regarding general authorization for the issuance or sale of shares, or any contract therefor, and, in the case of a series, the designation thereof, may, pursuant to a general formula or method specified by the board by resolution or by adoption of a stock option or other plan, authorize a committee to fix the terms of any contract for the sale of the shares and to fix the terms upon which the shares may be issued or sold, including, without limitation, the price, the dividend rate, provisions for redemption, sinking fund, conversion, voting or preferential rights, and provisions for other features of a class of shares, or a series of a class of shares, with full power in the committee to adopt any final resolution setting forth all of the terms thereof and to authorize the statement of the terms of a series to be delivered to the director for filing under this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;Neither the designation of the committee, the delegation thereto of authority, nor action by the committee pursuant to such authority shall alone constitute compliance by any member of the board of directors, not a member of the committee in question, with the member's responsibility to act in good faith, in a manner the member reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, and with such care as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
