<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-5  Indemnification of officers, directors, employees, and agents.</B>  (a)  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:</P>
<P>&#9;"Agent" means any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or other agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of the predecessor corporation.</P>
<P>&#9;"Expenses" include, without limitation, attorney's fees and any expenses of a completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  A corporation shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) if that person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the person was unlawful.  The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A corporation shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor because that person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of the person's duty to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  To the extent that an agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding referred to in subsection (b) or (c), or in defending any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified by the corporation against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Any indemnification under subsection (b) or (c) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsection (b) or (c).  The determination shall be made (1) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (2) if a quorum is not obtainable, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the shareholders, or (4) by the court in which the proceeding is or was pending upon application made by the corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not the application by the agent, attorney, or other person is opposed by the corporation.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that the agent is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  The indemnification provided by this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders, or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in a person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and personal representatives of such a person.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  A corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation, against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in any such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against such liability under this section. Any such insurance may be procured from any insurance company designated by the board of directors, including any insurance company in which the corporation shall have an equity or other interest, through stock ownership or otherwise.</P>
<P>&#9;(i)  This section does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that person's capacity, though the person may also be an agent of the employer corporation as defined in subsection (a).  Nothing contained in this section shall limit any right to indemnification to which a trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary may be entitled by contract or otherwise.
