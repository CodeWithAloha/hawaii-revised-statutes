<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-81  Rights of dissenting shareholders.</B>  (a)  As used in this section:</P>
<P>&#9;"Dissenter" means a shareholder or beneficial owner who is entitled to and does assert dissenters' rights under section 415-80, and who has performed every act required up to the time involved for the assertion of such rights.</P>
<P>&#9;"Corporation" means the issuer of the shares held by the dissenter before the corporate action, or the successor by merger or consolidation of that issuer.</P>
<P>&#9;"Fair value" of shares means their value immediately before the effectuation of the corporate action to which the dissenter objects, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action unless the exclusion would be inequitable.</P>
<P>&#9;"Interest" means interest from the effective date of the corporate action until the date of payment, at the average rate currently paid by the corporation on its principal bank loans, or, if none, at such rate as is fair and equitable under all of the circumstances.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If a proposed corporate action which would give rise to dissenters' rights under section 415-80(a) is submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, the notice of meeting shall notify all shareholders that they have or may have a right to dissent and obtain payment for their shares by complying with the terms of this section, and shall be accompanied by a copy of sections 415-80 and 415-81 of this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If the proposed corporate action is submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, any shareholder who wishes to dissent and obtain payment for the shareholder's shares must file with the corporation, prior to the vote, a written notice of intention to demand that the shareholder be paid fair compensation for the shareholder's shares if the proposed action is effectuated and shall refrain from voting the shareholder's shares in approval of the action.  A shareholder who fails in either respect shall acquire no right to payment for the shareholder's shares under this section or section 415-80.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If the proposed corporate action is approved by the required vote at a meeting of shareholders, the corporation shall mail a further notice to all shareholders who gave due notice of intention to demand payment and who refrained from voting in favor of the proposed action.  If the proposed corporate action is to be taken without a vote of shareholders, the corporation shall send to all shareholders who are entitled to dissent and demand payment for their shares a notice of the adoption of the plan of corporate action.  The notice shall:  (1) state where and when a demand for payment must be sent and certificates of certificated shares must be deposited in order to obtain payment; (2) inform holders of uncertificated shares to what extent transfer of shares will be restricted from the time that demand for payment is received; (3) supply a form for demanding payment which includes a request for certification of the date on which the shareholder, or the person on whose behalf the shareholder dissents, acquired beneficial ownership of the shares; and (4) be accompanied by a copy of sections 415-80 and 415-81 of this chapter.  The time set for the demand and deposit shall not be less than thirty days from the mailing of the notice.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  A shareholder who fails to demand payment, or fails (in the case of certificated shares) to deposit certificates, as required by a notice pursuant to subsection (d) shall have no right under this section or section 415-80 to receive payment for the shareholder's shares.  If the shares are not represented by certificates, the corporation may restrict their transfer from the time of receipt of demand for payment until effectuation of the proposed corporate action, or the release of restrictions under the terms of subsection (f).  The dissenter shall retain all other rights of a shareholder until these rights are modified by effectuation of the proposed corporate action.</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(f)&#9;(1)  Within sixty days after the date set for demanding payment and depositing certificates, if the corporation has not effectuated the proposed corporate action and remitted payment for shares pursuant to paragraph (3), it shall return any certificates that have been deposited, and release uncertificated shares from any transfer restrictions imposed by reason of the demand for payment.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;When uncertificated shares have been released from transfer restrictions, and deposited certificates have been returned, the corporation may at any later time send a new notice conforming to the requirements of subsection (d), with like effect.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Immediately upon effectuation of the proposed corporate action, or upon receipt of demand for payment if the corporate action has already been effectuated, the corporation shall remit to dissenters who have made demand and (if their shares are certificated) have deposited their certificates the amount which the corporation estimates to be the fair value of the shares, with interest if any has accrued.  The remittance shall be accompanied by:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The corporation's closing balance sheet and statement of income for a fiscal year ending not more than sixteen months before the date of remittance, together with the latest available interim financial statements;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;A statement of the corporation's estimate of fair value of the shares; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;A notice of the dissenter's right to demand supplemental payment, accompanied by a copy of sections 415-80 and 415-81 of this chapter.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(g)&#9;(1)  If the corporation fails to remit as required by subsection (f), or if the dissenter believes that the amount remitted is less than the fair value of the dissenter's shares, or that the interest is not correctly determined, the dissenter may send the corporation the dissenter's own estimate of the value of the shares or of the interest, and demand payment of the deficiency.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If the dissenter does not file such an estimate within thirty days after the corporation's mailing of its remittance, the dissenter shall be entitled to no more than the amount remitted.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)&#9;(1)  Not more than sixty days after receiving a demand for payment pursuant to subsection (g), if any such demands for payment remain unsettled, the corporation shall file in an appropriate court a petition requesting that the fair value of the shares and interest thereon be determined by the court.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;An appropriate court shall be a court of competent jurisdiction in the county of this State where the principal office of the corporation is located.  If, in the case of a merger or consolidation or share exchange, the corporation is a foreign corporation without a principal office in this State, the petition shall be filed in the county where the registered office of the domestic corporation was last located.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;All dissenters, wherever residing, whose demands have not been settled shall be made parties to the proceeding as in an action against their shares.  A copy of the petition shall be served on each dissenter; if a dissenter is a nonresident, the copy may be served on the dissenter by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The jurisdiction of the court shall be plenary and exclusive.  The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value.  The appraisers shall have such power and authority as shall be specified in the order of their appointment or in any amendment thereof.  The dissenters shall be entitled to discovery in the same manner as parties in other civil suits.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;All dissenters who are made parties shall be entitled to judgment for the amount by which the fair value of their shares is found to exceed the amount previously remitted, with interest.</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;If the corporation fails to file a petition as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, each dissenter who made a demand and who has not already settled the dissenter's claim against the corporation shall be paid by the corporation the amount demanded by the dissenter, with interest, and may sue therefor in an appropriate court.</P>
<P>&#9;(i)&#9;(1)  The costs and expenses of any proceeding under subsection (h), including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court, shall be determined by the court and assessed against the corporation, except that any part of the costs and expenses may be apportioned and assessed as the court may deem equitable against all or some of the dissenters who are parties and whose action in demanding supplemental payment the court finds to be arbitrary, vexatious, or not in good faith.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Fees and expenses of counsel and of experts for the respective parties may be assessed as the court may deem equitable against the corporation and in favor of any or all dissenters if the corporation failed to comply substantially with the requirements of this section, and may be assessed against either the corporation or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in respect to the rights provided by this section and section 415-80.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and should not be assessed against the corporation, it may award to these counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded to the dissenters who were benefitted.</P>
<P>&#9;(j)&#9;(1)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the corporation may elect to withhold the remittance required by subsection (f) from any dissenter with respect to shares of which the dissenter (or the person on whose behalf the dissenter acts) was not the beneficial owner on the date of the first announcement to news media or to shareholders of the terms of the proposed corporate action.  With respect to such shares, the corporation shall, upon effectuating the corporate action, state to each dissenter its estimate of the fair value of the shares, state the rate of interest to be used (explaining the basis thereof), and offer to pay the resulting amounts on receiving the dissenter's agreement to accept them in full satisfaction.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If the dissenter believes that the amount offered is less than the fair value of the shares and interest determined according to this section, the dissenter may within thirty days after the date of mailing of the corporation's offer, mail to the corporation the dissenter's own estimate of fair value and interest, and demand their payment.  If the dissenter fails to do so, the dissenter shall be entitled to no more than the corporation's offer.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If the dissenter makes a demand as provided in paragraph (2), the provisions of subsections (h) and (i) shall apply to further proceedings on the dissenter's demand. [L 1983, c 167, pt of §1; am L 1985, c 270, §4; gen ch 1985; am L 1987, c 135, §56; am L 1988, c 373, §4]</P>
