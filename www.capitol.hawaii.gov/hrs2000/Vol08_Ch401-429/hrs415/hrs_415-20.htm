<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-20  Stock rights and options.</B>  Subject to any provisions in respect thereof set forth in its articles of incorporation, a corporation may create and issue, whether or not in connection with the issuance and sale of any of its shares or other securities, rights or options entitling the holders thereof to purchase from the corporation shares of any class or classes.  Such rights or options shall be evidenced in such manner as the board of directors shall approve and, subject to the provisions of the articles of incorporation, shall set forth the terms upon which, the time or times within which, and the price or prices at which, such shares may be purchased from the corporation upon the exercise of any right or option.  If such rights or options are to be issued to directors, officers, or employees of the corporation or of any subsidiary thereof, and not to the shareholders generally, their issuance shall be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon or shall be authorized by and consistent with a plan approved or ratified by a vote of shareholders.  In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the board of directors as to the adequacy of the consideration received for such rights or options shall be conclusive.  The documents evidencing such rights or options may include conditions on the exercise of such rights or options, including conditions that preclude the holder or holders, including any subsequent transferees, of at least a specified percentage of the common shares of a corporation from exercising such rights or options.
