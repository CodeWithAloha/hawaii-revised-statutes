The commissioner shall not conduct such examinations of holding companies unless the commissioner has good cause to believe that a holding company is experiencing financial adversity which will have a material negative impact on the safety and soundness of its financial institution subsidiary.  The cost of such examinations shall be assessed against and paid by the financial institution holding company in the same manner as financial institutions under section 412:2-105.
