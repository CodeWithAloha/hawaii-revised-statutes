<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§412:13-230]  Seizure of foreign bank's property and business; liquidation.</B>  (a)  If the commissioner finds that any of the factors set forth in section 412:13-228 are true with respect to any foreign bank that is licensed to establish and maintain a Hawaii state branch or Hawaii state agency and that it is necessary for the protection of the interests of the creditors of the foreign bank's business in this State, or for the protection of the public interest that a conservator or receiver take immediate possession of the property and business of the foreign bank, the commissioner, by order, may appoint a conservator or receiver forthwith to take possession of the property and business of the foreign bank in this State and retain possession until the foreign bank resumes business in this State or is finally liquidated.  The provisions of part IV of article 2 of this chapter, to the extent applicable, shall govern the procedures for appointment of the conservator or receiver, any judicial proceedings arising from the appointment, and the duties and powers of the conservator or receiver.  The foreign bank, with the consent of the commissioner, may resume business in this State upon any conditions as the commissioner may prescribe by rule or order.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Whenever a conservator or receiver takes possession of the property and business of a foreign bank pursuant to subsection (a), the conservator or receiver shall conserve or liquidate the property and business of the foreign bank pursuant to the laws of this State as if the foreign bank were a Hawaii state bank, with absolute preference and priority given to the creditors of the foreign bank arising out of transactions with, and recorded on the books of, its Hawaii state branch or Hawaii state agency over the creditors of the foreign bank's offices located outside this State.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Whenever a receiver has completed the liquidation of the property and business of a foreign bank, the receiver shall transfer any remaining assets to the foreign bank in accordance with the orders as the court may issue.  However, in case the foreign bank has an office in another state of the United States that is in liquidation and the assets of that office appear to be insufficient to pay in full the creditors of that office, the court shall order the receiver to transfer to the liquidator of that office the amount of any remaining assets as appears to be necessary to cover the insufficiency; if there are two or more offices and the amount of remaining assets is less than the aggregate amount of insufficiencies with respect to the offices, the court shall order the receiver to distribute the remaining assets among the liquidators of the offices in a manner as the court finds equitable.
