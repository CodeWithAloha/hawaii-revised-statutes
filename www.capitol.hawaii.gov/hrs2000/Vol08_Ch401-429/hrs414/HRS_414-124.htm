<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§414-124]  Action without meeting.</B>  (a)  Action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action.  The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed before or after the intended effective date of the action by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action, and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If not otherwise fixed under section 414-123 or 414-127, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting is the date the first shareholder signs the consent under subsection (a).</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A consent signed under this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If this chapter requires that notice of proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by unanimous consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation must give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the proposed action at least ten days before the action is taken.  The notice must contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under this chapter, would have been required to be sent to nonvoting shareholders in a notice of meeting at which the proposed action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.
