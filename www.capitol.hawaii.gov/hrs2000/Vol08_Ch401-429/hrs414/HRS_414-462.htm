<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§414-462]  Procedure for and effect of revocation.</B>  (a)  If the department director determines that one or more grounds exist under section 414-461 for revocation of a certificate of authority, the department director shall give written notice of the department director's determination by mailing the notice to the foreign corporation at its last known address appearing in the records of the department director.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If the foreign corporation does not correct each ground for revocation or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the department director that each ground determined by the department director does not exist within sixty days after the date of mailing of the department director's written notice, the department director may revoke the foreign corporation's certificate of authority by signing a certificate of revocation that recites the ground or grounds for revocation and its effective date.  The department director shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the foreign corporation under section 414-440.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The authority of a foreign corporation to transact business in this State ceases on the date shown on the certificate revoking its certificate of authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The department director's revocation of a foreign corporation's certificate of authority appoints the department director the foreign corporation's agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action that arose during the time the foreign corporation was authorized to transact business in this State.  Service of process on the department director under this subsection is service on the foreign corporation.  Upon receipt of process, the department director shall mail a copy of the process to the secretary of the foreign corporation at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or in any subsequent communication received from the corporation stating the current mailing address of its principal office, or, if none are on file, in its application for a certificate of authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Revocation of a foreign corporation's certificate of authority does not terminate the authority of the registered agent of the corporation. [L 2000, c 244, pt of §1]</P>
