<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§80-11  Working hours of employees reporting to central pick-up point.</B>  The working day of any employee of the State and the several counties or any agency or instrumentality thereof, who is required to report for duty at a corporation yard or any other central pick-up point, shall commence at the time the employee is required to report for duty at the corporation yard or central pick-up point and shall cease upon the employee's return to the point at the end of the work period.</P>
<P>&#9;Employees of the state departments of accounting and general services and transportation and of the department of public works of any county shall be entitled to an allowance of travel time when they are required to report for duty to points any significant distance away from home or their usual place of employment in the vicinity in which they live.</P>
<P>&#9;Every department head of these departments shall establish rules and regulations governing the determination of a pick-up point for an employee required to work on projects or other place of employment which is not the employee's regular and permanent place of employment, including an employee who is assigned to and is required to report for duty on a public highway for maintenance work or other project, and shall allow travel time to the employee based primarily upon the additional time, if any, reasonably required for the employee to travel from the employee's home to the place where the employee is to report for duty instead of going from the employee's home to the appropriate central office, base yard, or other regular and fixed quarters of the department which is nearest the employee's home.  The department head, in establishing the rules and regulations, shall take into consideration the following factors:  the distance between the employee's home and the job site; the estimated time required for traveling; the convenience of the government; and the reasonableness and fairness to the employee.
