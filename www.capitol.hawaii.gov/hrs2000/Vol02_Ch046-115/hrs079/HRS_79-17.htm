The officer or employee, while serving the other government on a loan basis during the officer's or employee's leave of absence, shall retain membership and all rights in the public service and in the employees' retirement system as though the officer or employee had remained in the service of the State or of any county thereunder; provided that the officer or employee return to the officer's or employee's former position within ninety days after the termination of the officer's or employee's contract with the other government.  Upon the officer's or employee's return from the loan to state or county employment, as the case may be, the officer or employee shall be reinstated to the position the officer or employee left and shall be entitled to such compensation as the officer or employee would have then been entitled had the officer or employee remained in the service of the State or any county thereunder.</P>
<P>&#9;No officer or employee participating in the loan program shall hold the State or any of the counties under the State liable for any compensation for work performed for another government while on loan from the State during the leave of absence, nor for any transportation costs incurred in proceeding to and returning from the loan employment destination.
