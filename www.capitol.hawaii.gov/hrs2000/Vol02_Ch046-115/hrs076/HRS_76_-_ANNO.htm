<P>  The law is further revised as superseded by the provisions of the county charters.</P>

<P>  Because the procedure outlined in §76-2 is limited in its application to interpretations of this chapter and chapter 77, the constitutionality of any provision of the two chapters is an issue beyond the bounds of that process.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</P>
