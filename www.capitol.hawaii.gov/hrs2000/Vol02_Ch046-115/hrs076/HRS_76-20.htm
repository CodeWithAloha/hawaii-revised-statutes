<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§76-20  Open-competitive examinations.</B>  Examinations shall be open-competitive whenever in the opinion of the director of human resources development they are for the best advantage of the public service.  In making such determination, the director shall take into consideration the sufficiency of competition within civil service as well as the requirements of the class for which the examinations are to be conducted.  Ample notice shall be given by the director of the fact that any open-competitive examination is to be conducted.  The director may, if the director deems it necessary because of lack of sufficient competition or any other reason, extend the time for the filing of applications.
