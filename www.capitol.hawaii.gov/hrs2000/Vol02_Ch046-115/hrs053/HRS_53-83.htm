<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§53-83]  Powers of county.</B>  Any county which pursuant to section 53-81 shall directly rather than through an agency exercise the powers conferred upon an agency by parts I and II of this chapter shall have all powers granted to an agency under such parts, and the provisions of such parts shall be applicable to the county in the exercise of such powers as though the county constituted an agency thereunder.  However, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall be subject to the following:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(8)&#9;The county shall possess all powers granted by section 53-11 to an instrumentality of the government with the same force and effect as though the county were not directly performing the functions of an agency under this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;The bonds referred to in paragraph (5) of section 53-11 shall include bonds issued by the county to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</P>

<P>    (15)&#9;The approval by the council of any plan or project authorized in section 53-20 shall not require any concurrency, including by the officer or department administering or performing the functions of the county under this part.</P>
<P>    (16)&#9;The provisions of [subsection] (b) of section 53-22 shall be inapplicable; provided that nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to prohibit the county from advancing for the purposes of this part moneys other than redevelopment moneys or funds, or from reimbursing itself from redevelopment moneys or funds so advanced, or from issuing its bonds as provided in this part.</P>
<P>    (17)&#9;The words the "agency, the county" where used in the second sentence of section 53-53 shall mean and refer to the county.</P>
<P>    (18)&#9;The second sentence of section 53-54 shall be construed as meaning that the county may delegate to any other public body any of the powers or functions of the county with respect to the planning or undertaking of an urban renewal project in the area in which such public body is authorized to act, and such other public body may carry out or perform such powers or functions for the county.
