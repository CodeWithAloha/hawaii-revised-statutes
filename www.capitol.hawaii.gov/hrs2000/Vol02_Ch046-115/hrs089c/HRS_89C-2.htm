For section effective July 1, 2002, see below.]</I>  Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the compensation, hours, terms, and conditions of employment, amounts of contributions by the State and respective counties to the Hawaii public employees health fund, and other benefits for public officers and employees who are excluded from collective bargaining shall be adjusted by the chief executives of the State or counties, the board of education, the board of regents, the auditor, the director of the legislative reference bureau, the ombudsman, or the chief justice, as applicable.  The chief executives, the board of education, the board of regents, the auditor, the director of the legislative reference bureau, the ombudsman, and the chief justice, or their designated representatives, shall determine the adjustments to be made and which excluded officers or employees are to be granted adjustments under this chapter, in accordance with the following guidelines and limitations:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;For excluded officers and employees under the same compensation plans as officers and employees within collective bargaining units, such adjustments shall be not less than those provided under collective bargaining agreements for officers and employees hired on a comparable basis.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;For excluded officers and employees in the excluded managerial compensation plan, such adjustments shall be not less than those provided under collective bargaining to officers and employees in the professional and scientific employees bargaining unit.  Alternate adjustments may be granted to officers and employees whose work is related to that of officers and employees in the other optional bargaining units in order to maintain appropriate pay relationships with such officers and employees.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;No adjustment in compensation, hours, terms, and conditions of employment, amounts of contributions by the State and respective counties to the Hawaii public employees health fund, or other benefits shall be established which is in conflict with the system of personnel administration based on merit principles and scientific methods governing the classification of positions and the employment conduct, movement, and separation of public officers and employees.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The compensation of officers or employees whose salaries presently are limited or fixed by legislative enactment shall not be adjusted under this chapter, but shall continue to be adjusted by the appointing authority within limits established by law or by legislative enactment.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The compensation of officers or employees, who are not covered under the same compensation plans as officers and employees within collective bargaining units and whose salaries presently are authorized to be fixed by the appointing authority, need not be adjusted under this chapter.  The appointing authority may continue to make specific adjustments in the salaries of individual officers or employees from available funds appropriated.</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Adjustments to the amounts of contributions by the State and respective counties to the Hawaii public employees health fund on behalf of officers or employees who are not covered by adjustments made under this chapter shall be made by legislative enactment. [L 1978, c 197, pt of §2; am L 1982, c 152, §2 and c 159, pt of §1(1); am L 1984, c 254, §6; am L 1987, c 30, §1]</P>

<P>&#9;<B>§89C-2  Adjustments authorized; limitations, restrictions.</B>  <I>[Section effective July 1, 2002.  For present provision, see above.]</I>  Each appropriate authority may make adjustments for their respective excluded employees subject to the following guidelines and limitations:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The compensation of excluded employees, whose pay is presently limited or fixed by legislative action, shall not be adjusted under this chapter and shall continue to be limited or fixed by the respective legislative body;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The compensation of excluded employees exempt from civil service coverage, whose pay is set at the discretion of the appointing authority, shall continue to be adjusted at the discretion of the appointing authority from funds allowed for this purpose;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Any adjustment made for excluded civil service employees shall be consistent with the merit principle and shall not diminish any rights provided under chapter 76;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;For excluded employees under the same classification systems as employees within collective bargaining units, adjustments shall be not less than those provided under collective bargaining agreements for employees hired on a comparable basis;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;For excluded employees other than those under paragraph (4), adjustments shall, to the extent practicable, uniformly apply to every excluded employee within a homogeneous grouping, such as, cabinet members or managerial employees, to ensure fairness.  This does not preclude variable adjustments based on performance or other job criteria and specific adjustments warranted based on the nature of work performed or working conditions; and</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;No adjustment shall be made in benefits provided under chapter 88 unless specifically authorized by that chapter, or with respect to any other matter that the legislature may specifically prohibit or limit by law.
