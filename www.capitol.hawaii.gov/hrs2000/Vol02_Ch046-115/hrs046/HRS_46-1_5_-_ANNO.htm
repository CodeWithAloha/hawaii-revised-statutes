<P>  Public utilities commission's regulatory powers over public utilities preempted power of counties to regulate height of utility poles.  72 H. 285, 814 P.2d 398.</P>
<P>  Counties' general power of eminent domain as set out in paragraph (6) not limited by §§46-61, 46-62, and 101-2; when a municipal ordinance may be preempted pursuant to paragraph (13), discussed.  76 H. 46, 868 P.2d 1193.</P>
<P>  Financial responsibility law was not preempted by chapter 294, part I (chapter 294 is predecessor to chapter 431, article 10C), where plaintiff’s preemption theories were grounded in §70-105 (predecessor to §46-1.5(13)).   76 H. 209, 873 P.2d 88.</P>
<P>  Where city ordinance did not require that funds generated by a "convicted persons" charge be used to defray the city’s investigative and prosecutorial costs associated with the individual payor’s case, leaving open the possibility that the charge could be used for general revenue raising purposes, ordinance was not a "service fee" under paragraph (8), but a tax, which the State did not empower the city to impose; thus ordinance was invalid.  89 H. 361, 973 P.2d 736.</P>
