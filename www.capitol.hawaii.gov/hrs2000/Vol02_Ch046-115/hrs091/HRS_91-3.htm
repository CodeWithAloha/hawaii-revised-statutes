<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;A statement of the topic of the proposed rule adoption, amendment, or repeal or a general description of the subjects involved; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;A statement that a copy of the proposed rule to be adopted, the proposed rule amendment, or the rule proposed to be repealed will be mailed to any interested person who requests a copy, pays the required fees for the copy and the postage, if any, together with a description of where and how the requests may be made;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;A statement of when, where, and during what times the proposed rule to be adopted, the proposed rule amendment, or the rule proposed to be repealed may be reviewed in person; and</P>

</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;The notice shall be mailed to all persons who have made a timely written request of the agency for advance notice of its rulemaking proceedings, given at least once statewide for state agencies and in the county for county agencies.  Proposed state agency rules shall also be posted on the Internet as provided in section 91-2.6; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Afford all interested persons opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, orally or in writing.

Upon adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency, if requested to do so by an interested person, shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its determination.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an agency finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or morals, or to livestock and poultry health, requires adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule upon less than thirty days' notice of hearing, and states in writing its reasons for such finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon such abbreviated notice and hearing, including posting the abbreviated notice and hearing on the Internet as provided in section 91-2.6, as it finds practicable to adopt an emergency rule to be effective for a period of not longer than one hundred twenty days without renewal.</P>

The adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule by any county agency shall be subject to the approval of the mayor of the county.

<P>&#9;(d)  The requirements of subsection (a) may be waived by the governor in the case of the State, or by the mayor in the case of a county, whenever a state or county agency is required by federal provisions to adopt rules as a condition to receiving federal funds and the agency is allowed no discretion in interpreting the federal provisions as to the rules required to be adopted; provided that the agency shall make the adoption, amendment, or repeal known to the public by:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Giving public notice of the substance of the proposed rule at least once statewide prior to the waiver of the governor or the mayor; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Posting the full text of the proposed rulemaking action on the Internet as provided in section 91-2.6.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  No adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule shall be invalidated solely because of:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The inadvertent failure to mail an advance notice of rulemaking proceedings;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The inadvertent failure to mail or the nonreceipt of requested copies of the proposed rule to be adopted, the proposed rule amendment, or the rule proposed to be repealed; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The inadvertent failure on the part of a state agency to post on the website of the office of the lieutenant governor all proposed rulemaking actions of the agency and the full text of the agency's proposed rules as provided in section 91-2.6.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Any challenge to the validity of the adoption, amendment, or repeal of an administrative rule on the ground of noncompliance with statutory procedural requirements shall be forever barred unless the challenge is made in a proceeding or action, including an action pursuant to section 91-7, that is begun within three years after the effective date of the adoption, amendment, or repeal of the rule.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Whenever an agency seeks only to repeal one or more sections, chapters, or subchapters of the agency's rules because the rules are either null and void or unnecessary, and not adopt, amend, or compile any other rules:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The agency shall give thirty days' public notice at least once statewide of the proposed date of repeal and of:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;A statement of when, where, and during what times the sections, chapters, or subchapters proposed to be repealed may be reviewed in person;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The agency shall post the full text of the proposed sections, chapters, or subchapters to be repealed on the Internet as provided in section 91-2.6; and</P>
