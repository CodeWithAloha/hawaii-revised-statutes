</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  For purposes of subsection (b):</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the information; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by section 490:9-512, 490:9-514, or 490:9-518, is an initial financing statement.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  A record that is communicated to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection (b), is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record from the files.
