However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after this article takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before this article takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Subsection (c)(2) applies to a financing statement that, before this article takes effect, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in the former section 490:9-103 only to the extent that part 3 provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before this article takes effect and a continuation statement filed after this article takes effect is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of part 5 for an initial financing statement.
