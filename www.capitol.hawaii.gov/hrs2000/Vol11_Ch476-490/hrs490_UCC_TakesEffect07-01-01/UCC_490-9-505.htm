<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§490:9-505  Filing and compliance with other statutes and treaties for consignments, leases, other bailments, and other transactions.</B>  <I>[Section effective July 1, 2001.  For section effective until June 30, 2001, see the main volume and 1999 supplement of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.]  </I>(a)  A consignor, lessor, or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in section 490:9-311(a), using the terms "consignor", "consignee", "lessor", "lessee", "bailor", "bailee", "licensor", "licensee", "owner", "registered owner", "buyer", "seller", or words of similar import, instead of the terms "secured party" and "debtor".</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (a) and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under section 490:9-311(b), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation.  If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance. [L 2000, c 241, pt of §1]</P>
