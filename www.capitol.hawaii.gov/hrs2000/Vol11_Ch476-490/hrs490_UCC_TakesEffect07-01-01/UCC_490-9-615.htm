<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The satisfaction of obligations secured by any subordinate security interest in or other subordinate lien on the collateral if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The secured party receives from the holder of the subordinate security interest or other lien an authenticated demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;In a case in which a consignor has an interest in the collateral, the subordinate security interest or other lien is senior to the interest of the consignor; and</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  A secured party need not apply or pay over for application noncash proceeds of disposition under this section unless the failure to do so would be commercially unreasonable.

</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(f)  The surplus or deficiency following a disposition is calculated based on the amount of proceeds that would have been realized in a disposition complying with this part to a transferee other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The transferee in the disposition is the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of proceeds that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(g)  A secured party that receives cash proceeds of a disposition in good faith and without knowledge that the receipt violates the rights of the holder of a security interest or other lien that is not subordinate to the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made:</P><DIR>
