<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§490:9-506  Effect of errors or omissions.</B>  <I>[Section effective July 1, 2001.  For section effective until June 30, 2001, see the main volume and 1999 supplement of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.]  </I>(a)  A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 490:9-503(a) is seriously misleading.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 490:9-503(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  For purposes of section 490:9-508(b), the "debtor's correct name" in subsection (c) means the correct name of the new debtor. [L 2000, c 241, pt of §1]</P>
