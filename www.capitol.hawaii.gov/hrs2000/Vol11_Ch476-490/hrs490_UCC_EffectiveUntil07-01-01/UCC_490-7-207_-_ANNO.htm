<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Sections 22 and 23, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Consolidated and revised; holders of overissued receipts permitted to share in mass of fungible goods.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  No change of substance is made other than the explicit statement that holders to whom overissued receipts have been duly negotiated shall share in a mass of fungible goods.  Where individual ownership interests are merged into claims on a common fund, as is necessarily the case with fungible goods, there is no policy reason for discriminating between successive purchasers of similar claims.</P>
