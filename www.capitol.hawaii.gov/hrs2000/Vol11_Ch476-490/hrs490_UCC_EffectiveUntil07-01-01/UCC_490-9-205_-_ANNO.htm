<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  None.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  This Article expressly validates the floating charge or lien on a shifting stock.  (See Sections 9-201, 9-204, and Comment to Section 9-204.)  This Section provides that a security interest is not invalid or fraudulent by reason of liberty in the debtor to dispose of the collateral without being required to account for proceeds or substitute new collateral.  It repeals the rule of Benedict v. Ratner, 268 U.S. 353, 45 S.Ct. 566, 69 L.Ed. 991 (1925), and other cases which held such arrangements void as a matter of law because the debtor was given unfettered dominion or control over the collateral.  The principal effect of the Benedict rule has been, not to discourage or eliminate security transactions in inventory and accounts receivable - on the contrary such transactions have vastly increased in volume - but rather to force financing arrangements in this field toward a self-liquidating basis.  Furthermore several Circuit Court cases drew implications from Justice Brandeis' opinion in Benedict v. Ratner which have required lenders operating in this field to observe a number of needless and costly formalities for example it has been thought necessary for the debtor to make daily remittances to the lender of all collections received, even though the amount remitted is immediately returned to the debtor in order to keep the loan at an agreed level.</P>
<P>  2.  The Benedict rule has, in the accounts receivable field, been repealed in many of the state accounts receivable statutes which have been enacted since 1943, and, in the inventory field, by some of the factor's lien statutes.  (Benedict v. Ratner purported to state the law of New York and not a rule of federal bankruptcy law.  Since its acceptance is a matter of state law, it can of course be rejected by state statute.)</P>
<P>  3.  The requirement of "policing" is the substance of the Benedict rule.  While this Section repeals Benedict in matters of form, the filing requirements (Section 9-302) give other creditors the opportunity to ascertain from public sources whether property of their debtor or prospective debtor is subject to secured claims, and the provisions about proceeds (Section 9-306(4)) enable creditors to claim collections which were made by the debtor more than 10 days before insolvency proceedings and commingled or deposited in a bank account before institution of the insolvency proceedings.  The repeal of the Benedict rule under this Section must be read in the light of these provisions.</P>
<P>  4.  Other decisions reaching results like that in the Benedict case, but relating to other aspects of dominion (of which Lee v. State Bank &amp; Trust Co., 54 F.2d 518 (2d Cir. 1931), is an example) are likewise rejected.</P>
<P>  5.  Nothing in Section 9-205 prevents such "policing" or dominion as the secured party and the debtor may agree upon; business and not legal reasons will determine the extent to which strict accountability, segregation of collections, daily reports and the like will be employed.</P>
<P>  6.  The last sentence is added to make clear that the Section does not mean that the holder of an unfiled security interest, whose perfection depends on possession of the collateral by the secured party or by a bailee (such as a field warehouseman), can allow the debtor access to and control over the goods without thereby losing his perfected interest.  The common law rules on the degree and extent of possession which are necessary to perfect a pledge interest or to constitute a valid field warehouse are not relaxed by this or any other section of this Article.</P>
