<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Sections 3 and 8(1), Uniform Trust Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Revised to conform to the scheme of this Article.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  For most types of property, filing and taking possession are alternative methods of perfection.  For some types of intangibles (i.e., accounts, contract rights and general intangibles) filing is the only available method (see Section 9-305 and point 1 of Comment thereto).  With respect to instruments subsection (1) provides that, except for the cases of "temporary perfection" covered in subsections (4) and (5), taking possession is the only available method; this provision follows the Uniform Trust Receipts Act.  The rule is based on the thought that where the collateral consists of instruments, it is universal practice for the secured party to take possession of them in pledge; any surrender of possession to the debtor is for a short time; therefore it would be unwise to provide the alternative of perfection for a long period by filing which, since it in no way corresponds with commercial practice, would serve no useful purpose.  Subsection (1) further provides that filing is available as a method of perfection for security interests in chattel paper and negotiable documents, which also come within Section 9-305 on perfection by possession.  Chattel paper is sometimes delivered to the assignee, sometimes left in the hands of the assignor for collection; subsection (1) allows the assignee to perfect his interest by filing in the latter case.  Negotiable documents may be, and usually are, delivered to the secured party; subsection (1) follows the Uniform Trust Receipts Act in allowing filing as an alternative method of perfection.  Perfection of an interest in a non-negotiable document is covered in subsection (3).</P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (2), following prior law and consistently with the provisions of Article 7, takes the position that, so long as a negotiable document covering goods is outstanding, title to the goods is, so to say, locked up in the document and the proper way of dealing with such goods is through the document.  Perfection therefore is to be made with respect to the document and, when made, automatically carries over to the goods.  Any interest perfected directly in the goods while the document is outstanding (for example, a chattel mortgage on goods in a warehouse) is subordinated to an outstanding negotiable document.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsection (3) takes a different approach to the problem of goods covered by a non-negotiable document or otherwise in the possession of a bailee who has not issued a negotiable document.  Here title to the goods is not looked on as being locked up in the document and the secured party may perfect his interest directly in the goods by filing as to them.  The subsection states two other methods of perfection:  issuance of the document in the secured party's name (as consignee of a straight bill of lading or the person to whom delivery would be made under a non- negotiable warehouse receipt) and receipt of notification of the secured party's interest by the bailee which, under Section 9-305, is looked on as equivalent to taking possession by the secured party.</P>
<P>  4.  Subsections (4) and (5) follow the Uniform Trust Receipts Act in giving perfected status to security interests in instruments and documents for a short period although there has been no filing and the collateral is in the debtor's possession.  The period of 21 days is chosen to conform to the provisions of Section 60 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.  There are a variety of legitimate reasons - some of them are described in subsections (5)(a) and (5)(b) - why such collateral has to be temporarily released to a debtor and no useful purpose would be served by cluttering the files with records of such exceedingly short term transactions.  Under subsection (4) the 21 day perfection runs from the date of attachment; there is no limitation on the purpose for which the debtor is in possession but the secured party must have given new value under a written security agreement.  Under subsection (5) the 21 day perfection runs from the date a secured party who already has a perfected security interest turns over the collateral to the debtor (an example is a bank which has acquired a bill of lading by honoring drafts drawn under a letter of credit and subsequently turns over the bill of lading to its customer); there is no new value requirement but the turnover must be for one or more of the purposes stated in subsections (5)(a) and (5)(b).  Note that while subsection (4) is restricted to instruments and negotiable documents, subsection (5) extends to goods covered by non-negotiable documents as well.  Thus the letter of credit bank referred to in the example could make a subsection (5) turn-over without regard to the form of the bill of lading, provided that, in the case of a non-negotiable document, it had previously perfected its interest under one of the methods stated in subsection (3).</P>
