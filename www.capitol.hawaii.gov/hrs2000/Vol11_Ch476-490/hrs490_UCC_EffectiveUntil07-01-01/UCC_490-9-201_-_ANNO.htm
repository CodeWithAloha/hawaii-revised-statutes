</B><P>  This section states the general validity of a security agreement.  In general the security agreement is effective between the parties; it is likewise effective against third parties.  Exceptions to this general rule arise where there is a specific provision in any Article of this Act, for example, where Article 1 invalidates a disclaimer of the obligations of good faith, etc.  (Section 1-102(3)), or this Article subordinates the security interest because it has not been perfected (Section 9-301) or for other reasons (see Section 9-312 on priorities) or defeats the security interest where certain types of claimants are involved (for example Section 9-307 on buyers of goods).  As pointed out in the Note to Section 9-102, there is no intention that the enactment of this Article should repeal retail installment selling acts or small loan acts.  Nor of course are the usury laws of any state repealed.  These are mentioned in the text of Section 9-201 as examples of applicable laws, outside this Code entirely, which might invalidate the terms of a security agreement.</P>
