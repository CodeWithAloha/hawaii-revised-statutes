<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  None.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  In a variety of situations two or more people may claim an interest in the same property.  The several sections listed in subsection (1) state rules for determining priorities between security interests and such other claims in the situations covered in those sections.  For cases not covered in those sections this Section states general rules of priority between conflicting security interests.</P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (2) gives priority to a new value security interest in crops based on a current crop production loan over an earlier security interest in the crop which secured obligations (such as rent, interest or mortgage principal amortization) due more than six months before the crops become growing crops.  This priority is not affected by the fact that the person making the crop loan knew of the earlier security interest.  Section 9-204(4)(a) should be consulted on the extent to which this Article permits a security interest to attach to crops planted after the execution of the security agreement.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsections (3) and (4) give priority to a purchase money security interest (defined in Section 9-107) under certain conditions over non-purchase money interests, which in this context will usually be interests asserted under after-acquired property clauses.  See Section 9-204(3) and (4) on the extent to which after-acquired property interests are validated and Section 9-108 on when a security interest in after-acquired property is deemed taken for new value.</P>
<P>  Prior law, under one or another theory, usually contrived to protect purchase money interests over after-acquired property interests (to the extent to which the after-acquired property interest was recognized at all).  For example, in the field of industrial equipment financing it was possible, by manipulation of title theory, for the purchase money financer of new equipment (under conditional sale or equipment trust) to protect himself against the claims of prior mortgagees or bondholders under an after-acquired clause in the mortgage or trust indenture the result was arrived at on the theory that since "title" to the equipment was never in the vendee or lessee there was nothing for the lien of the mortgage to attach to.  While this Article broadly validates the after-acquired property interest, it also recognizes as sound the preference which prior law gave to the purchase money interest.  That policy is carried out in subsections (3) and (4).</P>
<P>  Subsection (4) states a general rule applicable to all types of collateral except inventory the purchase money interest takes priority provided only that it is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the collateral or within ten days thereafter.  As to the ten day grace period, compare Section 9-301(2).  The perfection requirement means that the purchase money secured party either has filed a financing statement before that time or has a temporarily perfected interest in goods covered by documents under Section 9-304(4) and (5) (which is continued in a perfected status by filing before the expiration of the 21 day period specified in that section).  There is no requirement that the purchase money secured party be without notice or knowledge of the other interest; he takes priority although he knows of it or it has been filed.</P>
<P>  Under subsection (3) the same rule of priority, but without the ten day grace period for filing, applies to a purchase money security interest in inventory with the additional requirement that the purchase money secured party give notification, as stated in subsections (3)(b) and (3)(c), to any other secured party of whom he knows or who was the first to file and who is also interested in the same item or type of inventory.  The reason for the additional requirement of notification is that typically the arrangement between an inventory secured party and his debtor will require the secured party to make periodic advances against incoming inventory or periodic releases of old inventory as new inventory is received.  A fraudulent debtor may apply to the secured party for advances even though he has already given a security interest in the inventory to another secured party.  The notification requirement protects the inventory financer in such a situation if he has received notification, he will presumably not make an advance; if he has not received notification (or if the other interest does not qualify as a purchase money interest), any advance he may make will have priority.  Since an arrangement for periodic advances against incoming property is unusual outside the inventory field, no notification requirement is included in subsection (4).</P>
<P>  4.  Subsection (5) states rules for determining priority between conflicting security interests in cases not covered in the sections listed in subsection (1) or in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section.  Note that subsection (5) applies to cases of purchase money security interests which do not qualify for the special priorities set forth in subsections (3) and (4).</P>
<P>  The operation of subsections (5) and (6) is illustrated by the following examples.</P>
<P>  <B>Example</B> <B>1.</B>  A files against X (debtor) on February&nbsp;1.  B files against X on March&nbsp; 1.  B makes a non-purchase money advance against certain collateral on April&nbsp;1.  A makes an advance against the same collateral on May&nbsp;1.  A has priority even though B's advance was made earlier and was perfected when made.  It makes no difference whether or not A knew of B's interest when he made his advance.</P>
<P>  The problem stated in the example is peculiar to a notice filing system under which filing may be made before the security interest attaches (see Section 9-402).  The Uniform Trust Receipts Act, which first introduced such a filing system, contained no hint of a solution and case law under it has been unpredictable.  This Article follows several of the accounts receivable statutes in determining priority by order of filing.  The justification for the rule lies in the necessity of protecting the filing system - that is, of allowing the secured party who has first filed to make subsequent advances without each time having, as a condition of protection, to check for filings later than his.  Note, however, that his protection is not absolute if, in the example, B's advance creates a purchase money security interest, he has priority under subsection (4), or, in the case of inventory, under subsection (3) provided he has properly notified A.  (See further Example 3 below.)</P>
<P>  <B>Example</B> <B>2.</B>  A and B make non-purchase money advances against the same collateral.  The collateral is in the debtor's possession and neither interest is perfected when the second advance is made.  Whichever secured party first perfects his interest (by taking possession of the collateral or by filing) takes priority and it makes no difference whether or not he knows of the other interest at the time he perfects his own.</P>
<P>  Subsections (5)(a) and (5)(b) both lead to this result.  It may be regarded as an adoption, in this type of situation, of the idea, deeply rooted at common law, of a race of diligence among creditors.  Subsection (5)(c) adds the thought that so long as neither of the interests is perfected, the one which first attached (i.e., under the advance first made) has priority.  The last mentioned rule may be thought to be of merely theoretical interest, since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation without either A or B having perfected his interest.  If neither interest had been perfected at the time of the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, of course neither would be good against the trustee in bankruptcy.</P>
<B><P> </B> <B>Example</B> <B>3.</B>  A has a temporarily perfected (21 day) security interest, unfiled, in a negotiable document in the debtor's possession under Section 9-304(4) or (5).  On the fifth day B files and thus perfects a security interest in the same document.  On the tenth day A files.  A has priority, whether or not he knows of B's interest when he files.</P>
<P>  The result follows from subsection (6) which classifies security interests according to the manner of their initial perfection.  The case therefore falls under subsection (5)(b) and not under (5)(a); A prevails because his interest was first perfected although B was first to file.</P>
<P>  <B>Example</B> <B>4.</B>  On February&nbsp;1 A makes an advance against machinery in the debtor's possession and files his financing statement.  On March&nbsp;1 B makes an advance against the same machinery and files his financing statement.  On April&nbsp;1 A makes a further advance, under the original security agreement, against the same machinery (which is covered by the original financing statement and thus perfected when made).  A has priority over B both as to the February&nbsp;1 and as to the April&nbsp;1 advance and it makes no difference whether or not A knows of B's intervening advance when he makes his second advance.</P>
<P>  The case falls under subsection (5)(a), since both interests are perfected by filing.  A wins, as to the April&nbsp;1 advance, because he first filed even though B's interest attached, and indeed was perfected, first.  Section 9-204(5) and the Comment thereto should be consulted for the validation of future advances.  Section 9-313 provides for cases involving fixtures.</P>
<P>  <B>Example</B> <B>5.</B>  On February&nbsp;1 A makes advances to X under a security agreement which covers "all the machinery in X's plant" and contains an after-acquired property clause.  A promptly files his financing statement.  On March 1&nbsp;X acquires a new machine, B makes an advance against it and files his financing statement.  On April&nbsp;1 A, under the original security agreement, makes an advance against the machine acquired March&nbsp;1.  If B's advance creates a purchase money security interest, he has priority under subsection (4) (provided he filed before X received possession of the machine or within ten days thereafter).  If B's advance, although he gave new value, did not create a purchase money interest, A has priority for the reasons stated under Example 4.</P>
