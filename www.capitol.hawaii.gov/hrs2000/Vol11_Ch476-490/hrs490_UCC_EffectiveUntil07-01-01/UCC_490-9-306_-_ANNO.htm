<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 10, Uniform Trust Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Modified and rewritten.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  To state a secured party's right to the proceeds received by a debtor on disposition of collateral and to state when his interest in such proceeds is perfected.</P>
<P>  2.  Changes from Prior Law:</P>
<P>  (a)  Whether a debtor's sale of collateral was authorized or unauthorized, prior law generally gave the secured party a claim to the proceeds.  Sometimes it was said that the security interest attached to the "property" received in substitution; sometimes it was said the debtor held the proceeds as "trustee" or "agent" for the secured party.  Whatever the formulation of the rule, the secured party, if he could trace the proceeds, could reclaim them or their equivalent from the debtor or his trustee in bankruptcy.  The change in existing law made by this Section relates to non-identifiable cash proceeds; the secured party has, under conditions stated in subsection (4)(d), a security interest in the debtor's cash and bank accounts equal to the amount of cash proceeds received and commingled or deposited within the 10 days before insolvency proceedings were instituted less the amount of cash proceeds received by the debtor and paid over to the secured party during that period, without regard to whether or not the funds are identifiable as cash proceeds of the collateral.</P>
<P>  (b)  Subsections (2) and (3) make clear that the four-month period for calculating a voidable preference in bankruptcy begins with the date of the secured party's obtaining the security interest in the original collateral and not with the date of his obtaining control of the proceeds.  The interest in the proceeds "continues" as a perfected interest if the original interest was perfected; but the interest ceases to be perfected after the expiration of ten days unless the financing statement covering the original collateral covered the proceeds or unless the secured party perfects his interest in the proceeds themselves - i.e., by filing a financing statement covering them or by taking possession.</P>
<P>  (c)  Where cash proceeds are covered into the debtor's checking account and paid out in the operation of the debtor's business, recipients of the funds of course take free of any claim which the secured party may have in them as proceeds.  What has been said relates to payments and transfers in ordinary course.  The law of fraudulent conveyances would no doubt in appropriate cases support recovery of proceeds by a secured party from a transferee out of ordinary course or otherwise in collusion with the debtor to defraud the secured party.</P>
<P>  3.  In most cases when a debtor makes an unauthorized disposition of collateral, the security interest, under prior law and under this Article, continues in the original collateral in the hands of the purchaser or other transferee.  That is to say, since the transferee takes subject to the security interest, the secured party may repossess the collateral from him or in an appropriate case maintain an action for conversion.  Subsection (2) codifies this rule.  The secured party may claim both proceeds and collateral, but may of course have only one satisfaction.</P>
<P>  In many cases a purchaser or other transferee of collateral will take free of a security interest:  in such cases the secured party's only right will be to proceeds.  The transferee will take free whenever the disposition was authorized; the authorization may be contained in the security agreement or otherwise given.  A claim to proceeds in a filed financing statement might be considered as impliedly authorizing sale or other disposition of the collateral, depending upon the circumstances of the parties, the nature of the collateral, the course of dealing of the parties and the usage of trade (see Section 1-205).  Section 9-301 states when transferees take free of unperfected security interests.  Sections 9-307 on goods, 9-308 on chattel paper and non-negotiable instruments and 9-309 on negotiable instruments, negotiable documents and securities state when purchasers of such collateral take free of a security interest even though perfected and even though the disposition was not authorized.</P>
<P>  4.  Subsection (5) states rules to determine priorities when collateral which has been sold is returned to the debtor:  for example goods returned to a department store by a dissatisfied customer.  The most typical problems involve sale and return of inventory, but the subsection can also apply to equipment.  Under the rule of Benedict v. Ratner, failure to segregate such returned goods sometimes led to invalidation of the entire security arrangement.  This Article rejects the Benedict v. Ratner line of cases (see Section 9-205 and Comment).  Subsection (5)(a) of this Section reinforces the rule of Section 9-205:  as between secured party and debtor (and debtor's trustee in bankruptcy) the original security interest continues on the returned goods.  Whether or not the security interest in the returned goods is perfected depends upon factors stated in the text.</P>
<P>  Subsections (5)(b), (c) and (d) deal with a different aspect of the returned goods situation.  Assume that a dealer has sold an automobile and transferred the chattel paper or the account arising on the sale to Bank X (which had not previously financed the car as inventory).  Thereafter the buyer of the automobile rightfully rescinds the sale, say for breach of warranty, and the car is returned to the dealer.  Subsection (5)(b) gives the bank as transferee of the chattel paper or the account a security interest in the car against the dealer.  For protection against the dealer's creditors or purchasers from him (other than buyers in the ordinary course of business, see Section 9-307), Bank X as the transferee, under subsection (5)(d), must perfect its interest by taking possession of the car or by filing as to it.  Perfection of his original interest in the chattel paper or the account does not automatically carry over to the returned car, as it does under subsection (5)(a) where the secured party originally financed the dealer's inventory.</P>
<P>  In the situation covered by (5)(b) and (5)(c) a secured party who financed the inventory and a secured party to whom the chattel paper or the account was transferred may both claim the returned goods - the inventory financer under subsection (5)(a), the transferee under subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c).  With respect to chattel paper, Section 9-308 regulates the priorities.  With respect to an account, subsection (5)(c) subordinates the security interest of the transferee of the account to that of the inventory financer.  However, if the inventory security interest was unperfected, the transferee's interest could become entitled to priority under the rules stated in Section 9-312(5).</P>
<P>  In cases of repossession by the dealer and also in cases where the chattel was returned to the dealer by the voluntary act of the account debtor, the dealer's position may be that of a mere custodian; he may be an agent for resale, but without any other obligation to the holder of the chattel paper; he may be obligated to repurchase the chattel, the chattel paper or the account from the secured party or to hold it as collateral for a loan secured by a transfer of the chattel paper or the account.</P>
<P>  If the dealer thereafter sells the chattel to a buyer in ordinary course of business in any of the foregoing cases, the buyer is fully protected under Section 2-403(2) as well as under Section 9-307(1), whichever is technically applicable.</P>
