<P>  <B>Purposes:</B>  To adopt and extend somewhat the principle of the statutes which provide for suit by the real party in interest.  The provisions of this section apply only after identification of the goods.  Prior to that time only the seller has a right of action.  During the period between identification and final acceptance (except in the case of revocation of acceptance) it is possible for both parties to have the right of action.  Even after final acceptance both parties may have the right of action if the seller retains possession or otherwise retains an interest.</P>
