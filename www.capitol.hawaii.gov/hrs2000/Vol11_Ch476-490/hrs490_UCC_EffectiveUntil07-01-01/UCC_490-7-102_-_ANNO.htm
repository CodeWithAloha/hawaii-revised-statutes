<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Sections 1 and 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Applicable definitions from the uniform acts have been consolidated and revised; definition of delivery order is new.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</P>
</B><P>  1.  "Bailee" was not defined in the old uniform acts.  It is used in this Article as a blanket term to designate carriers, warehousemen and others who normally issue documents of title on the basis of goods which they have received.  The definition does not, however, require actual possession of the goods.  If a bailee acknowledges possession when he does not have it he is bound by sections of this Article which declare the "bailee's" obligations.  (See definition of "Issuer" in this section and Sections 7-203 and 7-301 on liability in case of non-receipt.)</P>
<P>  2.  The definition of warehouse receipt contained in the general definitions section of this Act (Section 1-201) eliminates the requirement of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act that the issuing warehouseman be "lawfully engaged" in business.  The warehouseman's compliance with applicable state regulations such as the filing of a bond has no bearing on the substantive issues dealt with in this Article.  Certainly the issuer's violations of law should not diminish his responsibility on documents he has put in commercial circulation.  The Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act requirement that the warehouseman be engaged "for profit" has also been eliminated in view of the existence of state operated and co-operative warehouses.  But it is still essential that the business be storing goods "for hire" (Section 1-201 and this section).  A person does not become a warehouseman by storing his own goods.</P>
<P>  3.  Delivery orders, which were included without qualification in the Uniform Sales Act definition of document of title, must be treated differently in this consolidation of provisions from the three uniform acts.  When a delivery order has been accepted by the bailee it is for practical purposes indistinguishable from a warehouse receipt.  Prior to such acceptance there is no basis for imposing obligations on the bailee other than the ordinary obligation of contract which the bailee may have assumed to the depositor of the goods.</P>
