</B><P>  The rights and duties of the parties to a security transaction and of third parties are stated in this Article without reference to the location of "title" to the collateral.  Thus the incidents of a security interest which secures the purchase price of goods are the same under this Article whether the secured party appears to have retained title or the debtor appears to have obtained title and then conveyed it or a lien to the secured party.  This Article in no way determines which line of interpretation (title theory v. lien theory or retained title v. conveyed title) should be followed in cases where the applicability of some other rule of law depends upon who has title.  Thus if a revenue law imposes a tax on the "legal" owner of goods or if a corporation law makes a vote of the stockholders prerequisite to a corporation "giving" a security interest but not if it acquires property "subject" to a security interest, this Article does not attempt to define whether the secured party is a "legal" owner or whether the transaction "gives" a security interest for the purpose of such laws.  Other rules of law or the agreement of the parties determine the location of "title" for such purposes.</P>
<P>  Petitions for reclamation brought by a secured party in his debtor's insolvency proceedings have often been granted or denied on a title theory; where the secured party has title, reclamation will be granted; where he has "merely a lien", reclamation may be denied.  For the treatment of such petitions under this Article, see Point 1 of Comment to Section 9-507.</P>
