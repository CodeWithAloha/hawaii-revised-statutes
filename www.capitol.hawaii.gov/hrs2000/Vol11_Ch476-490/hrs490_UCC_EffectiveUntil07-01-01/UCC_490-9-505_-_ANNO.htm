<P>  <B>Purposes</B> <B>of</B> <B>Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Experience has shown that the parties are frequently better off without a resale of the collateral; hence this section sanctions an alternative arrangement.  In lieu of resale or other disposition, the secured party may propose under subsection (2) that he keep the collateral as his own, thus discharging the obligation and abandoning any claim for a deficiency.  This right may not be exercised in the case of consumer goods where the debtor has paid 60% of the price or obligation and thus has a substantial equity, and may be exercised in other cases only on notification to the debtor and other secured parties who have filed in this state or are otherwise known to the secured party exercising the right, and on failure of anyone receiving notification to object within thirty days.</P>
<P>  2.  When an objection is received by the secured party he must then proceed to dispose of the collateral in accordance with Section 9-504, and on failure to do so would incur the liabilities set out in Section 9-507.  In the case of consumer goods where 60% of the price or obligation has been paid the disposition must be made within 90 days after possession taken.  For failure to make the sale within the 90 day period the secured party is liable in conversion or alternatively may incur the liabilities set out in Section 9-507.</P>
<P>  3.  After default (but not before) a consumer-debtor who has paid 60% of the cash price may sign a written renunciation of his rights to require resale of the collateral.</P>
