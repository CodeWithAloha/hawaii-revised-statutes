<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </B>Subsection (1) - Section 1(1) and (2), Uniform Sales Act; Subsection (2) - none, but subsection generally continues policy of Sections 11, 44 and 69, Uniform Sales Act; Subsecti</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>o</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>ns (3) and (4) - none.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:  </B>Completely rewritten.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Subsection (1):  "Contract for sale" is used as a general concept throughout this Article, but the rights of the parties do not vary according to whether the transaction is a present sale or a contract to sell unless the Article expressly so provides.</P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (2):  It is in general intended to continue the policy of requiring exact performance by the seller of his obligations as a condition to his right to require acceptance. However, the seller is in part safeguarded against surprise as a result of sudden technicality on the buyer's part by the provisions of Section 2-508 on seller's cure of improper tender or delivery.  Moreover usage of trade frequently permits commercial leeways in performance and the language of the agreement itself must be read in the light of such custom or usage and also, prior course of dealing, and in a long term contract, the course of performance.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsections (3) and (4):  These subsections are intended to make clear the distinction carried forward throughout this Article between termination and cancellation.</P>
