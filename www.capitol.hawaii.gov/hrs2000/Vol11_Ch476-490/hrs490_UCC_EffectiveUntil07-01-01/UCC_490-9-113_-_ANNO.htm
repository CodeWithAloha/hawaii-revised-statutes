<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Under the provisions of Article 2 on Sales, a seller of goods may reserve a security interest (see, e.g., Sections 2-401 and 2-505); and in certain circumstances, whether or not a security interest is reserved, the seller has rights of resale and stoppage under Sections 2-703, 2-705 and 2-706 which are similar to the rights of a secured party.  Similarly, under such sections as Sections 2-506, 2-707 and 2-711, a financing agency, an agent, a buyer or another person may have a security interest or other right in goods similar to that of a seller.  The use of the term "security interest" in the Sales Article is meant to bring the interests so designated within this Article.  This Section makes it clear, however, that such security interests are exempted from certain provisions of this Article.  Compare Section 4-208(3), making similar special provisions for security interests arising in the bank collection process.</P>
<P>  2.  The security interests to which this Section applies commonly arise by operation of law in the course of a sale transaction.  Since the circumstances under which they arise are defined in the Sales Article, there is no need for the "security agreement" defined in Section 9-105(1)(h) and required by Sections 9-203(1)(b) and 9-204(1), and paragraph (a) dispenses with such requirements.  The requirement of filing may be inapplicable under Sections 9-302(1)(a) and (b), 9-304 and 9-305, where the goods are in the possession of the secured party or of a bailee other than the debtor.  To avoid difficulty in the residual cases, as for example where a bailee does not receive notification of the secured party's interest until after the security interest arises, paragraph (b) dispenses with any filing requirement.  Finally, paragraph (c) makes inapplicable the default provisions of Part 5 of this Article, since the Sales Article contains detailed provisions governing stoppage of delivery and resale after breach.  See Sections 2-705, 2-706, 2-707(2) and 2-711(3).</P>
<P>  3.  These limitations on the applicability of this Article to security interests arising under the Sales Article are appropriate only so long as the debtor does not have or lawfully obtain possession of the goods.  Compare Section 56(b) of the Uniform Sales Act.  A secured party who wishes to retain a security interest after the debtor lawfully obtains possession must comply fully with all the provisions of this Article and ordinarily must file a financing statement to perfect his interest.  This is the effect of the "except" clause in the preamble to this Section.  Note that in the case of a buyer who has a security interest in rejected goods under Section 2-711(3), the buyer is the "secured party" and the seller is the "debtor".</P>
<P>  4.  This Section applies only to a "security interest".  The definition of "security interest" in Section 1-201(37) expressly excludes the special property interest of a buyer of goods on identification under Section 2-401(1).  The seller's interest after identification and before delivery may be more than a security interest by virtue of explicit agreement under Section 2-401(1) or 2-501(1), by virtue of the provisions of Section 2-401(2), (3) or (4), or by virtue of substitution pursuant to Section 2-501(2).  In such cases, Article 9 is inapplicable by the terms of Section 9-102(1)(a).</P>
<P>  5.  Where there is a "security interest", this Section applies only if the security interest arises "solely" under the Sales Article.  Thus Section 1-201(37) permits a buyer to acquire by agreement a security interest in goods not in his possession or control; such a security interest does not impair his rights under the Sales Article, but any rights based on the security agreement are fully subject to this Article without regard to the limitations of this Section.  Similarly, a seller who reserves a security interest by agreement does not lose his rights under the Sales Article, but rights other than those conferred by the Sales Article depend on full compliance with this Article.</P>
