<P>  <B>Prior</B> <B>Uniform</B> <B>Statutory</B> <B>Provision:</B>  Subsection (1):  Section 76, Uniform Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</P>
</B><P>  The definitions of "buyer" and "seller" have been slightly rephrased, the reference in Section 76 of the prior Act to "any legal successor in interest of such person" being omitted.  The definition of "receipt" is new.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes</B> <B>of</B> <B>Changes</B> <B>and</B> <B>New</B> <B>Matter:</P>
</B><P>  1.  The phrase "any legal successor in interest of such person" has been eliminated since Section 2-210 of this Article, which limits some types of delegation of performance on assignment of a sales contract, makes it clear that not every such successor can be safely included in the definition.  In every ordinary case, however, such successors are as of course included.</P>
<P>  2.  "Receipt" must be distinguished from delivery particularly in regard to the problems arising out of shipment of goods, whether or not the contract calls for making delivery by way of documents of title, since the seller may frequently fulfill his obligations to "deliver" even though the buyer may never "receive" the goods.  Delivery with respect to documents of title is defined in Article 1 and requires transfer of physical delivery.  Otherwise the many divergent incidents of delivery are handled incident by incident.</P>
