<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </B>Section 14, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 17, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:  </B>General Revision.  Principal innovations include:  affirmation of bailee's privilege to deliver to claimant without resort to judicial proceedings if the bailee acts in good faith and is willing to take the full risk of loss in case the lost document turns up in the hands of an innocent purchaser; explicit authorization to the court to order bailee to issue a substitute document rather than make physical delivery of the goods; inclusion of "stolen" as well as lost documents; extension of section to non-negotiable documents.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:  </B>The purposes of the changes insofar as they are not self-evident are as follows:</P>
<P>  1.  As to bailee's privilege to deliver without court order, doubt had arisen as to the propriety of such action under Section 54 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, which made it a crime to deliver goods covered by negotiable receipts without taking up the receipts "except in the cases provided for in Section 14" (the lost receipts section).  This has been interpreted by one court as exempting from criminal liability only if the judicial procedure of Section 14 was followed.  Dahl v. Winter-Truesdell- Diercks Co., 61 N.D. 84, 237 N.W. 202 (1931).  Although the criminal provisions are not being re-enacted in this Act (and the Uniform Bills of Lading Act never did include such a criminal provision), it seems advisable to clarify the legality of the well established commercial practice of bailees to make delivery where they are satisfied that the claimant is the person entitled under a lost document.  Since the bailee remains liable on the document in such cases, he will usually insist that the claimant provide an indemnity bond.</P>
<P>  2.  The old acts provide only for compulsory delivery of goods; this Section provides also for compulsory issuance of a substitute document.  If continuance of the bailment is desirable there is no reason to require the goods to be withdrawn and redeposited in order to secure a negotiable document.  The present acts would probably be so interpreted.  Section 20 of the Federal Warehouse Act and some state laws expressly require issuance of a new receipt on proof of loss and posting of bond.</P>
<P>  3.  Claimants on non-negotiable instruments are permitted to avail themselves of this procedure because straight bills of lading sometimes contain provisions that the goods shall not be delivered except upon production of the bill.  If the carrier should choose to insist upon production of the bill, the consignee should have some means of compelling delivery on satisfactory proof of entitlement.</P>
<P>  Ordinarily no security would be necessary to indemnify a bailee in delivering to the person named in a non-negotiable document.  But disputes as to negotiability may arise, in which case if there is a reasonable doubt on the point the bailee should be protected against the possibility that the missing document would, in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value, be held negotiable.</P>
<P>  4.  It seems unnecessary to state, as do the present acts, that the court shall act "on satisfactory proof of such loss or destruction."  The right of action created by the section is conditioned on a document being lost, stolen or destroyed.  Plaintiff must of course bring himself within the section.  There is nothing in the language of the old acts to suggest that they intended to impose anything but the normal burden of proof on the plaintiff in such proceedings.</P>
<P>  5.  Subsection (2) makes it clear that after delivery without court order the bailee remains liable for actual damages.  Liability for conversion is provided where the delivery is dishonest, but excluded where a filed classification or tariff is followed in good faith, or where the described bond is posted in good faith and no classification or tariff is filed.  Liability for conversion in other cases is left to judicial decision.</P>
