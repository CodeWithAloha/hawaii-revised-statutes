<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 4, Uniform Trust Receipts Act; Sections 6 and 7, Uniform Conditional Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Under chattel mortgage acts, the Uniform Conditional Sales Act and other conditional sales legislation the geographical unit for filing or recording was local:  the county or township in which the mortgagor or vendee resided or in which the goods sold or mortgaged were kept.  The Uniform Trust Receipts Act used the state as the geographical filing unit:  under that Act statements of trust receipt financing were filed with an official in the state capital and were not filed locally.  The state-wide filing system of the Trust Receipts Act has been followed in many accounts receivable and factor's lien acts.</P>
<P>  Both systems have their advocates and both their own advantages and drawbacks.  The principal advantage of state-wide filing is ease of access to the credit information which the files exist to provide.  Consider for example the national distributor who wishes to have current information about the credit standing of the thousands of persons he sells to on credit.  The more completely the files are centralized on a state-wide basis, the easier and cheaper it becomes to procure credit information; the more the files are scattered in local filing units, the more burdensome and costly.  On the other hand, it can be said that most credit inquiries about local businesses, farmers and consumers come from local sources; convenience is served by having the files locally available and there is no great advantage in centralized filing.</P>
<P>  This Section does not attempt to resolve the controversy between the advocates of a completely centralized state-wide filing system and those of a large degree of local autonomy.  Instead the Section is drafted in a series of alternatives; local considerations of policy will determine the choice to be made.</P>
<P>  2.  Fortunately there is general agreement that the proper filing place for security interests in fixtures is in the office where a mortgage on the real estate concerned would be filed or recorded, and subsection (1)(a) in the First Alternative and subsection (1)(b) in the Second and Third Alternatives so provide.  This provision follows the Uniform Conditional Sales Act.  Note that there is no requirement for an additional filing with the chattel records.</P>
<P>  3.  In states where it is felt wise to preserve local filing for transactions of essentially local interest, either the Second or Third Alternatives of subsection (1) should be adopted.  Subsection (1)(a) in both alternatives provides county (township, etc.) filing for consumer goods transactions and for agricultural transactions (farm equipment, farm products, farm accounts and crops).  Note that the subsection departs from Section 6 of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act and adopts instead the policy of many chattel mortgage acts in selecting the county of the debtor's residence, rather than the county where the goods are located, as the normal filing place.  Where, however, the debtor is an out-of-state resident the filing must of necessity be in the county where the goods are, and the subsection so provides.  Though not expressly stated, it is evident that filing for an assignment of accounts arising from the sale of farm products by a farmer who is not a resident must be in the county where the debtor keeps his farm products.  In the case of crops, where the land is in one county and the debtor's residence in another, filing must be made in both counties.  The policy of the subsection is to require filing in the place or places where a creditor would normally look for information concerning interests created by the debtor.</P>
<P>  4.  It is thought that sound policy requires a state-wide filing system for all transactions except the essentially local ones covered in subsection (1)(a) of the Second and Third Alternatives and transactions involving fixtures covered in subsection (1)(b) of the Second and Third Alternatives.  Subsection (1)(c) so provides in both alternatives, as does subsection (1)(b) in the First Alternative.  In a state which has adopted either the Second or Third Alternative, central filing would be required when the collateral was any kind of goods except consumer goods, farm equipment or farm products (including crops); documents; chattel paper; and accounts, contract rights and general intangibles, unless related to a farm.  Note that the filing provisions of this article do not apply to instruments (see Section 9-304).</P>
<P>  If the Third Alternative subsection (1) is adopted, then local filing, in addition to the central filing, is required in all the cases stated in the preceding paragraph, with respect to any debtor whose places of business within the state are all within a single county (township, etc.) or a debtor who is not engaged in business.</P>
<P>  In states where the arguments for a completely centralized set of files (except for fixtures) prevail, the First Alternative subsection (1) should be adopted.  That alternative provides for exclusive central filing of all security interests except those in fixtures.</P>
<P>  5.  When a secured party has in good faith attempted to comply with the filing requirements but has not done so correctly, subsection (2) makes his filing effective in so far as it was proper, and also makes it good for all collateral covered by the financing statement against any person who actually knows the contents of the improperly filed statement.  The subsection rejects the occasional decisions that an improperly filed record is ineffective to give notice even to a person who knows of it.  But if the Third Alternative subsection (1) is adopted, the requirements of subsection (1)(c) are not complied with unless there is filing in both offices specified; filing in only one of two required places is not effective except as against one with actual knowledge.</P>
<P>  6.  Subsection (3) deals with change of residence or place of business or the location or use of the goods after a proper filing has been made.  The subsection is important only when local filing is required, and covers only changes between local filing units in the State.  For changes of location between states see Section 9-103(3).</P>
<P>  Subsection (3) is presented in alternative forms.  Under the first no new filing is required in the county to which the collateral has been removed.  Under alternative subsection (3) the original filing lapses four months after the change in location; this is the same rule that is applied by Section 9-103(3) to the case of collateral brought into the state subject to a security interest which attached elsewhere.</P>
