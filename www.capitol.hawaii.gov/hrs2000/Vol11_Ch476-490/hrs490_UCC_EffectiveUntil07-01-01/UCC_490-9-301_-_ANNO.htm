<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Sections 8(2) and 9(2)(b), Uniform Trust Receipts Act; Section 5, Uniform Conditional Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Changed in substance.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  This Section lists the classes of persons who take priority over an unperfected security interest.  As in Section 60 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, the term "perfected" is used to describe a security interest in personal property which cannot be defeated in insolvency proceedings or in general by creditors.  A security interest is "perfected" when the secured party has taken whatever steps are necessary to give him such an interest.  These steps are explained in the five following sections (9-302 through 9-306).</P>
<P>  2.  Section 9-312 states general rules for the determination of priorities among conflicting security interests and in addition contains a list of other sections which state special rules of priority in a variety of situations.  The interests given priority under Section 9-312 and the other sections therein listed take such priority in general even over a perfected security interest.  A fortiori they take priority over an unperfected security interest, and subsection (1)(a) of this Section so states.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsection (1)(b) follows the Uniform Trust Receipts Act and Uniform Conditional Sales Act and the rule under some chattel mortgage legislation.  It provides that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to the rights of lien creditors who acquire their liens without knowledge of the prior security interest and before it is perfected.  The section rejects the rule, applied in many jurisdictions to chattel mortgages and in a few to conditional sales, that an unperfected security interest is subordinated to all creditors.  The section subordinates the unperfected security interest but does not subordinate the debt.</P>
<P>  4.  Subsections (1)(c) and (1)(d) deal with purchasers (other than secured parties) of collateral who would take subject to a perfected security interest but who are by these subsections given priority over an unperfected security interest.  In the cases of goods and of intangibles of the type whose transfer is effected by physical delivery of the representative piece of paper (instruments, documents and chattel paper) the purchaser who takes priority must both give value and receive delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the existing security interest and before perfection (subsection (1)(c)).  Thus even if the purchaser gave value without knowledge and before perfection, he would take subject to the security interest if perfection occurred before physical delivery of the collateral to him.  The subsection (1)(c) rule is obviously not appropriate where the collateral consists of intangibles and there is no representative piece of paper whose physical delivery is the only or the customary method of transfer.  Therefore with respect to such intangibles (accounts, contract rights and general intangibles), subsection (1)(d) gives priority to any transferee who has given value without knowledge and before perfection of the security interest.</P>
<P>  The term "buyer in ordinary course of business" referred to in subsection (1)(c) is defined in Section 1-201(9).</P>
<P>  Other secured parties are excluded from subsections (1)(c) and (1)(d) because their priorities are covered in Section 9-312 (see point 2 of this Comment).</P>
<P>  5.  Except to the extent provided in subsection (2) this Article does not permit a secured party to file or take possession after another interest has received priority under subsection (1) and thereby protect himself against the intervening interest.</P>
<P>  A few chattel mortgage statutes did have grace periods, i.e., a filing within x days after the mortgage was given related back to the day the mortgage was given.  The Uniform Conditional Sales Act had a ten-day period which cut off all intervening interests.  The Uniform Trust Receipts Act had a thirty-day period but did not cut off the interest of a purchaser who took delivery before the filing.</P>
<P>  Subsection (2) gives a grace period for perfection by filing as to purchase money security interests only (that term is defined in Section 9-107).  The grace period runs for ten days after the collateral comes into possession of the debtor but operates to cut off only the interests of intervening lien creditors or bulk purchasers.</P>
<P>  6.  Subsection (3) defines "lien creditor", following in substance the provisions of the Uniform Trust Receipts Act.</P>
