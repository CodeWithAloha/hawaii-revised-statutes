<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 34, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Rewritten and expanded to define the warehouseman's right to terminate the storage not only where the goods are perishable or hazardous as in Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, Section 34, but also for any other reason including decline in value of the goods imperilling the warehouseman's security for charges.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Most warehousing is for an indefinite term, the bailor being entitled to delivery on reasonable demand.  It is necessary to define the warehouseman's power to terminate the bailment, since it would be commercially intolerable to allow warehousemen to order removal of the goods on short notice.  The thirty day period provided where the document does not carry its own period of termination corresponds to commercial practice of computing rates on a monthly basis.  The right to terminate under subsection (1) includes a right to require payment of "any charges", but does not depend on the existence of unpaid charges.</P>
<P>  2.  In permitting expeditious disposition of perishable and hazardous goods Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, Section 34, made no distinction between cases where the warehouseman knowingly undertook to store such goods and cases where the goods were discovered to be of that character subsequent to storage.  The former situation presents no such emergency as justifies the summary power of removal and sale.  Subsections (2) and (3) distinguish between the two situations.</P>
<P>  3.  Protection of his lien is the only interest which the warehouseman has to justify summary sale of perishable goods which are not hazardous.  This same interest must be recognized when the stored goods, although not perishable, decline in market value to a point which threatens the warehouseman's security.</P>
<P>  4.  The right to order removal of stored goods is subject to provisions of the public warehousing laws of some states forbidding warehousemen from discriminating among customers.  Nor does the section relieve the warehouseman of any obligation under the state laws to secure the approval of a public official before disposing of deteriorating goods.  Such regulatory statutes and the regulations under them remain in force and operative.  Sections 7-103, 10-103.</P>
