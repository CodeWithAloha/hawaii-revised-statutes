<P>&#9;(b)  Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (a)(2), whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.</P>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court that a lease contract was made, but the lease contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;With respect to goods that have been received and accepted by the lessee.</P></DIR>
