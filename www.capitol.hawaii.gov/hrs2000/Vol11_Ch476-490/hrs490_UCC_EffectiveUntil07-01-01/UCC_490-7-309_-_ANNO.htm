<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </B>Section 3, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:  </B>Consolidated and rewritten.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  The old uniform act provided that bills of lading could not contain terms impairing the obligation of reasonable care.  Whether this is violated by a stipulation that in case of loss the bailee's liability is limited to stated amounts has been much controverted.  For interstate rail transportation the matter is settled by the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act (See 49 U.S.C.A. Sec. 20(11)).  The present section is a generalized version of the Interstate Commerce Act provisions.  The obligation of due care is radically qualified, in the case of maritime bills and international airbills, by federal legislation and treaty.  All this special legislation would remain in effect even if Congress enacts this Code, including the present Article.  See Section 7-103.</P>
<P>  Subsection (1) does not impair any rule of law imposing the liability of an insurer on a common carrier in intrastate commerce.  Subsection (2), however, applies to such liability as well as to liability based on negligence.  The entire section is subject under Section 7-103 to applicable provisions in filed tariffs, such as the common disclaimer of responsibility for undeclared articles of extraordinary value, hidden from view.  Tariffs which lawfully provide a maximum unit value beyond which goods are not taken fall within the same principle, and are expressly covered by the words "value as lawfully provided in the tariff."</P>
