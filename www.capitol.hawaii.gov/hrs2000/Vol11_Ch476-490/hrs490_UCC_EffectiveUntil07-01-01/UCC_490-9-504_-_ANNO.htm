<P>  <B>Purposes</B> <B>of</B> <B>Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  The Uniform Trust Receipts Act provides that an entruster in possession after default holds the collateral with the rights and duties of a pledgee, and, in particular, that he may sell such collateral at public or private sale with a right to claim deficiency and a duty to account for any surplus.  The Uniform Conditional Sales Act insisted on a sale at public auction with elaborate provisions for the giving of notice of sale.  This Section follows the more liberal provisions of the Trust Receipts Act.  Although public sale is recognized, it is hoped that private sale will be encouraged where, as is frequently the case, private sale through commercial channels will result in higher realization on collateral for the benefit of all parties.  The only restriction placed on the secured party's method of disposition is that it must be commercially reasonable.  In this respect this Section follows the provisions of the Section on resale by a seller following a buyer's rejection of goods (Section 2-706).  Subsection (1) does not restrict disposition to sale:  the collateral may be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of - subject of course to the general requirement of subsection (2) that all aspects of the disposition be "commercially reasonable".  Section 9-507(2) states some tests as to what is "commercially reasonable".</P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (1) in general follows prior law in its provisions for the application of proceeds and for the debtor's right to surplus and liability for deficiency.  Under subsection (1)(c) the secured party, after paying expenses of retaking and disposition and his own debt, is required to pay over remaining proceeds to the extent necessary to satisfy the holder of any junior security interest in the same collateral if the holder of the junior interest has made a written demand and furnished on request reasonable proof of his interest:  this provision is necessary in view of the fact that under subsection (4) the junior interest is discharged by the disposition.  Since the requirement is conditioned on written demand it should not result in undue burden on the secured party making the disposition.  It should be noted also that under Section 9-112 where the secured party knows that the collateral is owned by a person who is not the debtor, the owner of the collateral and not the debtor is entitled to any surplus.</P>
<P>  3.  In any security transaction the debtor (or the owner of the collateral if other than the debtor:  see Section 9-112) is entitled to any surplus which results from realization on the collateral; the debtor will also, unless otherwise agreed, be liable for any deficiency.  Subsection (2) so provides.  Since this Article covers sales of certain intangibles as well as transfers for security, the subsection also provides that apart from agreement the right to surplus or liability for deficiency does not accrue where the transaction between debtor and secured party was a sale and not a security transaction.</P>
<P>  4.  Subsection (4) provides that a purchaser for value from a secured party after default takes free of any rights of the debtor and of the holders of junior security interests and liens, even though the secured party has not complied with the requirements of this Part or of any judicial proceedings.  This subsection follows a similar provision in the Uniform Trust Receipts Act and in the Section of this Act on resale by a seller (Section 2-706).  Where the purchaser for value has bought at a public sale he is protected under paragraph (a) if he has no knowledge of any defects in the sale and was not guilty of collusive practices.  Where the purchaser for value has bought at a private sale he must, to receive the protection of paragraph (b), qualify in all respects as a purchaser in good faith.  Thus while the purchaser at a private sale is required to proceed in the exercise of good faith, the purchaser at public sale is protected so long as he is not actively in bad faith, and is put under no duty to inquire into the circumstances of the sale.</P>
<P>  5.  Both the Uniform Trust Receipts Act and the Uniform Conditional Sales Act required a waiting period after repossession and before sale (five days in the Trust Receipts Act, ten days in the Conditional Sales Act).  Under subsection (3) the secured party in most cases is required to give reasonable notification of disposition both to the debtor and (except for consumer goods) to other secured parties who have filed in this state or are known to him.  Except for the requirement of notification there is no statutory period during which the collateral must be held before disposition.  "Reasonable notification" is not defined in this Article; at a minimum it must be sent in such time that persons entitled to receive it will have sufficient time to take appropriate steps to protect their interests by taking part in the sale or other disposition if they so desire.</P>
<P>  6.  Section 19 of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act required that sale be made not more than thirty days after possession taken by the conditional vendor.  The Uniform Trust Receipts Act contained no comparable provision.  Here again this Article follows the Trust Receipts Act, and no period is set within which the disposition must be made, except in the case of consumer goods which under Section 9-505(1) must in certain instances be sold within ninety days after the secured party has taken possession.  The failure to prescribe a statutory period during which disposition must be made is in line with the policy adopted in this Article to encourage disposition by private sale through regular commercial channels.  It may, for example, be wise not to dispose of goods when the market has collapsed, or to sell a large inventory in parcels over a period of time instead of in bulk.  Note, however, that under subsection (3) every aspect of the sale or other disposition of the collateral must be commercially reasonable; this specifically includes method, manner, time, place and terms.  See Section 9-507(2).  Under that provision a secured party who without proceeding under Section 9-505(2) held collateral a long time without disposing of it, thus running up large storage charges against the debtor, where no reason existed for not making a prompt sale, might well be found not to have acted in a "commercially reasonable" manner.  See also Section 1-203 on the general obligation of good faith.</P>
