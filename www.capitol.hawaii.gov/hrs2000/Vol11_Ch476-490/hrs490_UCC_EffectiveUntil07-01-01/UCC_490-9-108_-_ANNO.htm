<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Many financing transactions contemplate that the collateral will include both the debtor's existing assets and also assets thereafter acquired by him in the operation of his business.  This Article generally validates such after-acquired property interests (see Section 9-204 and Comment) although they may be subordinated to later purchase money interests under Section 9-312(3) and (4).</P>
<P>  Interests in after-acquired property have never been considered as involving transfers of property for antecedent debt merely because of the after-acquired feature, nor should they be so considered.  The section makes explicit what has been true under the case law an after-acquired property interest is not, by virtue of that fact alone, security for a pre-existing claim.  This rule is of importance principally in insolvency proceedings under the federal Bankruptcy Act or state statutes which make certain transfers for antecedent debt voidable as preferences.  The determination of when a transfer is for antecedent debt is largely left by the Bankruptcy Act to state law.</P>
<P>  Two tests must be met under this section for an interest in after-acquired property to be one not taken for an antecedent debt.  First:  the secured party must, at the inception of the transaction, have given new value in some form.  Second:  the after-acquired property must come in either in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or as an acquisition which is made under a contract of purchase entered into within a reasonable time after the giving of new value and pursuant to the security agreement.  The reason for the first test needs no comment.  The second is in line with limitations which judicial construction has placed on the operation of after-acquired property clauses.  Their coverage has been in many cases restricted to subsequent ordinary course acquisitions this Article does not go so far (see Section 9-204 and Comment), but it does deny present value status to out of ordinary course acquisitions not made pursuant to the original loan agreement.  This solution gives the secured party full protection as to the collateral which he may be reasonably thought to have contracted for; it gives other creditors the possibility, under the law of preferences, of subjecting to their claims windfall or uncontemplated acquisitions shortly before bankruptcy.</P>
<P>  2.  The term "value" is defined in Section 1-201(44) and discussed in the accompanying Comment.  In this Section and in other sections of this Article the term "new value" is used but is left without statutory definition.  The several illustrations of "new value" given in the text of this Section (making an advance, incurring an obligation, releasing a perfected security interest) as well as the "purchase money security interest" definition in Section 9-107 indicate the nature of the concept.  In other situations it is left to the courts to distinguish between "new" and "old" value, between present considerations and antecedent debt.</P>
