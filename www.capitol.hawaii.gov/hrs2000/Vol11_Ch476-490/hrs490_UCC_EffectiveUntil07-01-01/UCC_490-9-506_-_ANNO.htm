<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 18, Uniform Conditional Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Modified to conform to the scheme of this Article.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  Except in the case stated in Section 9-505(1) (consumer goods) the secured party is not required to dispose of collateral within any stated period of time.  Under this Section so long as the secured party has not disposed of collateral in his possession or contracted for its disposition, and so long as his right to retain it has not become fixed under Section 9-505(2), the debtor or another secured party may redeem.  The debtor must tender fulfillment of all obligations secured, plus certain expenses:  if the agreement contains a clause accelerating the entire balance due on default in one installment, the entire balance would have to be tendered.  "Tendering fulfillment" obviously means more than a new promise to perform the existing promise; it requires payment in full of all monetary obligations then due and performance in full of all other obligations then matured.  If unmatured obligations remain, the security interest continues to secure them as if there had been no default.</P>
<P>  Under Section 9-504 the secured party may make successive sales of parts of the collateral in his possession.  The fact that he may have sold or contracted to sell part of the collateral would not affect the debtor's right under this Section to redeem what was left.  In such a case, of course, in calculating the amount required to be tendered the debtor would receive credit for net proceeds of the collateral sold.</P>
