<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  The assignee of accounts, chattel paper, contract rights or instruments holds as collateral property which is not only the most liquid asset of the debtor's business but also property which may be collected without any interruption of the business, assuming it to continue after default.  The situation is far different from that where the collateral is inventory or equipment, whose removal may bring the business to a halt. Furthermore the problems of valuation and identification, present where the collateral is tangible chattels, do not arise so sharply on the assignment of intangibles.  Considerations, similar although not identical, apply to assignments of general intangibles, which are also covered by the rule of the Section. Consequently, this Section recognizes the fact that financing by assignment of intangibles lacks many of the complexities which arise after default in other types of financing, and allows the assignee to liquidate in the regular course of business by collecting whatever may become due on the collateral, whether or not the method of collection contemplated by the security arrangement before default was direct (i.e., payment by the account debtor to the assignee, "notification" financing) or indirect (i.e., payment by the account debtor to the assignor, "non-notification" financing).  By agreement, of course, the secured party may have the right to give notice and to make collections before default.</P>

In one form of accounts receivable financing, which is found in the "factoring" arrangements which are common in the textile industry, the assignee assumes the credit risk - that is, he buys the account under an agreement which does not provide for recourse or charge-back against the assignor in the event the account proves uncollectible.  Under such an arrangement, neither the debtor nor his creditors have any legitimate concern with the disposition which the assignee makes of the accounts.  Under another form of accounts receivable financing, however, the assignee does not assume the credit risk and retains a right of full or limited recourse or charge-back for uncollectible accounts.  In such a case both debtor and creditors have a right that the assignee not dump the accounts, if the result will be to increase a possible deficiency claim or to reduce a possible surplus.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>  3.  Where an assignee has a right of charge-back or a right of recourse, subsection (2) provides that liquidation must be made with due regard to the interest of the assignor and of his other creditors - "in a commercially reasonable manner" (compare Section 9-504 and see Section 9-507(2)) - and the proceeds allocated to the expenses of realization and to the indebtedness.  If the "charge-back" provisions of the assignment arrangement provide only for "charge-back" of bad accounts against a reserve, the debtor's claim to surplus and his liability for a deficiency are limited to the amount of the reserve.</P>
<P>  4.  Financing arrangements of the type dealt with by this section are between businessmen.  The last sentence of subsection (2) therefore preserves freedom of contract, and the subsection recognizes that there may be a true sale of accounts, chattel paper, or contract rights although recourse exists.  The determination whether a particular assignment constitutes a sale or a transfer for security is left to the courts.  Note that, under Section 9-102, this Article applies both to sales and to security transfers of such intangibles.</P>
