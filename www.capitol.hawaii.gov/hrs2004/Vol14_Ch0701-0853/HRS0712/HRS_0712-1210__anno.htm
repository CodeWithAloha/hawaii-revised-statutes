</B>
<P>  Act 106, Session Laws 1981, added the definition of "community standards," to mean a statewide standard.  It also amended the definitions of "pornographic" and "pornographic to minors."  The conference committee stated in its report (Senate Conference Committee Report No. 14 and House Conference Committee Report No. 12) that the amendments were merely to conform the definitions to the holdings of the United States Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) and the Hawaii Supreme Court in State v. Manzo, 58 Haw. 440 (1978).</P>
<P>  Act 240, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by adding definitions to comport with sexual exploitation of a minor offenses created by the Act.</P>
