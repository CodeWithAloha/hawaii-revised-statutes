<P>  Act 196, Session Laws 1974, added this section "to provide class B felony sanctions against those persons who, by threat of harm directed to a correctional worker or his immediate family, intend to influence or deter the correctional worker in performing his duties."  House Standing Committee Report No. 731-74. </P>
<P>  The Committee Report further states:  "Your Committee notes that under the present law, threatening correctional personnel would be a violation of §707-715 of the Penal Code entitled 'Terroristic threatening', a misdemeanor, or §707-724 of the Penal Code entitled 'Criminal coercion', a class C felony.  Your Committee believes that the nature of the crime is such that it should be classified as a class B felony." </P>
