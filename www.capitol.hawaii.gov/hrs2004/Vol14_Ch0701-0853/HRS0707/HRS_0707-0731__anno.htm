</B>
<P>  Because sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of §707-733(1)(a) and attempted sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of §§705-500 and 707-733(1)(a) are included offenses of charged offense of attempted sexual assault in the second degree in violation of §§705-500 and 707-731(1)(a), circuit court erred in refusing, over appellant's objection, to instruct jury with respect to them. 79 H. 46, 897 P.2d 973.</P>
<P>  Evidence sufficient to establish absence of consent and thus sufficient to establish element of "compulsion".  81 H. 39, 912 P.2d 71.</P>
<P>  State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that complainant was mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless and defendant was aware that complainant was such a person.  81 H. 447 (App.), 918 P.2d 254.</P>
<P>  An imprisoned person's consent to "sexual penetration" by an employee of a state correctional facility is ineffective and thus is not a defense to a charge brought under subsection (1)(c).  86 H. 426 (App.), 949 P.2d 1047.</P>
<P>  Subsection (1)(c) not unconstitutionally vague.  86 H. 426 (App.), 949 P.2d 1047.</P>
