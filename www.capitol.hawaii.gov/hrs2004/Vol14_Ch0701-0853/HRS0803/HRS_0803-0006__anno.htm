<P>  Proper manner of making arrest.  1 H. 72; 3 U.S.D.C. Haw. 239.  Law does not make it imperative that the officer declare that he is an officer before he puts his hand on the supposed offender.  9 H. 522. </P>
<P>  After legal arrest person becomes lawful prisoner.  8 H. 185.</P>

<P>  Arrest was reasonable response to situation even though offense was simple trespass.  64 H. 130, 637 P.2d 1105. </P>

<P>  Where police had probable cause to arrest defendant without a warrant for fourth degree theft, a petty misdemeanor under §708-833, and simple trespass, a violation under §708-815, and this section authorized them to cite, rather than arrest, defendant for those offenses if defendant did not have any outstanding arrest warrants, outstanding warrant check on defendant by police not unconstitutional.  91 H. 111 (App.), 979 P.2d 1137.</P>
