<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENTARY ON §706-640</P>
</B>
<P>  This section sets forth the maximum fine authorized for any offense according to grade and class.  The maximum amount provided should be sufficient for both deterrent and correctional purposes; discretion in imposing a fine within the set maximum should be guided by the criteria set forth in §706-641.</P>
<P>  The most significant use of the fine as a means of penalizing the offender is in offenses involving pecuniary gain.  When the amount of pecuniary gain is proven, subsection (5) subordinates the stated amounts and authorizes a greater fine in an amount equal to double the pecuniary gain.</P>
<P>  The third paragraph of the commentary appearing in the main volume is reproduced to correct a printing error:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;"Subsection (6) acknowledges that other higher or lower fines may be authorized with respect to specific offenses when deemed necessary or appropriate to the situation.  Subsection (6) also preserves and recognizes higher and lower limits for offenses which are set by provisions of law not within the Penal Code."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>  Because of the questionable wisdom and constitutionality of authorizing the disposition of assessing costs against convicted defendants in criminal cases, the Code departs from prior Hawaii law and does not authorize such a sentence.  As a practical matter, costs are almost never imposed in criminal cases.  The departure is from previous statutory language rather than practice.</P>

</B>
<P>  Act 314, Session Laws 1986, increased the maximum amounts of fines to allow a sentencing court discretion to impose severe fines, especially when the offender derives great financial gain from the criminal activity.  Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.</P>
<P>  Act 181, Session Laws 1987, added language to this section to reflect the recently created statutory murder and attempted murder crimes.  These crimes are murder in the first and second degree and attempted murder in the first and second degree.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1130.</P>
<P>  Act 149, Session Laws 1997, amended this section to impose mandatory fines upon persons convicted of receiving stolen property.  With the property crime rate continuing to escalate at a dramatic rate, the legislature supported the imposition of severe penalties for those who are in receipt of stolen property, in an effort to deter the criminal activity.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1600.</P>
