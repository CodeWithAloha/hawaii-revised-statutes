</B>
<P>  Act 10, Session Laws 2004, amended this section by removing the reference to the probation services special fund's exemption under §§36-27 and 36-30, to make this section consistent with the amendments made to §§36-27 and 36-30 by L 2003, c 179.  Act 179, Session Laws 2003, amended §§36-27 and 36-30 by removing the exemption of certain special funds, among them the probation services special fund under this section, from paying the costs of central service operations of government and administrative expenses incurred by the departments responsible for the operations supported by the special funds.  However, this section was not amended and still contained language exempting the fund from these expenses.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1015-04.</P>
