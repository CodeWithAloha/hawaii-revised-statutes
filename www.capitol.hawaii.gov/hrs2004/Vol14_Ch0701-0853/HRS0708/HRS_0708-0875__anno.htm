</B>
<P>  Act 277, Session Laws 1997, added this section, which establishes the offense of trademark counterfeiting as a class C felony, and which authorizes the forfeiture and destruction or other disposition of counterfeited property.  The legislature found that trademark counterfeiting was a recurring problem in Hawaii for retail boutiques and trademark products of the University of Hawaii, and that tourists are often the target for the scams.  The legislature believed that the Act would safeguard not only consumers from the sale of counterfeit products, but would also protect the reputation and quality of trademarks and ensure that trademarks are used for their legitimate and intended purposes.
