<P>  L 2004, c 44, §§17 and 18 provide:</P>
<P>  "SECTION 17.  Section 16 [section 431M-5.5] shall be exempt from the impact assessment report by the auditor under section 23-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes.  The legislature finds that an emergency situation exists in the state that demands an immediate legislative response, and that the slight financial impact of a rise in premiums is likely to be incalculable (Auditor Report No. 88-6).</P>
<P>  SECTION 18. The treatment of drug and alcohol dependency provided under medical plans participating in QUEST and the fee for services program administered by the department of human services shall be equal to and co-extensive with QUEST and fee for services program coverage for physical disease and illnesses.  Nothing in this section shall require QUEST and the fee for services program to provide residential treatment benefits except as it may provide for physical disease and illnesses."</P>
