<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§431M-5  Nondiscrimination in deductibles, copayment plans, and other limitations on payment.</B>  (a)  Deductible or copayment plans may be applied to benefits paid to or on behalf of patients during the course of treatment as described in section 431M-4, but in any case the proportion of deductibles or copayments shall be not greater than those applied to comparable physical illnesses generally requiring a comparable level of care in each policy.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), health maintenance organizations may establish reasonable provisions for enrollee cost-sharing so long as the amount the enrollee is required to pay does not exceed the amount of copayment and deductible customarily required by insurance policies which are subject to the provisions of this chapter for this type and level of service.  Nothing in this chapter prevents health maintenance organizations from establishing durational limits which are actuarially equivalent to the benefits required by this chapter.  Health maintenance organizations may limit the receipt of covered services by enrollees to services provided by or upon referral by providers associated with the health maintenance organization.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A health insurance plan shall not impose rates, terms, or conditions including service limits and financial requirements, on serious mental illness benefits, if similar rates, terms, or conditions are not applied to services for other medical or surgical conditions.  This chapter shall not apply to individual contracts; provided further that this chapter shall not apply to QUEST medical plans under the department of human services until July 1, 2002.
