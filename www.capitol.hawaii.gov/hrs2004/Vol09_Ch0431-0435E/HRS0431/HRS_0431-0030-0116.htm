The commission shall adopt rules to establish procedures for appointing the review panel and provide for notice and hearing.  An allegation that the commission, in disapproving a product or advertisement filed with the commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with section 431:30-103.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The commission may monitor, review, and reconsider products and advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product or advertisement does not meet the relevant uniform standard.  Where appropriate, the commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in this section. [L 2004, c 104, pt of §2]</P>
