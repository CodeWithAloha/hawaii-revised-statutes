<P>&#9;(b)&#9;(1)  The insurer shall provide reasonable notice to an insured prior to termination of payment for motor vehicle storage charges and document the notice in the claim file.

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;An insurer shall make no advance charge deductions for storage and towing charges unless excessive charges have resulted from the insured's own actions.  The insurer shall itemize each advance charge deduction and maintain in its claim file documentation of the reasons and dollar amounts involved in each deduction.</P></DIR>
