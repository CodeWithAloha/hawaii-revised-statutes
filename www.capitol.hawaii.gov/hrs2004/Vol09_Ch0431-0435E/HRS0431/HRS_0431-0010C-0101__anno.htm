<P>  When a defendant is charged with a violation of this article, §805-13 is the proper procedural statute for the district court, enforcement officers, and the prosecutor's office to follow.  86 H. 331 (App.), 949 P.2d 171.</P>
<P>  As §1-1 does not establish the supremacy of the 1840 Constitution over the current state constitution, or somehow render the documents concurrent, whether chapter 431 violated the 1840 Constitution was immaterial for purposes of defendant's conviction.  90 H. 130 (App.), 976 P.2d 444.</P>
