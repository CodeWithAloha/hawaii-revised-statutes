<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§431:30-119]  Withdrawal.</B>  (a)  Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact ("withdrawing state") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute.  However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state, unless the approval is rescinded by the withdrawing state as provided in subsection (e).</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The commissioner of the withdrawing state shall immediately notify the management committee in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within ten days of its receipt thereof.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The withdrawing state shall be responsible for its share of obligations, duties, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state.  The commission's approval of products and advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the withdrawing state unless formally rescinded by the withdrawing state in the same manner as provided by the laws of the withdrawing state for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the effective date of the withdrawing state's reenactment of the compact. [L 2004, c 104, pt of §2]</P>
