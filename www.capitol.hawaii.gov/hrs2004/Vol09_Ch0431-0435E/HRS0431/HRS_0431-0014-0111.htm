<P>&#9;(b)  Every advisory organization shall file with the commissioner:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  If, after a hearing, the commissioner finds that the furnishing of such information or assistance by the advisory organization involved any act or practice which is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with this article, the commissioner may issue a written order specifying in what respects the act or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with this article, and requiring the discontinuance of the act or practice.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  No insurer which makes its own filings, nor any rating organization, shall support its filings by statistics or adopt ratemaking recommendations furnished to it by an advisory organization which has not complied with this section or with an order of the commissioner involving the statistics or recommendations issued under subsection (c).  If the commissioner finds such insurer or rating organization to be in violation of this subsection, the commissioner may issue an order requiring the discontinuance of such violation.
