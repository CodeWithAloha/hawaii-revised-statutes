<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;Reinsurance recoverables on paid losses from unauthorized insurers that are included as assets in the annual or quarterly statement; but only to the extent a liability for such unauthorized recoverables is included in the liabilities report in the trusteed surplus statement; </P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iv)&#9;Special state deposits held for the exclusive benefit of policyholders, or policyholders and creditors, of any particular state not exceeding net liabilities reported for that state;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(v)&#9;Secured accrued retrospective premiums;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(vii)&#9;If a life insurer, the net amount of uncollected and deferred premiums; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(viii)&#9;Any other non-trusteed asset that the commissioner determines secures liabilities in a substantially similar manner; and</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;Provide any additional information that the commissioner may require relating to the total business or assets, or any portion thereof, of the alien insurer.</P></DIR>
