<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§431:3-212.5  Redomestication of authorized insurers.</B>  (a)  The certificate of authority, producer appointments and licenses, rates, and other items allowed by the commissioner, which are in existence at the time an insurer authorized to transact insurance business in this State transfers its corporate domicile to this or any other state by merger, consolidation, or any other lawful method shall continue in full force and effect upon such transfer if the insurer remains qualified to transact insurance business in this State.  For purposes of this section, an insurer transferring its corporate domicile to this State remains qualified to transact insurance business in this State if it meets the organization and licensing requirements applicable to the same type of domestic insurer.  All outstanding policies of a transferring insurer shall remain in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the new name of the company or its new location unless so ordered by the commissioner.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Each transferring insurer shall file new policy forms on or before the effective date of the transfer if such forms are required to be approved by the commissioner.  The insurer may use existing policy forms with appropriate endorsements if permitted by, and under such conditions as approved by, the commissioner.  Every such transferring insurer shall notify the commissioner of the details of the proposed transfer and shall file promptly any resulting amendments to corporate documents filed or required to be filed with the commissioner.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The commissioner may apply this section to any domestication occurring in another state by an authorized United States branch of an alien insurer. [L 1991, c 181, §1; am L 2002, c 155, §8; am L 2004, c 122, §9]</P>
