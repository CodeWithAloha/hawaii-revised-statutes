<P>&#9;(b)  The measure of the tax for the year in which the taxpayer begins business is an estimate of the net income of the taxpayer for that year or for the part of that year in which it is in business.</P>
<P>&#9;The tax for the year in which the taxpayer begins business shall be at the tax rate provided in section 241<B>-</B>4.</P>
<P>&#9;The estimate shall be made on forms provided by the department and shall be subject to adjustment by the filing of an amended return as provided in subsection (e).

<P>&#9;This subsection shall not apply to any taxpayer whose tax for the year involved is measured under subsection (b) by an estimate of gross income for such year subject to adjustment after the close of the year.</P>
<P>&#9;If the first paragraph of this subsection applies but the tax of the acquiring taxpayer for the year is governed by subsection (c) and adjusted under subsection (e), then in determining the average monthly net income for that purpose there shall be included in addition to the net income of the acquiring taxpayer for the period involved in the determination of the average, the net income of the business or part thereof acquired by the taxpayer for the portion of that period in which the business was not operated by the acquiring taxpayer.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  Whenever there is a consolidation or merger of taxpayers subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, the tax shall attach to the taxpayer thus formed and the net income which shall be used for measuring the tax of the taxpayer thus formed shall include the net income of the taxpayers which were consolidated or merged.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  If a taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by this chapter terminates business operations during the calendar or fiscal year and other than in an acquisition by another company, or merger, or consolidation, the tax shall apply to the actual net income for the taxable year or part of the taxable year the taxpayer continued business operations.</P>
