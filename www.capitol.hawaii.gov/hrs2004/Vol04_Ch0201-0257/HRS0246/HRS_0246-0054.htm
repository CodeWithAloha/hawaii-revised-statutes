<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The tax assessor shall determine whether the property was wholly destroyed, or was partially destroyed or damaged, and in the latter event shall determine what percentage of the value of the whole property was destroyed or otherwise lost by reason of the disaster.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If the property was wholly destroyed the amount remitted shall be such portion of the total tax on the property for the tax year in which such destruction occurred as shall constitute the portion of the tax year remaining after such destruction.</P>
