</B>
<P>  Where plaintiffs alleged violations of Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) and made other claims based on county planning commission's denial of a special use permit sought under this section:  among other things, no Eleventh Amendment immunity for the county; RLUIPA, assuming it was constitutional, did not facially invalidate Hawaii's land use law; strict scrutiny test would apply in assessing county's past actions in further proceedings in the case.  229 F. Supp. 2d 1056.</P>
<P>  Former provision requiring that a public hearing on an application for a special permit be held within one hundred twenty days was directory not mandatory.  62 H. 666, 619 P.2d 95.</P>
<P>  Validity of attaching conditions for approval of special permit.  62 H. 666, 619 P.2d 95.</P>
<P>  Recreational theme park on agricultural land was not "unusual and reasonable use" which would qualify for special permit.  64 H. 265, 639 P.2d 1079.</P>
<P>  "Communications equipment buildings" and "utility lines" in §205-4.5(a)(7) do not encompass "telecommunications antennas" or "transmission antennas" such as a cellular telephone tower; public utility thus had to apply for a special permit under this section to place the tower in a state agricultural district.  90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.</P>
