The department may further require the deposit of moneys with it for such reimbursement.  The department shall return any amount of the deposit exceeding the amount required to reimburse the State to the party that made the deposit.  The State shall not be required to pay to the project party any interest or earnings on the deposit.</P>
<P>&#9;The department shall not enter into any project agreement with respect to any project unless the department shall first find and determine either that the project party is a responsible party, whether by reason of economic assets or experience in the type of enterprise to be undertaken through the project, or some other reason, or that the obligations of the project party under the project agreement will be unconditionally guaranteed by a person who is a responsible party, whether by reason of economic assets or experience in the type of enterprise to be undertaken through the project, or some other reason.
