<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§39A-260]  Security for special purpose revenue bonds.</B>  Special purpose revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the revenues derived by the department from payments made to the department under the project agreement, project agreements, or other supplemental agreements entered into with respect to the project or projects for the financing of which the special purpose revenue bonds were issued.  The special purpose revenue bonds shall be secured solely by such revenues and by the pledges and assignments authorized by this part.  Subject to the prior and superior rights of outstanding bonds, claims, obligations, or mechanic's and materialman's liens, all special purpose revenue bonds of the same issue shall have a prior and paramount lien on the revenue derived from the project agreement or agreements with respect to the project or projects for which the bonds were issued.  The lien shall be over and ahead of all special purpose revenue bonds of any issue payable from the revenues that may be subsequently issued and over and ahead of any claims or obligations of any nature against the revenues subsequently arising or subsequently incurred; provided that the right and privilege may be reserved by the department in the trust indenture securing an issue of special purpose revenue bonds to issue subsequently additional special purpose revenue bonds, subject to legislative authorization of the issue as provided in section 39A-257.  The department may also permit the project party or another party on its behalf to incur debt, from time to time, payable from the revenues derived from the project agreement on a parity with the first issue of the special purpose revenue bonds.  Any subsequent issue of special purpose revenue bonds and other debt issued or incurred in accordance with the provisions of the trust indenture shall be secured equally and ratably with the first issue of the special purpose revenue bond by a lien on the revenues in accordance with this part and without priority based on the date of sale, date of execution, or date of delivery.</P>
<P>&#9;Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, all or part of the property constituting the project and all interest of the project party in the project and the revenues of the project party therefrom may be subjected to the present and future lien of any mortgage of the project party securing the project party's bonds.  The rights of the department and any trustee for the holders of the special purpose revenue bonds and the holders of the special purpose revenue bonds in the project and the revenues therefrom may be made subject to the prior lien of the project party's mortgage.
