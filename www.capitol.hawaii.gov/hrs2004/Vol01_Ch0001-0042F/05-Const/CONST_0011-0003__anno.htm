<P>  Unconstitutional if applied to deny importation of out-of-state goods for no reason other than goods traveled in interstate commerce.  590 F. Supp. 778.</P>
<P>  This section requires legislative action to become operative; the nature of the required legislative action, at the least, is the adoption of standards and criteria; because this section is not "complete in itself", it requires implementing legislation.  102 H. 465, 78 P.3d 1.</P>
<P>  Until standards and criteria for the preservation of agricultural lands are adopted by the legislature, this section is legally inoperative; thus, developer's lands could be rezoned without a two-thirds majority vote of the city council; trial court correctly ruled that passage of council rezoning bill by simple majority did not violate this section.  102 H. 465, 78 P.3d 1.</P>
