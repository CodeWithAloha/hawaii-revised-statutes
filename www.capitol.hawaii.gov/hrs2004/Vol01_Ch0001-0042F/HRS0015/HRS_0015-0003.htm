When requesting an application form for an absentee ballot, the applicant shall specify the applicant's eligibility for only the presidential ballot, and the fact of applicant's ineligibility to vote at the applicant's new place of residence verified by the voter registrar or the registrar's authorized representative in the jurisdiction of the applicant's new residence.  The application must be received in sufficient time for ballots to be mailed and returned prior to any presidential election at which the applicant wishes to vote.  All required information pursuant to the rules promulgated by the chief election officer shall be completed in full. [L 1975, c 36, pt of §3; gen ch 1985]</P>
