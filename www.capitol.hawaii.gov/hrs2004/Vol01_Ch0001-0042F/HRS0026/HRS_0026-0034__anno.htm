<P>  The board of election inspectors are within the purview of this section and any vacancy occurring must be filled as prescribed by the State Constitution.  Att. Gen. Op. 67-16.</P>
<P>  Members whose terms are subject to this section hold over upon expiration of their terms of office as de facto officers; but members authorized to hold over until successors are appointed and qualified, as in §304-3, hold over as de jure officers.  Att. Gen. Op. 73-7.</P>
<P>  While the title or status of de facto officers may not be collaterally attacked, the de facto status is no defense in a quo warranto proceeding.  Att. Gen. Op. 73-7.</P>
