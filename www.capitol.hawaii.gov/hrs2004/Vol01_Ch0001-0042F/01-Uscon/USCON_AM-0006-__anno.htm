<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<B><P>Generally.</P>
</B><P>  Defendant has constitutional right to have all stages of a criminal trial conducted by a person with jurisdiction to preside.  42 F.3d 473.</P>
<P>  No violation of defendant's due process right to a fair trial by prosecution's refusal to reveal exact dates of confidential informant's observations as exact dates were not necessary in order for defendant to challenge district court's findings of probable cause.  88 H. 396, 967 P.2d 228.</P>

<B><P>Speedy trial.</P>
</B><P>  Despite government's negligent delay in bringing third superseding indictment, defendant not entitled to dismissal of the indictment on Sixth Amendment grounds because defendant had not shown prejudice attributable to the delay.  322 F.3d 1157.</P>
<P>  Right under this amendment does not arise until after formal charge or indictment is lodged; whether the delay occurring thereafter amounts to unconstitutional deprivation depends upon circumstances.  316 F. Supp. 892.</P>
<P>  Delay of thirty-six months between indictment and trial was not a violation of defendant's right to a speedy trial where delay was caused by the inability to locate defendant.  666 F. Supp. 1428.</P>
<P>  Whether preindictment delay warrants dismissal of indictment rests within the discretion of the trial court.  43 H. 203.</P>
<P>  Provision has no application to delay occurring when there is no pending  prosecution.  47 H. 361, 389 P.2d 439.</P>
<P>  Provision has no application until putative defendant becomes an accused through charge or detention.  53 H. 652, 500 P.2d 1171.</P>
<P>  Burden upon movant to show prima facie case.  54 H. 443, 509 P.2d 549.</P>
<P>  In determining whether right to speedy trial has been violated, a balancing test must be used; factors that go into such a test.  54 H. 443, 509 P.2d 549.</P>
<P>  Right arises only when a person becomes an accused, which occurs when an indictment or information is returned against a person or when the person becomes subject to restraints on the person's liberty imposed by arrest.  54 H. 443, 509 P.2d 549.</P>
<P>  No deprivation of right where delays were a result of defendant's acts or the result of benefit granted defendant.  59 H. 456, 583 P.2d 337.</P>
<P>  Juvenile facing criminal charges as an adult becomes an "accused" upon issuance of family court's order waiving jurisdiction.  61 H. 12, 594 P.2d 1069.</P>
<P>  Speedy trial clause has not been extended to the resentencing procedure, so seven-year delay between original incorrect sentence and correction did not contravene the clause.  61 H. 226, 602 P.2d 13.</P>
<P>  Factors considered in determining deprivation of speedy trial.  62 H. 518, 616 P.2d 1383.</P>
<P>  In consenting to be tried with co-defendants, defendant could not claim that co-defendant's motions were not attributable to defendant's self.  64 H. 65, 637 P.2d 407.</P>
<P>  One-year-and-three-week delay between arrest and trial is presumptively prejudicial.  64 H. 65, 637 P.2d 407.</P>
<P>  HRPP rule 48 (dismissal) has broader purpose than constitutional right to speedy trial.  73 H. 352, 833 P.2d 66.</P>
<P>  Defendant not deprived of right, where although the reason for the delay leaned marginally in defendant's favor, the weight attributed to that factor was offset by defendant's eleventh-hour assertion of defendant's right and defendant's failure to even attempt to demonstrate that defendant was actually prejudiced by the delay in the commencement of trial.  76 H. 415, 879 P.2d 520.</P>
<P>  Defendants not deprived of constitutional right to speedy trial where although the reason for the delay factor weighed in favor of the defendants, it was outweighed by the facts that defendants failed to assert their right and failed to demonstrate that they were actually prejudiced by the delay in bringing them to trial.  78 H. 54, 890 P.2d 291.</P>
<P>  Where defendant was substantially responsible for pretrial delay and failed to assert right to speedy trial, allowing defendant's  case to proceed to trial after eleven-month delay was not error.  92 H. 192, 990 P.2d 90.</P>
<P>  Presumption of prejudice arising from 9-month delay between indictment and trial was rebutted by the record.  1 H. App. 31, 613 P.2d 919.</P>
<P>  To determine whether right to speedy trial has been denied, a balancing test is used; factors that go into such test.  1 H. App. 121, 615 P.2d 109.</P>
<P>  Among factors to be considered is prejudice to defendant caused by oppressive pretrial incarceration, ignominy occasioned by pending criminal charges, and difficulty of preparing for trial.  9 H. App. 232, 832 P.2d 284.</P>
<P>  Right not violated where delay was caused by defendant's own absence from Hawaii and consequent unavailability for trial, and defendant failed to produce evidence that defendant suffered any prejudice.  83 H. 496 (App.), 927 P.2d 1379.</P>
<P>  Right not violated where, although the prejudice prong of the Barker analysis weighed in favor of defendant, this prejudice was outweighed by the delay attributable to defendant and defendant's failure to demand a speedy trial; that the unavailability of victim as a witness caused the "possibility of prejudice" to defendant's defense did not support defendant's position that defendant's speedy trial right was violated.  103 H. 490 (App.), 83 P.3d 753.</P>

<B><P>Public trial.</P>
</B><P>  Defendant waived right to testify.  883 F.2d 750.</P>
<P>  District court's exclusion of spectators during brief mid-trial questioning of jurors to determine if they were concerned for their safety was so trivial as to not implicate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.  316 F.3d 955.</P>
<P>  Defendant who intentionally failed to appear at trial waived Sixth Amendment rights to appear.  666 F. Supp. 1432.</P>
<P>  Courts are open to the public subject to the supervision of the presiding judge and there was no error in court's refusal to clear courtroom of police recruits.  47 H. 185, 389 P.2d 146.</P>
<P>  Defendant's right to be present at all stages of trial; voluntary absence.  58 H. 425, 570 P.2d 848.</P>
<P>  Court's authority to close judicial proceedings.  59 H. 224, 580 P.2d 49.</P>
<P>  Defendant entitled as of right to public trial but not to private trial.  59 H. 224, 580 P.2d 49.</P>
<P>  Manner in which defendant's family was excluded from courtroom violated defendant's right to a public trial.  91 H. 181, 981 P.2d 1127.</P>
<P>  The right to a public trial is not implicated by the exclusion of a potential witness pursuant to the witness exclusionary rule; both the witness exclusionary rule and the right to a public trial ensure the appearance of fairness at trial; thus, defendant's right not violated by exclusion of defendant's father from the courtroom as a potential prosecution rebuttal  witness.  97 H. 206, 35 P.3d 233.</P>

<B><P>Jury trials.</P>
</B><P>  Error to play tape recording without defendant's waiver of right to be present, but error harmless.  781 F.2d 740.</P>
<P>  Jury trials not required in "petty" offenses.  51 H. 612, 466 P.2d 422.</P>
<P>  Announcement of waiver by counsel in open court in the presence of accused is effective waiver.  53 H. 551, 497 P.2d 1360.</P>
<P>  Demand in open court for jury-waived trial by accused's counsel in accused's presence constitutes waiver of right to jury trial.  54 H. 28, 501 P.2d 977.</P>
<P>  Court's refusal to allow voir dire inquiries into specific possible prejudices of prospective jurors upheld as within discretion.  57 H. 492, 559 P.2d 728.</P>
<P>  Deferred acceptance of guilty plea program does not impose an impermissible burden on exercise of right to trial by jury.  58 H. 304, 568 P.2d 1194.</P>
<P>  Criteria to determine whether offense is petty or serious; person charged with petty misdemeanor carrying maximum penalty of thirty days confinement, a fine, or both, is not entitled to jury trial.  64 H. 374, 641 P.2d 978.</P>
<P>  Only if proceeding is criminal is right to jury dependent on magnitude of penalty imposed.  66 H. 461, 667 P.2d 783.</P>
<P>  Driving while intoxicated is serious offense.  68 H. 38, 704 P.2d 883.</P>
<P>  Waiver of right to jury trial cannot be presumed by silent record.  73 H. 217, 830 P.2d 512.</P>
<P>  Because the record was silent as to any colloquy between court and defendant, counsel's waiver of client's right was invalid, violating defendant's right to trial by jury under Sixth Amendment and article I, §14 of Hawai'i constitution. 75 H. 118, 857 P.2d 576.</P>
<P>  No right to a jury trial for a first-offense DUI under §291-4, as amended by Act 128, L 1993.  76 H. 360, 878 P.2d 699.</P>
<P>  Where no term of imprisonment was authorized under §266-25 for violation of administrative rule regulating boat moorings, violation a presumptively petty offense for which right to jury trial did not attach; consideration of other relevant factors failed to overcome presumption.  84 H. 65, 929 P.2d 78.</P>
<P>  Under totality of facts and circumstances, defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived right to jury trial; defendant was aware of right, articulated to trial court the difference between a jury trial and judge trial, defendant's counsel stated counsel had explained difference to defendant, and defendant affirmatively indicated to trial court that waiver was voluntary and a result of defendant's own reflection.  93 H. 63, 996 P.2d 268.</P>
<P>  There is no constitutional right to a jury trial for a first-time driving under the influence of drugs offense under §291-7 (1993) as the offense is a "petty" and not "serious" offense.  97 H. 259, 36 P.3d 803.</P>
<P>  Where record indicated that trial court conducted a colloquy with defendant regarding defendant's right to a trial by jury and that defendant orally waived this right, defendant subsequently failed to overcome burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant's waiver of right to jury trial was involuntary.  99 H. 312, 55 P.3d 276.</P>
<P>  No constitutional right to trial without a jury.  2 H. App. 506, 635 P.2d 244.</P>
<P>  Only way in which remittitur can be granted is as alternative to new trial since otherwise right to trial by jury would be taken away by the court.  2 H. App. 506, 635 P.2d 244.</P>
<P>  Defendant must personally give oral or written waiver of right to jury trial; waiver by defense counsel not valid in absence of any colloquy between court and defendant.  80 H. 372 (App.), 910 P.2d 143.</P>
<P>  Right not erroneously denied where plaintiff missed ten-day jury demand deadline under DCRCP rule 38(b) without adequate excuse.  83 H. 50 (App.), 924 P.2d 544.</P>
<P>  Where trial judge failed to engage in a colloquy with defendant to ensure that the waiver of jury trial was intelligent, knowing and voluntary, and defendant's counsel did not represent in open court that defendant was aware of defendant's right to a jury trial, under the totality of circumstances, trial court failed to obtain a valid waiver of defendant's right to a jury trial.  98 H. 77 (App.), 42 P.3d 654.</P>

<B><P>Confrontation of witnesses.</P>
</B><P>  Not violated by court's refusal to admit prosecution witness' shoplifting conviction.  789 F.2d 1425.</P>
<P>  When substantial cross-examination has taken place, the courts are less inclined to find a violation of the right to confrontation.  819 F.2d 227.</P>
<P>  Where trial court asked defense counsel to designate one attorney to conduct "main" cross-examination into basic issues, and expressly allowed all defense attorneys to cross-examine as to issues particular to their own clients, appellants failed to show how court's requirement limited any relevant testimony or caused them prejudice.  127 F.3d 791.</P>
<P>  Where defendant argued that statute (18 U.S.C. §3509) setting forth procedure by which an alleged child victim can testify outside of physical presence of defendant via two-way closed circuit television violated the confrontation clause, statute (1) not unconstitutional; and (2) does not require that television monitor in witness room be located directly in child's field of vision while child testifies.  328 F.3d 493.</P>
<P>  Waiver, when effective.  51 H. 99, 451 P.2d 806.</P>
<P>  Includes the right of cross-examination.  51 H. 125, 453 P.2d 221.</P>

<P>  Admission of oral confession of a defendant implicating a co-defendant violates confrontation rights of the co-defendant.  58 H. 299, 568 P.2d 504.</P>
<P>  Not violated by evidence admissible under exception to hearsay rule, provided statement is found to be reliable.  62 H. 518, 616 P.2d 1383.</P>
<P>  Defendant's right of cross-examination may not be unduly restricted but it has never been held to be absolutely without restriction.  62 H. 572, 617 P.2d 1214.</P>
<P>  Admission of stipulation of testimony of State's witness was not a denial of the right of confrontation.  62 H. 646, 618 P.2d 1142.</P>
<P>  Waiver of right by defendant's counsel.  63 H. 186, 623 P.2d 881.</P>
<P>  Entry of stipulated testimony into evidence without determining knowing and intelligent waiver.  64 H. 187, 637 P.2d 778.</P>
<P>  Unavailability of witness; good faith effort to secure appearance.  65 H. 286, 651 P.2d 470.</P>
<P>  Defendant claiming confrontation rights violated had no standing to challenge admission of co-defendant's illegally obtained confession.  68 H. 569, 722 P.2d 1036.</P>
<P>  Redacted statement of nontestifying co-defendant did not violate confrontation clause.  70 H. 219, 768 P.2d 230.</P>
<P>  No violation where the State made a good faith effort to locate witness.  70 H. 343, 771 P.2d 509.</P>
<P>  Criminal defendant's right to be present at all stages of trial cannot be waived by counsel.  73 H. 97, 828 P.2d 280.</P>
<P>  Error for trial court to refuse to permit a defense witness to testify as penalty for violating witness exclusion rule.  73 H. 331, 832 P.2d 269.</P>
<P>  Right not violated by defendant's absence from conference settling jury instructions as conference does not involve jury's presence or witness testimony.  74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374.</P>
<P>  Admission of co-defendant's testimony concerning incriminatory out-of-court statements made against defendant did not violate defendant's rights to confront defendant's accuser under the U.S. or Hawai'i Constitutions.   76 H. 148, 871 P.2d 782.</P>
<P>  Circuit court's limitation of appellant's cross-examination of witness did not violate appellant's right to confront witnesses against appellant where appellant adequately raised issue of witness' possible bias.  78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80.</P>
<P>  Prior to introduction of videotaped interview, cross-examination of complainant sex assault victim regarding complainant's conversation with police officer satisfied defendant's right of confrontation.  80 H. 107, 905 P.2d 613.</P>
<P>  Not violated by admission of declarant's former testimony under HRE rule 804(b)(1) where prosecution established declarant's unavailability, that it had made good faith efforts to secure declarant's presence, and reliability of statement was shown.  82 H. 202, 921 P.2d 122.</P>
<P>  Abuse of discretion where trial court excluded evidence of complainant's prior conviction, by prohibiting cross-examination of complainant, from which jury could have inferred that complainant had a motive to bring false charges against defendant and give false testimony at trial.  83 H. 109, 924 P.2d 1215.</P>
<P>  Right violated as prosecution witness not "unavailable" under HRE rule 804(a)(5); prosecution's good faith efforts require a search equally as vigorous as that which it would undertake to find a critical witness if it had no prior testimony to rely upon in the event of unavailability.  83 H. 267, 925 P.2d 1091.</P>
<P>  Right not violated where trial court allowed defense adequate opportunity to raise issue of witness' possible bias while imposing modest restriction on defense's cross-examination of witness to avoid risk of prejudicing jury.  83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258.</P>
<P>  Admission into evidence of witness' grand jury testimony under HRE rule 802.1(4), past recollection recorded hearsay exception, did not violate defendant's right where witness' testimony was supported by numerous guarantees of trustworthiness and defendant was able to cross-examine witness on witness' subsequent failure to remember alleged incident.  92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959.</P>
<P>  Admission into evidence of witness' handwritten statement on the bottom of an identification form, under HRE rule 802.1(4), past recollection recorded hearsay exception, did not violate defendant's right where witness' statement was supported by numerous guarantees of trustworthiness.  92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959.</P>
<P>  Where prior inconsistent statements were properly admitted under HRE rule 802.1(1)(C) and witnesses were cross-examined with respect to their statements, substantive use of these statements did not violate defendant's confrontation rights.  92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959.</P>
<P>  Where jury had sufficient information to gauge adequately witness' credibility and to appraise witness' motivation to fabricate testimony against defendant, trial court did not abuse discretion in limiting scope of defendant's cross-examination of witness.  92 H. 192, 990 P.2d 90.</P>
<P>  Right not violated by trial court's imposition of certain restrictions on scope of defense counsel's cross-examination  where (1) there was no reasonable possibility that the cross-examination would have changed the outcome of defendant's trial; (2) witness' second forgery conviction on recross examination was beyond the scope of redirect examination; and (3) defense counsel's inquiring into the location of a map given to witness by defendant was not relevant.  99 H. 390, 56 P.3d 692.</P>
<P>  When a statutory privilege interferes with a defendant's constitutional right to cross-examine, then, upon a sufficient showing by the defendant, the witness' statutory privilege must, in the interest of the truth-seeking process, bow to the defendant's constitutional rights.  101 H. 172, 65 P.3d 119.</P>
<P>  As there is no exception under HRE rule 804(b)(8) for pending or anticipated litigation, such that statements by victim-wife would have been admissible even if a divorce proceeding had actually been underway, trial court did not abuse discretion in determining hearsay statements were trustworthy; however, trial court abused discretion in admitting statements in violation of defendant's constitutional right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.  103 H. 89, 79 P.3d 1263.</P>
<P>  Face to face confrontation is preferred; prosecution failed to show unavailability of the witness.  7 H. App. 80, 742 P.2d 986.</P>
<P>  Not violated in DUI case by admission into evidence of log showing breath-testing instrument had been tested for accuracy.  9 H. App. 130, 828 P.2d 813.</P>
<P>  Admission into evidence of redacted confessions of defendants-spouses violated defendants-spouses' confrontational rights.  10 H. App. 43, 861 P.2d 24.</P>
<P>  Trial court erred in limiting questioning regarding complainant's financial situation and relationship with fiance; error not harmless.  79 H. 255 (App.), 900 P.2d 1322.</P>
<P>  Defendant entitled to elicit evidence of complainant's past sexual behavior, not to attack complainant's character, but to determine whether complainant was mentally defective and whether defendant knew that complainant was mentally defective.  81 H. 447 (App.), 918 P.2d 254.</P>
<P>  Clause not violated where questions defendant wanted to ask police officer regarding officer's "motive", and "knowledge of how much cocaine a drug addict would consume" were not relevant to any issue in case.  82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d 916.</P>

<B><P>Right to counsel.</P>
</B><P>  Defendant's out-of-court statement, see notes to Amendment 5.</P>
<P>  Pretrial voice identifications are not "critical stages" of the criminal proceeding in which defendant entitled to presence of counsel.  577 F.2d 473.</P>
<P>  Defendant not prejudiced by errors of counsel.  652 F.2d 1369.</P>
<P>  No showing of knowing and intelligent waiver.  672 F.2d 720; 4 H. App. 614, 672 P.2d 1036.</P>
<P>  Government has burden of showing that defendant was represented by counsel or waived that right if representation at time of earlier conviction is raised as issue.  799 F.2d 1401.</P>
<P>  Defense counsel's performance deficient because of erroneous advice regarding effect of defendant's conviction and likely sentence if defendant pled guilty.  800 F.2d 861.</P>
<P>  Ineffective assistance of counsel.  817 F.2d 1352.</P>
<P>  Miranda warning failed to adequately inform defendant of right to counsel; adequacy of Miranda warning is a question of law.  869 F.2d 1349.</P>
<P>  Defendant convicted of wilfully failing to file income tax returns knowingly and intelligently chose to exercise right to defend self.  941 F.2d 893.</P>
<P>  Uncounseled misdemeanor convictions may not be used to enhance sentence of later conviction.  957 F.2d 714.</P>
<P>  Violation of attorney-client privilege implicates constitutional right to counsel only when government interferes with relationship between criminal defendant and attorney resulting in substantial prejudice to defendant.  961 F.2d 852.</P>
<P>  Counsel's absence from portion of post-charge lineup proceeding violated defendant's right to counsel; government has affirmative duty to ensure counsel's presence at entire proceeding.  998 F.2d 1460.</P>
<P>  Defense counsel's failure to object to conduct of voir dire and to lack of certain jury instructions, and failure to place more emphasis on certain evidence did not fall below level of professional competence.  1 F.3d 855.</P>
<P>  Where defendant remains silent in face of defendant's attorney's decision not to call defendant as a witness, defendant has waived right to testify.  3 F.3d 1239.</P>
<P>  Right not violated by §291-4.5 mandatory imposition of prison sentence for driving motor vehicle with revoked license.  26 F.3d 920.</P>

<P>  Corporation may use writ of coram nobis to raise ineffective assistance claim.  65 F.3d 1531.</P>
<P>  No violation of right to conflict-free counsel where defendant who raised no objection at trial failed to demonstrate that an actual conflict adversely affected defendant's lawyer's performance.  65 F.3d 1531.</P>
<P>  Appellants' right to conflict-free representation not impaired by trial court's order, where court asked defense counsel to designate one attorney to conduct "main" cross-examination into basic issues.  127 F.3d 791.</P>
<B><P>  </B>Sixth Amendment guarantee of competent counsel applies to process of cooperation with government because this is a critical stage of the proceeding for those charged with federal crimes.  District court's decision not to grant an evidentiary hearing was an abuse of discretion; defendant's factual allegations, taken as true, stated a claim for relief based on defendant's attorney's failure to be a meaningful advocate during defendant's attempted cooperation, and the effect this failure likely had on the government's decision not to make a substantial assistance motion.  326 F.3d 1111.</P>
<B><P>  </B>Where defendant alleged that defendant's attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise defendant to plead guilty immediately after defendant's arrest, the attorney's conduct did not constitute ineffective assistance.  326 F.3d 1111.</P>
<P>  Standard for habeas corpus due to lack of effective counsel: whether, with reasonably competent counsel, it is more likely than not that jury would have acquitted or convicted of a lesser offense.  488 F. Supp. 1384.</P>

<P>  Government's request that court require defendant to waive Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel on issue of inadvertent disclosure of defendant's supplemental ex parte application for funds for mitigation investigation or compel defendant to seek new counsel was not justified, where, inter alia, any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on inadvertent service of application would be purely retrospective, and although defendant may choose to waive any claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, if any, that defendant might have, court could not compel defendant to waive defendant's claim.  58 F. Supp. 2d 1153.</P>
<P>   Where petitioner alleged, among other things, that petitioner's attorney was ineffective by failing to fully investigate mitigating defense of extreme mental or emotional distress until the eve of trial, subsequently failing to seek continuance of trial to investigate the defense, (1) presumption of prejudice was inappropriate, and (2) petitioner's argument that attorney's deficient performance prejudiced petitioner's trial, rejected.  128 F.

<P>  When Hawaii was a territory, 6th Amendment applied directly, and indigent defendant had constitutional right to court-appointed counsel when entering pleas at arraignment, unless defendant waived defendant's right.  52 H. 420, 477 P.2d 630.</P>

<P>  Defendant has burden to establish ineffective assistance of counsel and meet two-part test; under Hawaii Constitution, defendant afforded greater protection of right to effective assistance of counsel than under U.S. Constitution.  74 H. 54, 837 P.2d 1298.</P>
<P>  No denial of effective assistance of counsel where counsel waived defendant's presence at conference settling jury instructions, withdrew insanity defense, and failed to object to examiner's testimony.  74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374.</P>
<P>  Where petitioner's convictions on counts I (attempted first degree murder), II (second degree murder), and III (attempted second degree murder) violated §701-109(1)(c)'s clear prohibition against inconsistent factual findings, the failure to raise this issue, both at trial and on appeal, resulted in withdrawal of not only a potentially meritorious defense, but a defense that would have altered the outcome.  74 H. 442, 848 P.2d 966.</P>
<P>  Post-conviction ineffective assistance of counsel HRPP rule 40 petition not prejudiced where defendant alleges facts that, if proven, would entitle defendant to relief and claim is not patently frivolous and without trace of support in the record.  75 H. 419, 864 P.2d 583.</P>
<P>  Trial counsel's alleged errors did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where defendant argued, inter alia, that trial counsel should have obtained expert analysis of white powder defendant provided to undercover police officer to determine how much "pure" cocaine it contained; rejection of defendant's claim that trial counsel's failure to interview and subpoena defendant's girlfriend amounted to ineffective assistance was without prejudice to a subsequent HRPP rule 40 petition.  77 H. 72, 881 P.2d 1218.</P>
<P>  A proceeding to review revocation of a driver's license under §286-259 is a civil administrative proceeding, not a criminal proceeding for DUI; thus, accused's right to assistance of counsel inapplicable to administrative driver's license revocation hearing.  80 H. 197, 908 P.2d 545.</P>
<P>  Knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of right to counsel where, inter alia, defendant persistently refused legal assistance despite court's repeated invitation and amply demonstrated capacity to proceed pro se.  81 H. 198, 915 P.2d 672.</P>

<P>  Judicial determination of probable cause proceeding is not a "critical stage" in criminal proceedings such that Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches automatically.  83 H. 443, 927 P.2d 844.</P>
<P>  Where attorney-client privilege was not applicable to communications because they were not "confidential" but "voluntarily disclosed" in known presence of third party who was neither codefendant nor representative of the client or of the lawyer and in a place accessible to the general public, right to effective assistance not violated.  84 H. 229, 933 P.2d 66.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance by counsel's failure to obtain witnesses' testimony on Japanese organized crime where counsel could not have known trial court would refuse to qualify one as expert, other witness fell ill, and testimony would not have been enough to support duress defense.  85 H. 462, 946 P.2d 32.</P>
<P>  Where defendant could have challenged the validity of the search warrant if given a range of dates of the observations by prosecution's confidential informant and defendant's attorney could file the appropriate pre-trial motions and prepare for trial without the exact dates, right to effective assistance of counsel not violated by defendant not knowing the exact dates of the observations.  88 H. 396, 967 P.2d 228.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance where counsel was able to negotiate a plea agreement of essentially a single life term with possibility of parole from a possible sentence of 610 years.  91 H. 20, 979 P.2d 1046.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance where counsel's representation, including disclosing defendant's prior criminal history, did not result in the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense; overwhelming nature of evidence against defendant and failure of self-defense claim warranted conviction.  91 H. 261, 982 P.2d 890.</P>
<P>  Right to assistance of counsel and to present a defense not violated by trial court's refusal to allow defendant to present oral argument on motion for judgment of acquittal; no constitutional right to argue a motion for judgment of acquittal.  91 H. 288, 983 P.2d 189.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance where record did not support defendant's claim that defendant's attorney failed to follow through on mental examination report, failed to pursue extreme mental or emotional disturbance defense, and should have called in a mental health professional at suppression hearing.  92 H. 19, 986 P.2d 306.</P>
<P>  An attorney "employed and paid by the county" for the benefit of a police officer, to defend the officer in a criminal case pursuant to §52D-8 and in related civil cases, in which the county has asserted claims adverse to the officer, is not per se, by virtue of such employment and payment, deemed ineffective counsel.  95 H. 9, 18 P.3d 871.</P>
<P>  Defendant was entitled to a hearing on question of whether counsel who filed motion to withdraw guilty plea should have been substituted as counsel of record before trial court summarily denied defendant's motion on the ground that a withdrawal and substitution of counsel had not been filed under rule 57, Hawaii rules of penal procedure.  95 H. 177, 19 P.3d 1289.</P>
<P>  Ineffective assistance where defense counsel failed to object to the prosecution's premature elicitation of testimony regarding defendant's prior conviction during its redirect examination of officer before defendant had "introduced testimony for the purpose of establishing defendant's credibility as a witness," as required by HRE rule 609(a).  96 H. 83, 26 P.3d 572.</P>
<P>  Where consolidation of attempted first degree murder cases with murder case was not improper, the charge of first degree robbery did not fail to state an offense, and the trial court's limiting instructions regarding "other bad acts" evidence was not inadequate or untimely, no ineffective assistance of counsel.  99 H. 390, 56 P.3d 692.</P>
<P>  Ineffective assistance of counsel as defense counsel's errors and omissions resulted in the possible impairment of a potentially meritorious defense, defense counsel failed to object to prosecution's rebuttal argument commenting on defendant's failure to testify and counsel intentionally elicited detective's opinion that defendant had murdered defendant's wife.  102 H. 504, 78 P.3d 317.</P>
<P>  Appellant has burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel; burden, how met.  1 H. App. 255, 617 P.2d 1235; 1 H. App. 268, 618 P.2d 315.</P>
<P>  Counsel's failure to object to prosecutor's questions or to move for mistrial or to strike as constituting ineffective assistance of counsel.  1 H. App. 536, 621 P.2d 986.</P>
<P>  No per se right on the part of an indigent defendant to change counsel in middle of trial.  2 H. App. 462, 634 P.2d 421.</P>

<P>  Not violated where imprisonment authorized but not imposed.  3 H. App. 673, 657 P.2d 1062.</P>
<P>  Right to effective assistance of counsel was violated by defense counsel's prior and concurrent representation of prosecution witnesses in other matters.  4 H. App. 327, 666 P.2d 612.</P>

<P>  No right to counsel at post-arrest photographic display.  5 H. App. 127, 681 P.2d 573.</P>
<P>  Standard for effective assistance of appellate counsel; right not violated.  6 H. App. 331, 720 P.2d 1015.</P>
<P>  No right to hybrid representation.  8 H. App. 330, 802 P.2d 482.</P>
<P>  Whether person arrested on basis of indictment and advised of and waived right to counsel under Miranda v. Arizona but not advised of right under Sixth Amendment and article I, §14 of Hawaii constitution, has also knowingly and intelligently waived right under the two provisions, discussed.  9 H. App. 447, 845 P.2d 1194.</P>
<P>  The court's assumption of defense counsel's role by persuading defendant to relinquish defendant's right to testify was an interference with the attorney-client relationship protected by Sixth Amendment and article I, §14 of Hawai'i constitution; the intervention by the court constituted plain error; the error was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>
<P>  Absent valid waiver of right, use of prior uncounseled felony convictions to enhance prison sentence violated defendant's right to counsel.  81 H. 421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel's failure to request trial continuance when police officer was unavailable to testify at trial did not result in prejudice to defendant.  82 H. 394 (App.), 922 P.2d 1007.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance where, inter alia, defendant's counsel adequately prepared for trial, did not fail to offer motion to sever trials, and no evidence that fact that defendant's counsel was not lead counsel was prejudicial to defendant's entrapment defense.  82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d 916.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance where there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant as accomplice to second degree murder such that motion for judgment of acquittal would not have succeeded.  84 H. 112 (App.), 929 P.2d 1362.</P>
<P>  Where right attached at the initiation of adversarial judicial criminal proceedings, and not at the point of the DUI arrest, police did not have to give Miranda-like warnings about right to counsel at the point of the DUI arrest.  94 H. 17 (App.), 7 P.3d 193.</P>
<P>  Right not violated by trial court's denial of defendant's motion to withdraw and substitute counsel as there was no good cause to warrant substitution where, despite being advised of its inadmissible nature, defendant insisted attorney proffer character evidence and character witnesses at trial, there was no "complete breakdown of trust and confidence" between attorney and defendant, and defendant elected to continue with attorney, without further protest, and did not aver that defendant wanted to go to trial pro se.  101 H. 112 (App.), 63 P.3d 420.</P>
<P>  Where defendant had not been charged with any crime when defendant gave defendant's statement, defendant's right not violated.  101 H. 344 (App.), 68 P.3d 618.</P>

<P>  Excusal of college students from venire did not violate right to jury fairly representing cross-section of community since college students did not qualify as cognizable group.  965 F.2d 781.</P>
<P>  Though prosecutor's remarks were of questionable relevance and conveyed repugnant images, reversal justified only where alleged prosecutorial misconduct materially affects verdict or deprives defendant of fair trial.  1 F.3d 1523.</P>
<P>  Habeas corpus granted due to jury misconduct.  677 F. Supp. 1061.</P>
<P>  Defendant's motion for new trial denied where defendant argued, inter alia, that new trial was necessary because juror failed to honestly answer a material question during voir dire.  101 F. Supp. 2d 1304.</P>
<P>  Scope of voir dire of prospective jurors in case of extensive pretrial publicity.  55 H. 640, 526 P.2d 94.</P>
<P>  Effect of news accounts prejudicial to defendant; protective measures required of trial court.  58 H. 356, 569 P.2d 891.</P>
<P>  Trial court's supplemental instruction to deadlocked jury that it must unanimously decide that it was unable to reach verdict was prejudicial.  72 H. 327, 817 P.2d 1054.</P>
<P>  Trial court must insure that defendant's right to fair trial is not compromised and at the least prevent or reduce prejudicial pretrial publicity; order imposing restrictions on extrajudicial statements of trial participants was impermissible.  73 H. 499, 835 P.2d 637.</P>
<P>  Circuit court did not commit an abuse of discretion in granting defendant's motion for new trial; circuit court's conclusions of law that possible juror misconduct at voir dire and juror misconduct during deliberations deprived defendant of a trial by twelve fair and impartial jurors not clearly erroneous.  76 H. 172, 873 P.2d 51.</P>
<P>  Newscast concerning appellants and their alleged involvement in a burglary other than those charged and prospective juror's account of the newscast and the effect it had on prospective juror that was given in presence of jury panel, discussed as "outside influences".  78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80.</P>
<P>  Not violated by empaneling of anonymous jury where there was strong reason to believe jury needed protection and trial court took reasonable steps to minimize any prejudicial effect on defendant and ensure that defendant's fundamental rights were protected.  83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Purpose of §612-18(c) is to uphold a criminal defendant's constitutional guarantees of a presumption of innocence and an impartial jury.  83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Defendant's right not violated by having husband and wife serve on same jury; both expressly stated during voir dire that they would each make their own decisions and would not automatically go along with the other person.  88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227.</P>
<P>  References to race that do not have an objectively legitimate purpose constitute a particularly egregious form of prosecutorial misconduct.  91 H. 405, 984 P.2d 1231.</P>
<P>  Where there was a reasonable possibility that prosecutor's comment during closing argument might have contributed to defendant's conviction, prosecutor's comment constituted prosecutorial misconduct that denied defendant right to a fair trial.  91 H. 405, 984 P.2d 1231.</P>
<P>  Given that any improper remarks in opening statement, closing and rebuttal arguments by prosecutor were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and their cumulative effect was similarly harmless and did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, prosecutor's misconduct did not warrant reversal of any of defendant's convictions and did not implicate the double jeopardy clauses of either the U.S. or Hawaii Constitutions.  95 H. 465, 24 P.3d 661.</P>
<P>  Although prosecutor's remark that the reasonable doubt standard "was never meant to provide a shield for a guilty man" had the potential to invite the jury to misapply and erode the standard, and was thus improper, where the trial court immediately corrected the prosecutor and issued a curative instruction, and verdicts suggested that the jury was not unduly swayed by the isolated remark in the two week trial and gave proper consideration to all relevant circumstances, improper comment not reversible error.  98 H. 1, 41 P.3d 157.</P>
<P>  Defendant's right not violated where defendant did not assert or show that a "distinctive group" was underrepresented in the pool of potential jurors initially selected in the case.  98 H. 1, 41 P.3d 157.</P>
<P>  Where defendant failed to satisfy defendant's burden of establishing a prima facie showing that the possibility of juror misconduct could have substantially prejudiced defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion for a new trial.  103 H. 285, 81 P.3d 1200.</P>
<P>  Failure to inquire into circumstances of statement overheard by juror, and reliance on juror's own determination of ability to remain impartial while unaware of influences is reversible error.  2 H. App. 643, 639 P.2d 413.</P>
<P>  Not violated by bailiff's statement to jury foreperson that jurors should all agree with verdict if polled.  6 H. App. 320, 721 P.2d 718.</P>
<P>  Where trial court found statements of jurors on voir dire credible, statements were sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that defendant was not denied an impartial jury.  85 H. 49 (App.), 936 P.2d 1297.</P>
<P>  Where State failed to rebut presumption of prejudice to defendant resulting from juror's improper investigation of details concerning defendant's welfare status, court properly granted motion for new trial.  89 H. 215 (App.), 971 P.2d 304.</P>
<P>  Plain error where trial court's answer to jury communication was prejudicially insufficient, misleading and affected defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous verdict as jury may have wrongly believed based on court's answer that if they failed to reach unanimous agreement as to the affirmative defense of entrapment, the defense was not applicable and a guilty verdict was required.  90 H. 489 (App.), 979 P.2d 85.</P>
<P>  Where prosecutor referred to defendants' race in opening statement, there was no curative instruction given to address the inflammatory comment, trial court overruled defense counsel's timely objection, and the case against defendants, which hinged on the credibility of complainant, was not so overwhelming as to outweigh the inflammatory comment, prosecutor's references to race might have contributed to the convictions of defendants; thus, convictions set aside.  98 H. 358 (App.), 48 P.3d 605.</P>

<B><P>Compulsory process.</P>
</B><P>  District court erred in excluding defense expert witness as sanction for asserted violation of discovery rule where no discovery violation occurred.  937 F.2d 1422.</P>
<P>  A sentencing increase based on defendant's false testimony does not unconstitutionally burden defendant's right to testify.  1 F.3d 1523; 35 F.3d 1275.</P>
<P>  Where defendant contended that pursuant to constitutional right to testify, district court was required to permit defendant to explain to jury that defendant behaved in manner that defendant did because defendant was acting under duress, whether or not defendant had demonstrated prima facie evidence of duress, since proposed testimony pertained to a defense that was not relevant as a matter of law, the district court did not err in excluding the evidence during the trial.  102 F.3d 994.</P>
<P>  Defendant only afforded right to compel attendance and testimony of witnesses who can give relevant and beneficial testimony for defense.  64 H. 217, 638 P.2d 324; 67 H. 59, 677 P.2d 465.</P>
<P>  A trial court must pass on a defendant's attempted withdrawal of the prior waiver of his or her right to testify, tendered before the commencement of closing arguments, pursuant to the "liberal approach", whereas such an attempted withdrawal tendered thereafter is subject to the "manifest injustice" standard.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where defendant did not meet burden of establishing plausible and legitimate reasons for withdrawal of defendant's prior waiver of defendant's right to testify, defendant failed to present "fair and just reasons" for defendant's request to exercise defendant's right to testify in defendant's own behalf; thus trial court did not abuse discretion by ruling that it would not reopen case.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where trial court's denial of defendant's post-verdict motion for a new trial--based on defendant's claim that defendant's attempt to withdraw defendant's waiver of right to testify in defendant's own behalf should have been allowed--was not "manifestly unjust", no abuse of discretion.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where witness appeared, exercised witness' right to remain silent, and defendant failed to offer proof beyond conjecture that witness' testimony would be helpful to defendant, defendant's right not violated.  100 H. 210, 58 P.3d 1257.</P>
<P>  Refusal of court to permit defendant at an identification suppression hearing to examine the identification witness was not violative of constitutional rights.  1 H. App. 335, 619 P.2d 1078.</P>
<P>  Constitutional right to present character evidence no greater than right under Hawaii Rules of Evidence.  5 H. App. 251, 687 P.2d 554.</P>
<P>  Defendant's constitutional and statutory right to testify in defendant's own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow defendant's attorney's advice and thus refrain from testifying, and the violation was plain error; denial of the right to testify was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>

<B><P>Appeal.</P>
</B><P>  Seven-day failure to comply with time requirements for filing criminal appeal does not preclude right to appeal.  2 H. App. 606, 638 P.2d 338.</P>

<B><P>Right to be informed.</P>
</B><P>  Indictment that charged defendant with "murder-for-hire" may not have given defendant notice that defendant must be prepared to meet a murder charge based on accomplice liability.  807 F.2d 805.</P>
<P>  Not violated where burglary indictment alleged all elements of the crime and record indicated the specific crime intended to be committed, though specific crime not alleged.  66 H. 312, 660 P.2d 39.</P>
<P>  Indictment charging general intent crime need not contain a particularized allegation of general intent.  66 H. 650, 672 P.2d 554.</P>
<P>  Not violated where indictment alleged all elements of the crime and record indicated the specific crime intended to be committed, though specific crime not alleged.  67 H. 105, 678 P.2d 1078.</P>
<P>  Not violated though indictment stated in disjunctive, where it tracked definition of crime and record indicated specific crime committed.  67 H. 119, 680 P.2d 250.</P>
<P>  Accomplice instruction improper where each defendant was charged separately and charges did not inform them of circumstances in which they acted as accomplices.  72 H. 278, 815 P.2d 428.</P>
<P>  Section 485-21 provides an essential element of offense charged, when a defendant is charged with a criminal violation of Uniform Securities Act; counts of indictment, which cited to §485-21, were insufficient, as counts did not include essential elements of offenses charged. 78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70.</P>
<P>  Although prosecution's oral charge failed to include the word "bodily" to modify "injury", the omission did not alter the nature and cause of the accusation such that a person of common understanding would fail to comprehend it; thus, the oral charge was not so obviously defective that by no reasonable construction could it be said to charge the offense for which conviction was had; because omission of the word "bodily" did not constitute an essential element of the offense, harmless error.  99 H. 312, 55 P.3d 276.</P>
<P>  Violated where minutes before trial was to commence, complaint against defendant amended from driving while license suspended to driving without a license.  81 H. 76 (App.), 912 P.2d 573.</P>
