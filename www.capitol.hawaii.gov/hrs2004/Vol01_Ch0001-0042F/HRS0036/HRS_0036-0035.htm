Expenditures from the account shall be subject to sections 37-31 and 37-33 to 37-40.  Based on the prioritization approved by the department of education as prescribed by section 302A-1505, appropriations or authorizations from the account shall be expended by the superintendent of education.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The department of education shall review the existing condition of school facilities and establish specific vision plans for each school complex based on current repair and maintenance requirements and overall repair and maintenance priorities.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Criteria used to establish current repair and maintenance requirements may include:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The remaining useful life of the school facility and its major components;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The adjusted life of the school facility and its major components after repair or maintenance; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The current and future repair and maintenance requirements of the school facility and its components based on established industry standards or product manufacturer recommendations;</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>provided that demolition of a facility or any of its components may be recommended if the cost of the repairs do not justify the adjusted life or remaining life of the facility.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Criteria used to establish overall repair and maintenance requirements may include:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Whether a school facility will continue to be used for the next twenty-five years; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Whether a repair or maintenance project is required:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;For health or safety reasons;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;To comply with legal mandates;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;To comply with current building codes; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;For preventive maintenance reasons;</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>provided that in developing criteria, consideration shall be given to school facilities that were more than twenty-five years of age on July 1, 2000.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The expenditure of funds for any project with an estimated total cost of less than $100,000 shall be exempt from section 464-4; provided that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The superintendent of education shall develop internal policies and procedures for the procurement of goods, services, and construction, consistent with the goals of public accountability and public procurement practices;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Insofar as is practical, and based on specifications developed, adequate and reasonable competition of no fewer than three proposals shall be solicited for each project, based on rules adopted by the superintendent of education;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Considering all factors, including quality, warranty, and delivery, the award shall be made to the vendor with the most advantageous proposal;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The procurement requirements shall not be artificially divided or parceled so as to avoid competitive bidding or competitive proposals; and</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Formal design for projects shall be done when there is a clear need to preserve structural integrity, health and safety, or to clearly communicate construction requirements.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;For all projects, the superintendent of education shall develop a strategy for the efficient and cost-effective use of government and private-sector workforces and consider increased flexibility through public-private partnering, design-build options, cost plus, job order contracts, performance-based contracts, request for proposals, and any other means to improve communications and accelerate repairs while preserving the quality of the repairs.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  The superintendent of education shall ensure that all repair and maintenance projects achieve maximum cost-efficiency by emphasizing functional or performance criteria, uniformity of design, and commonality of products, and by avoiding unique or custom requirements that increase costs.  The superintendent of education shall develop project specifications based on generic specifications or prescriptive specifications using standard commercial products.  Prescriptive specifications may include a qualified product list.</P>
<P>&#9;For the purposes of this subsection:</P>
<P>&#9;"Generic specification" means a technical specification that is written in a clear, unambiguous, and nonrestrictive manner establishing:</P><DIR>
