<P>  Although the Hawaii administrative rules denominate aquifer-specific reservations of water to the department of Hawaiian home lands, such a limitation for purposes of water resource management does not divest the department of its right to protect its reservation interests from interfering water uses in adjacent aquifers.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</P>
<P>  Insofar as the commission on water resource management, as the agency authorized to administer the state water code, determines the contents of the Hawaii water plan, which includes the designation of hydrologic units and sustainable yields, and the commission's "interpretation of its own rules is entitled to deference unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose", it is within the commission's authority to limit reservations of water to specific aquifers.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</P>
<P>  Where commission on water resource management failed to render the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to whether applicant had satisfied its burden as mandated by the state water code, it violated its public trust duty to protect the department of Hawaiian home lands' reservation rights under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the state water code, the state constitution, and the public trust doctrine in balancing the various competing interests in the state water resources trust.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</P>
<P>  Where commission on water resource management's findings supporting its conclusion that the proposed use of water would not interfere with department of Hawaiian home lands' reservation rights under this section failed to address whether the proposed user had adduced sufficient evidence with respect to the impact of the proposed use on the department's reservation in the adjacent aquifer system, commission erred in concluding that proposed user had met its burden under §174C-49 to obtain a water use permit.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</P>
