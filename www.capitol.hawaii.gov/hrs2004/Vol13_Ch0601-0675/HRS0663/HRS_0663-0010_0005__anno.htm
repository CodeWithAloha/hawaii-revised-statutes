<P>  Applies only to causes of action based upon acts or omissions occurring on or after June 22, 1994.  L 1994, c 213, §3.</P>

</B>
<P>  The plain language of this section's nonretroactivity clause focuses upon the specific "acts or omissions" that predicate a plaintiff's claim, and, therefore, the clause's applicability is not keyed to when the plaintiff's cause of action "accrues"; thus, trial court erred in apportioning liability between department of education (DOE) and teacher and DOE was liable to plaintiffs for the full extent of their damages.  100 H. 34, 58 P.3d 545.</P>
