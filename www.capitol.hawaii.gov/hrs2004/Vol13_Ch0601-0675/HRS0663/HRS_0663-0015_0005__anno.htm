</B>
<P>  Magistrate judge properly determined that defendant did not meet its burden of disproving good faith regarding settlement between plaintiff and other defendants.  293 F. Supp. 2d 1144.</P>
<P>  This section adequately protects a non-settling joint tortfeasor's right to procedural due process; subsections (b) and (c) afford a non-settling joint tortfeasor notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the determination whether a settlement has been given in good faith and, consequently, bars cross-claims for contribution against the settling joint tortfeasor.  102 H. 399, 77 P.3d 83.</P>
<P>  Whether a settlement was given in "good faith" for purposes of this section is a matter left to the discretion of the trial court in light of all the relevant circumstances extant at the time of settlement.  102 H. 399, 77 P.3d 83.</P>
