<P>  Where Congress has not expressly set out exclusive jurisdiction, state courts are competent to decide federal claims.  437 F. Supp. 368.</P>
<P>  Where plea of not guilty and demand for jury trial by defendant charged with a misdemeanor conferred jurisdiction on circuit court, withdrawal of such plea and of demand for jury trial does not divest circuit court of jurisdiction.  55 H. 394, 520 P.2d 427.</P>
<P>  Although misdemeanors are normally tried in district court, such offenses are within jurisdiction of circuit court.  59 H. 92, 576 P.2d 1044.</P>
