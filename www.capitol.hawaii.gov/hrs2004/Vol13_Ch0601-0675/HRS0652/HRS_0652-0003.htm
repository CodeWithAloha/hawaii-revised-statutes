The garnishee shall continue such withholding from the wages of the defendant until the action against the defendant has been finally determined and the final judgment obtained against the defendant, if any, has been fully paid with legal interest thereon.  However, no more of the wages shall be withheld from the defendant in advance of final judgment than shall be sufficient to meet the demand of the plaintiff, together with cost and legal interest.
