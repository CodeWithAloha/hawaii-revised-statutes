<P>  Privileged communications between clinical social workers and their clients, see §467E-15.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 504.1 COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<B><P>  </B>The rejected privilege rules proposed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972, see Rules of Evidence for U.S. Courts and Magistrates as promulgated by the U.S. Supreme Court, 28 App. U.S. Code Service, App. 6 (1975), contained no general physician-patient privilege but only a "psychotherapist-patient" privilege.  The case for psychotherapists and their patients was made in the original Advisory Committee's Note:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;Among physicians, the psychiatrist has a special need to maintain confidentiality.  His capacity to help his patients is completely dependent upon their willingness and ability to talk freely.  This makes it difficult if not impossible for him to function without being able to assure his patients of confidentiality and, indeed, privileged communication.  Where there may be exceptions to this general rule...there is wide agreement that confidentiality is a sine qua non for successful psychiatric treatment.  The relationship may well be likened to that of the priest-penitent or the lawyer-client.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>  Accordingly, unenacted federal Rule 504 and Uniform Rule of Evidence 503 provide the models for this rule.  Both provisions include within the definition of psychotherapist "a person licensed or certified as a psychologist under the laws of any state or nation."  The present rule limits the privilege to communications between a client and a psychologist licensed under the provision of Hawaii Rev. Stat. ch. 465 (1976).  In all other respects, the rule faithfully tracks the provisions of Rule 504 supra.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 504.1 SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<P>  The Act 134, Session Laws 2002 amendment (1) expands the definition of "psychologist" in subsection (a)(2); (2) conforms the definition of "confidential communication,"in subsection (a)(3), and the general statement of the privilege in subsection (b), to the amended definition of "psychologist"; and (3) adds subsections (d)(5) and (d)(6), containing two new exceptions to the privilege coverage of this rule.</P>
<P>  Subsection (a)(2)'s definition of "psychologist" is expanded to include persons "authorized, or reasonably believed by the client to be authorized, to engage in the diagnosis or treatment of a mental or emotional condition, including substance addiction or abuse."  Elimination of the predecessor law's jurisdictional limitation (privilege available only to persons licensed to practice psychology under Hawaii Rev. Stat. ch. 465) conforms this privilege's coverage to that of the lawyer-client and physician-patient privileges of rules 503 and 504.  And describing a qualifying psychologist's work as the "diagnosis or treatment of a mental or emotional condition" conforms this rule to rule 503 of the Uniform Rules of Evidence.  The amendments to subsections (a)(3) and (b) merely incorporate the revised "psychologist" definition of subsection (a)(2).</P>
<P>  Subsection (d)(5), entitled "Furtherance of crime or tort," bears close kinship to the counterpart crime-fraud exception to the lawyer-client privilege, rule 503(d)(1).  See the 1992 supplemental commentary to rule 503, explaining that "the paramount policy of the crime-fraud exception is to thwart the exploitation of legal advice and counseling in furtherance of unlawful goals."  A similar policy, applicable to psychologists' services, informs this exception.</P>
<P>  This new exception lifts the privilege shield from communications that reflect a client's effort to exploit a psychologist's services for a criminal or tortious purpose.  As the commentary applicable to Cal. Evid. Code §1018, which is similar, points out:  "[T]here is no desirable end to be served by encouraging such communications."</P>
<P>  Subsection (d)(6), entitled "Prevention of crime or tort," is intended to allow psychologists to make disclosures to avoid tort liability of the sort imposed by Tarasoff v. Regents, 17 Cal. 3d 425, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334 (1976) (psychotherapist's common law duty to warn foreseeable victims of a patient the therapist knows to be dangerous and likely to harm those victims).  Hawaii will likely embrace Tarasoff, see Lee v. Corregedore, 83 H. 154, 925 P.2d 324 (1996), declining to create a duty to prevent a patient's suicide but recognizing a psychotherapist's duty to "disclose the contents of a confidential communication where the risk to be prevented thereby is the danger of violent assault...."  Hawaii added a Tarasoff exception to its lawyer-client privilege in 1992, rule 503(d)(2), and the present amendment extends the same protection to psychologists.</P>

</B>
<P>  When a statutory privilege interferes with a defendant's constitutional right to cross-examine, then, upon a sufficient showing by the defendant, the witness' statutory privilege must, in the interest of the truth-seeking process, bow to the defendant's constitutional rights.  101 H. 172, 65 P.3d 119.</P>
<P>  Mother could not invoke psychologist-client privilege where counseling sessions were held pursuant to a family court order and the communications between psychologist and mother were made known to the department of human services.  8 H. App. 161, 795 P.2d 294.</P>
