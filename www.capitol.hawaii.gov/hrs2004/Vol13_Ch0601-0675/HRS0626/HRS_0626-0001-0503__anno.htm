<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 503 COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<P>  This rule is similar to Uniform Rule of Evidence 502, which adds to the U.S. Supreme Court proposal for the lawyer-client privilege, see proposed Rule 503, Rules of Evidence for U.S. Courts and Magistrates as promulgated by the U.S. Supreme Court, 28 App. U.S. Code Service, App. 6 (1975), a definition for "representative of the client," subdivision (a)(2).  Inclusion of this provision is based on the principle that a rule of privilege should be explicit.</P>
<P>  The desirability of incorporating an express definition of who may be considered a "representative of the client" is underscored by inconsistent federal court rulings on this issue in the context of corporate client-attorney relationships, compare City of Philadelphia v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 210 F. Supp. 483 (E.D. Pa. 1962), with Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Decker, 423 F.2d 487 (7th Cir. 1970).  The definition embodied in this rule is more expansive than the highly-constricted "control group" limitation imposed in City of Philadelphia, supra, in that it includes as a "representative" not only one having authority to act upon legal advice but also one authorized merely to obtain legal services on behalf of the client.  Determination of what constitutes "authority" in such a case may be made according to recognized principles of agency.</P>
<P>  Although Hawaii had no previous statutory provision for this privilege, it was recognized by the Hawaii courts, see McKeague v. Freitas, 40 H. 108 (1953); Wery v. Pacific Trust Co., 33 H. 701 (1936).  Judicial definition of the scope and limitations of the privilege in those cases is consistent with the present rule.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 503 SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<P>  The Act 191, Session Laws 1992 amendment modified subsection (d)(1) and added subsections (d)(2) and (d)(7).</P>
<P>  Subsection(d)(1):  The language of the previous rule ("sought or obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan to commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud") strongly implied a requirement that the client be shown to have entertained an unlawful intent at the time of the consultation with counsel, and some of the crime-fraud exception cases have so held, e.g., Pritchard-Keang Nam Corp. v. Jaworski, 751 F.2d 277, 281 (8th Cir. 1984).  But the crime-fraud exception obtains without regard to the lawyer's awareness -- or lack of awareness -- of the client's unlawful motivation.</P>
<P>  That being so, and keeping in mind that the paramount policy of the crime-fraud exception is to thwart the exploitation of legal advice and counseling in furtherance of unlawful goals, courts have extended the exception to cases where the client's criminal intent is formed only after legal consultation, e.g., Fidelity-Phoenix Fire Ins. Co. of New York v. Hamilton, 340 S.W.2d 218, 219 (Ky. 1960), where the client, after learning from his first lawyer that his fire damages were exempted from insurance coverage by a suspension provision in the policy, went to a second lawyer and falsely represented facts that supported a claim under the policy.  The court held that the claim was fraudulent and that the communications to the first lawyer were not privileged.  The extension of the crime-fraud exception to this sort of case is approved in Fried, Too High a Price for Truth:  The Exception to the Attorney-Client Privilege for Contemplated Crimes and Frauds, 64 N.C.L. Rev. 443, 458-59, 480-81 (1986).  It is, moreover, fully consistent with the lawyers' rule of professional responsibility, see Hawaii Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 7-102(B)(1), requiring the lawyer to rectify or to reveal client fraud committed "in the course of the representation."  Indeed, one advantage of the current amendment is to expand the crime-fraud exception to allow for revelations that Hawaii lawyers are professionally committed to making.</P>
<P>  Subsection(d)(2):  This new addition to the attorney-client privilege exceptions conforms the rule of privilege to the lawyers' professional responsibility rule, see Hawaii Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 4-101(C)(3), permitting a lawyer to reveal the client's intention "to commit a crime, and the information necessary to prevent the crime."  DR 4-101(C)(3) is permissive, but tort law, cf. Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California, 17 Cal. 3d 425, 551 P.2d 334 (1976), may compel such a revelation.</P>
<P>  There may be substantial overlap between subsections (d)(1) (crime-fraud exception) and (d)(2) (this rule), but the underlying policies are not the same.  The crime-fraud exception is designed to promote the rectification of client fraud committed in exploitation of legal consultation; the present rule, on the other hand, relaxes the privilege bar to enable the lawyer to try to prevent the crime or fraud.</P>
<P>  Subsection (d)(7):  This new rule recognizes that, in the exercise of their professional responsibility and in complying with applicable professional norms, lawyers may be duty bound to divulge what would otherwise constitute confidential information covered by Rule 503.  In such instances the privilege should yield.  Most such revelations would not be testimonial, and so the privilege, which applies only in court proceedings, see Rules 101 and 1101, would strictly speaking not be a bar.  Just such an analysis likely explains the failure of the former rule to countenance revelation of a client's intent to commit a serious crime.  On the other hand, many lawyers believe that Rule 503 expresses policy that should carry over and inform the exercise of professional obligations and norms.  This rule makes clear that the privilege will yield to the professional duty.</P>

<P>  When a prosecutor seeks arguably privileged testimony, the prosecutor must either (1) give notice to the person who might claim the privilege and the person's counsel, so that the person or the person's attorney can seek judicial review of any claim or privilege or waive the privilege, or (2) give notice to the person's counsel and, if the person's counsel does not raise the privilege and seek judicial review, the prosecutor must seek the court's ruling on the privilege issue.  97 H. 512, 40 P.3d 914.</P>
