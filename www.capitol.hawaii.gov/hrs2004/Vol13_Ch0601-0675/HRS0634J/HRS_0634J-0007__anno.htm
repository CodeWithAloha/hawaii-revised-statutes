<P>  Chapter 634J and this section are applicable where a party seeks to maintain litigation in an existing case, such as by the filing of a motion, as well as to the filing of an entirely new case.  102 H. 289, 75 P.3d 1180.</P>
<P>  Where vexatious litigant was only restrained from bringing unmeritorious litigation, which could be restricted in any event, litigant's due process right not impacted in present or future cases; as trial court held a hearing to review litigant's objections to prefiling order, order imposed on litigant under this section satisfied procedural due process because it afforded litigant notice and an opportunity to be heard.  102 H. 289, 75 P.3d 1180.</P>
<P>  Subsection (a) prefiling order prohibiting a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in state courts intended to apply only to pro se litigants.  98 H. 95 (App.), 43 P.3d 232.</P>
