Bid security shall be a bond provided by a surety company authorized to do business in the State, or the equivalent in cash, or otherwise supplied in a form specified in rules.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least five per cent of the amount of the bid.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Unless, pursuant to rules, it is determined that a failure to provide bid security is nonsubstantial, all bids required to be accompanied by bid security shall be rejected when not accompanied by the required bid security.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  After the bids are opened, they shall be irrevocable for the period specified in the invitation for bids, except as provided in section 103D-302(g).
