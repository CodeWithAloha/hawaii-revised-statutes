At least annually, the chief of police shall give public notice to the public, once a week for four successive weeks in the county (and may also give notice by posting in conspicuous places), that, unless claimed by an owner with satisfactory proof of ownership, the goods, wares, and merchandise listed will be sold at public auction to the highest bidder.  On the day and at the place specified in the notice, all property still unclaimed, except money and found property, shall be sold by auction by or under the direction of the chief of police.  Any unclaimed goods, wares, or merchandise of a perishable nature or which are unreasonably expensive to keep or safeguard, may be sold at public auction or by any commercially reasonable manner, at a time and after notice that the chief of police deems proper and reasonable under the circumstances.  The chief of police, immediately after the sale of any property in accordance with this section, shall pay to the director of finance of the county all moneys remaining unclaimed and all moneys received upon the sale.
