</B>
<P>  Where county officials assured developer that developer's plans met zoning requirements and developer expended substantial sum in reliance, the city was estopped from denying developer a building permit under a subsequently enacted ordinance.  60 H. 446, 592 P.2d 26.</P>
<P>  Section does not relate to a city's executive, legislative and administrative structure and organization; zoning by initiative is impermissible.  70 H. 480, 777 P.2d 244.</P>
<P>  Public utilities commission has the authority to regulate the height of utility poles.  72 H. 285, 814 P.2d 398.</P>
<P>  As state water code expressly reserves the counties' authority with respect to land use planning and policy, water resource management commission allegedly imposing a "directive" on the counties to designate priorities among proposed uses did not usurp counties' land use planning and zoning authority.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</P>
<P>  Rezoning is a legislative function; a zoning ordinance is a legislative act and is subject to the deference given legislative acts.  102 H. 465, 78 P.3d 1.</P>
<P>  Grandfather protections afforded a property owner under this section and land use ordinance intended to prohibit new zoning ordinances from interfering with an owner's lawful uses of a building or premises under an existing zoning ordinance.  86 H. 343 (App.), 949 P.2d 183.</P>
<P>  "Lawful use" and "previously lawful", as used in this section and land use ordinance, respectively, refer to compliance with previous zoning laws, not the building codes or other legal requirements that may be applicable to the construction or operation of a structure.  86 H. 343 (App.), 949 P.2d 183.</P>
