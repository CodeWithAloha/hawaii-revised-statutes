<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§115-5]  Transit area and public transit corridor defined.</B>  The right of transit along the shoreline exists below the private property line which is defined as being along the upper reaches of the wash of waves, usually evidenced by the edge of vegetation or by the debris left by the wash of waves.  However, in areas of cliffs or areas where the nature of the topography is such that there is no reasonably safe transit for the public along the shoreline below the private property lines, the counties by condemnation shall establish along the makai boundaries of the property lines public transit corridors which shall be not less than six feet wide. [L 1974, c 244, §5]</P>
