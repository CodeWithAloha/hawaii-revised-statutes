<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§48E-11  Special purpose revenue bonds not a general obligation of county.</B>  No holder or holders of any special purpose revenue bonds issued under this chapter shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of taxing power of the county to pay such bonds or the interest thereon.  No special purpose revenue bond shall be secured, directly or indirectly, by the general credit of the county or by any revenues or taxes of the county, other than receipts derived from the project agreement with respect to the pollution control project for which such bonds have been issued or from any security for such project agreement, and no moneys other than such receipts shall be applied to the payment thereof.  Each special purpose revenue bond issued under this chapter shall recite in substance that such bond, including interest thereon, is not a general obligation of the county and is payable from the receipts pledged to the payment thereof, and that such bond is not secured directly or indirectly by the full faith and credit or the general credit of the county or by any revenues or taxes of the county other than the revenues specifically pledged thereto.
