<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§50-6  Duties and functions of commissions.</B>  The charter commission shall study and analyze the existing governmental structure of the county for the purpose of securing information that will enable it to draft a proposed charter adapted to the requirements of the county and designed to provide for the people of the county, a more efficient and responsible form of government.  The study of any subject relevant to the government, property, or other affairs of the county, or of the laws relating thereto, or of any matter or thing deemed by the commission to be pertinent thereto, and consistent with the purpose for which the commission was created, shall be deemed within the scope of the commission's work.  If, after its study, the commission decides that a charter is not desirable, it shall so report to the legislative body of the county and by resolution of the legislative body of the county the commission shall be dissolved.  If, however, the commission decides to draft a charter, the charter shall set forth the structure of the county government, the manner in which it is to operate, the powers of the county in local affairs, and shall provide for orderly transition from the present government to government under the charter. [L 1963, c 73, pt of §2; Supp, §143A-6; HRS §50-6]</P>
