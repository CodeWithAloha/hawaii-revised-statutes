<P>&#9;(b)  Any election of a mode of retirement shall be irrevocable and subject to the spousal or reciprocal beneficiary notification requirement under subsection (c).</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No election under this section shall take effect unless:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of the member is furnished written notification that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Specifies the retirement date, the benefit option selected, and the beneficiary designated by the member;</P>

</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The member selects option A or option B and designates the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary as the beneficiary; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;It is established to the satisfaction of the board that the notice required under paragraph (1) cannot be provided because:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;There is no spouse or reciprocal beneficiary;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be located;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;Of other reasons, as established by rules of the board pursuant to chapter 91.  Any notice provided to a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or determination that the notification of a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be provided, shall be effective only with respect to that spouse or reciprocal beneficiary.

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  Each member, within a reasonable period of time before the member's retirement date, shall be provided a written explanation of:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The terms and conditions of the various benefit options;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The rights of the member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary under subsection (c) to be notified of the member's election of a benefit option; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The member's right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an election of a benefit option.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  The system shall not be liable for any false statements made by the member.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  In the event of the death of a member after the date of the filing of the member's written application to retire, but prior to the retirement date designated by the member, the designated beneficiary, if the member was eligible to retire on the date of the member's death, may elect to receive either:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;An allowance that would have been payable if the member had retired and had elected to receive a retirement allowance under option B; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The allowance under the option selected by the member which would have been payable had the member retired.</P></DIR>

The election may not be made if, at the time of the member's death, there are individuals who are eligible to receive death benefits under section 88-286(c) who have made a claim for the benefits; provided that, if the designated beneficiary is an individual eligible to receive benefits under section 88-286(c), the designated beneficiary may receive benefits pursuant to an election under this section pending disposition of the claim for benefits under section 88-286(c).  No death benefits will be payable under section 88-286(c) while benefits are paid pursuant to an election made under this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  In the event of the death of the retirant within one year after the date of retirement, the retirant's beneficiary may elect to receive either:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The death benefit under the retirement option selected by the retirant; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The death benefit under option B; provided that the difference between the benefit that the retirant received and the benefit that would have been payable to the retirant had the retirant elected to receive a retirement allowance under option B shall be returned to the system.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(h)  The increase in the retirant's benefit under options A and B upon the death of the retirant's designated beneficiary shall be effective the first day of the month following the date of death of the designated beneficiary.  The retirant shall notify the system in writing and provide a certified copy of the beneficiary's death certificate.
