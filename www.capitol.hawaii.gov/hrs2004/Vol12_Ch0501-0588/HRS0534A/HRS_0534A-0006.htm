<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The governing instrument contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths or deaths in a common disaster and that language is operable under the facts of the case;</P>
<P>&#9;(2) &#9;The governing instrument expressly indicates that an individual is not required to survive an event, including the death of another individual, by any specified period or expressly requires the individual to survive the event for a specified period; but survival of the event or the specified period must be established by clear and convincing evidence;</P>
<P>&#9;(3) &#9;The imposition of a one hundred twenty-hour requirement of survival would cause a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment to fail to qualify for validity under section 525-1(a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) or to become invalid under section 525-1(a)(2), (b)(2), or (c)(2); but survival must be established by clear and convincing evidence; or</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The application of a one hundred twenty-hour requirement of survival to multiple governing instruments would result in an unintended failure or duplication of a disposition; but survival must be established by clear and convincing evidence.
