<P>  Department's rules implementing foster custody obligations of section were contrary to statutory purpose; section does not relieve department of duty to provide for needs of children taken into custody on basis of their relationship to foster parents.  73 H. 15, 827 P.2d 1144.</P>
<P>  Responsibility of department of human services discussed, where family court erred in concluding that adoption agreement, which allowed termination of foster board payments prior to completion of adoption process, violated public policy.  74 H. 409, 849 P.2d 55.</P>
<P>  Although child's failure to exhaust administrative remedies available under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act precluded family court from ordering health department to pay for child's mental health services, child's status as "ward of the state" created an independent state basis that obligated the State to pay, which the human services department, as child's co-custodian, was ultimately accountable for.  96 H. 272, 30 P.3d 878.</P>
<P>  As permanent custodian's "duties and rights of a legal custodian and family member" are subject to the ultimate control of the family court, court did not abuse discretion when it ordered that children not be removed from current foster family placements without prior court approval.  103 H. 130 (App.), 80 P.3d 20.</P>
<P>  As foster guardian of a minor child, the State may remove child from foster caretakers and place child with adoptive family without necessity of family court approval and without regard to fitness or stability of foster caretakers.  7 H. App. 547, 784 P.2d 873.</P>
