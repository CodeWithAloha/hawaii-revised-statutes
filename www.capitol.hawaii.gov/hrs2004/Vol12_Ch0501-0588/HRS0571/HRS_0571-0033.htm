<P>&#9;When a detention home is established as an agency of the court, the judge may appoint a director of detention services and other necessary employees for such home in the same manner as is provided by law for the appointment of other employees of the court.</P>
<P>&#9;A detention home established in any circuit may be used for the temporary detention of children or minors ordered to be detained by the court of another circuit.  The use shall be subject to the approval of the judge of the court of the circuit in which the detention home is situated, upon such terms and conditions as may be established by the judge.</P>
<P>&#9;The family court shall also provide nonsecure shelter facilities separate from detention facilities.  In referring minors to a nonsecure shelter, the court shall consider the minor's background, degree of involvement in illegal and antisocial activities, current behavioral patterns, and any other relevant criteria to determine placement.
