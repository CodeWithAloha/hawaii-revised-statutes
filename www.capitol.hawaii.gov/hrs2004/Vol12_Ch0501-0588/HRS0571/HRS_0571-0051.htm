<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§571-51  Support of minor committed for study or care.</B>  Whenever legal custody of a minor is given by the court to someone other than the minor's parents, or when a minor is given medical, psychological, or psychiatric study or treatment under order of the court, and no provision is otherwise made by law for the support of the minor or for payment for such treatment, compensation for the study and treatment of the minor, when approved by order of the court, shall, if necessary, be paid out of such moneys as may be appropriated for the expenses of the court.  After giving the parent a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the court may order and decree that the parent shall pay, in such manner as the court may direct, a reasonable sum that will cover in whole or in part the support and treatment of the minor given after the decree is entered.  If the parent wilfully fails or refuses to pay such sum, the court may proceed against the parent as for contempt, or the order may be filed and shall have the effect of a civil judgment. </P>
<P>&#9;Compensation may be made to a nongovernmental agency, provided that it shall make periodic reports to the court or to an agency designated by the court concerning the care and treatment the minor is receiving and the minor's response to such treatment.  These reports shall be made as frequently as the court deems necessary and shall be made with respect to every such minor at intervals not exceeding six months.  The agency shall also afford an opportunity for a representative of the court or of an agency designated by the court to visit, examine, or consult with the minor as frequently as the court deems necessary. [L 1965, c 232, pt of §1; Supp, §333-27; HRS §571-51; gen ch 1985]</P>
