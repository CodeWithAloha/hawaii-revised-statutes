If the requesting party is the mother or the alleged father, the court shall require that the request be made pursuant to a sworn statement.  The sworn statement made by the party must either:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Allege paternity setting forth facts establishing a reasonable possibility of the requisite sexual contact between the parties; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Deny paternity setting forth facts establishing a reasonable possibility of the non-existence of sexual contact between the parties.  The testing utilized must have a power of exclusion greater than ninety-nine point zero per cent (99.0%) and a minimum combined paternity index of five hundred to one, and shall be performed by an expert qualified as an examiner of genetic markers, appointed by the court.  The laboratory performing the testing shall be one approved by an accreditation body designated by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  The court, upon reasonable request by a party, shall order that independent tests be performed by other experts qualified as examiners of genetic markers.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In all cases, the court shall determine the number and qualifications of the experts.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  "Genetic test" means the testing of inherited or genetic characteristics (genetic markers) and includes blood testing for paternity purposes.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  In any trial brought under this chapter, a report of the facts and results of genetic tests ordered by the court under this chapter shall be admissible in evidence by affidavit of the person whose name is signed to the report, attesting to the procedures followed in obtaining the report.  A report of the facts and results of genetic tests shall be admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless objection is made.  The genetic testing performed shall be of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation bodies designated by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.  An alleged parent or party to the paternity action who objects to the admission of the report concerning the genetic test results must file a motion no later than twenty days after receiving a copy of the report and shall show good cause as to why a witness is necessary to lay the foundation for the admission of the report as evidence.  The court may, sua sponte, or at a hearing on the motion determine whether a witness shall be required to lay the foundation for the admission of the report as evidence.  The right to call witnesses to rebut the report is reserved to all parties.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Should an original test result be contested, the court shall order further genetic testing with payment of the testing to be advanced and paid for by the contesting party.
