<P>&#9;(b)  If it is claimed or appears to the court that the rental agreement or any provision thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its setting, purpose, and effect to aid the court in making the determination. </P>
<P>&#9;(c)  For the purposes of this section, an act or practice expressly permitted by this chapter is not in itself unconscionable. [L 1972, c 132, pt of §1]</P>
