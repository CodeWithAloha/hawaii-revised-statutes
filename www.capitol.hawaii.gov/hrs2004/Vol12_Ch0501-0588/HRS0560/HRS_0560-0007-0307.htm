In any event and notwithstanding lack of full disclosure a trustee who has issued a final account or statement received by the beneficiary and has informed the beneficiary of the location and availability of records for the beneficiary's examination is protected after three years.  A beneficiary is deemed to have received a final account or statement if accorded notice pursuant to section 560:1-401. [L 1976, c 200, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]</P>
