<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§560:5-112  Termination of or change in guardian's or conservator's appointment.  </B>(a)  The appointment of a guardian or conservator terminates upon the death, resignation, or removal of the guardian or conservator or upon termination of the guardianship or conservatorship.  A resignation of a guardian or conservator is effective when approved by the applicable court.  An appointment by a parent, spouse, or reciprocal beneficiary as guardian under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.  Termination of the appointment of a guardian or conservator does not affect the liability of either for previous acts or the obligation to account for money and other assets of the ward or protected person.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  A ward, protected person, person interested in the welfare of a ward or protected person, or governmental agency may petition for removal of a guardian or conservator on the ground that removal would be in the best interest of the ward or protected person or for other good cause.  A guardian or conservator may petition for permission to resign.  A petition for removal or permission to resign may include a request for appointment of a successor guardian or conservator.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The court may appoint an additional guardian or conservator at any time, to serve immediately or upon some other designated event, and may appoint a successor guardian or conservator in the event of a vacancy or make the appointment in contemplation of a vacancy, to serve if a vacancy occurs.  An additional or successor guardian or conservator may file an acceptance of appointment at any time after the appointment, but not later than thirty days after the occurrence of the vacancy or other designated event.  The additional or successor guardian or conservator becomes eligible to act on the occurrence of the vacancy or designated event, or the filing of the acceptance of appointment, whichever last occurs.  A successor guardian or conservator succeeds to the predecessor's powers, and a successor conservator succeeds to the predecessor's title to the protected person's assets.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Notwithstanding section 560:1-401, the court, without a hearing, may remove or accept the resignation of a guardian and appoint the public guardian under chapter 551A as a temporary or successor guardian upon the filing of a petition with notice by regular mail to the last known address of those persons entitled to notice in section 560:5-309 and upon such instructions as the court deems necessary.
