<P>&#9;(b)  On petition of a ward, a guardian, or another person interested in the ward's welfare, the court may terminate a guardianship if the ward no longer needs the assistance or protection of a guardian.  The court may modify the type of appointment or powers granted to the guardian if the extent of protection or assistance previously granted is currently excessive or insufficient or the ward's capacity to provide for support, care, education, health, and welfare has so changed as to warrant that action.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Except as otherwise ordered by the court for good cause, the court, before terminating a guardianship, shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the ward that apply to a petition for guardianship.  Upon presentation by the petitioner of evidence establishing a prima facie case for termination, the court shall order the termination unless it is proven by clear and convincing evidence<B><I> </B></I>that continuation of the guardianship is in the best interest of the ward. [L 2004, c 161, pt of §1]</P>
