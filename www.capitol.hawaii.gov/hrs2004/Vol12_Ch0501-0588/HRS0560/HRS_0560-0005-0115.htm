<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§560:5-115  Guardian ad litem.</B>  At any stage of a proceeding, the court or the family court may appoint a guardian ad litem if the court or the family court determines that representation of the interest otherwise would be inadequate.  If not precluded by a conflict of interest, a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent several individuals or interests.  The court or the family court shall state on the record the duties of the guardian ad litem and its reasons for the appointment.  Persons appointed by the court or the family court, as applicable, to serve as guardians ad litem or to perform any other duties that may be requested by the court in guardianship and protective proceedings shall be compensated in the amounts, if any, that the court deems appropriate and reasonable.  Any such compensation shall be paid from the respondent's assets or other source under the jurisdiction of the court or the family court as it shall order. [L 2004, c 161, pt of §1]</P>
