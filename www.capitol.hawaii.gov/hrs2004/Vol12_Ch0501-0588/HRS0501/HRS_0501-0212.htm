Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to deprive the plaintiff of any tort claim which the plaintiff may have against any person for loss or damage, or deprivation of land, or of any estate or interest therein.  If the plaintiff elects to pursue the plaintiff's tort claim and also the plaintiff's contract claim under this chapter, the contract claim shall be continued to await the result of the tort claim or shall be deemed alternative thereto.
