If an employer fails to file such information in seven days, the director shall levy a penalty of not more than $10 for each delinquent request, unless the failure to file such information is excused by the director after a showing by such employer that such filing could not be made on the prescribed date therefor owing to conditions over which the employer had no control. [L 1971, c 109, §1(1); gen ch 1985]</P>
