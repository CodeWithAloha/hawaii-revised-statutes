</B>
<P>  Trial court was not authorized, under §706-605, to order defendant to pay restitution to the Honolulu police department for its drug "buy money" expenses where (1) it was unlikely that ordering defendant to pay restitution would aid defendant in developing a degree of self-respect and pride in knowing that defendant has righted the wrong committed; and (2) department did not qualify as a "crime victim" under this chapter and defendant's offenses did not qualify as a "violent crime" under §351-32.  93 H. 34 (App.), 995 P.2d 335.</P>
