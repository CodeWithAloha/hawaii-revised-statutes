<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§398-7]  Employment and benefits protection.  </B>(a)  Upon return from family leave, the employee shall be entitled to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced, or restored to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.  If, however, during a leave, the employer experiences a layoff or workforce reduction and the employee would have lost a position had the employee not been on family leave, the employee is not entitled to reinstatement in the former or equivalent position.  In such circumstances, the employee retains all rights, including seniority rights, pursuant to the good faith operation of a bona fide layoff and recall system.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The taking of family leave shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued before the date on which the leave commenced, except for any paid leave that may have been expended in conjunction with the family leave.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to entitle or deny any employee to the accrual of any seniority or employment benefits during any period of leave, or any right, employment benefit, or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave. [L 1991, c 328, pt of §1]</P>
