Supp. 1095.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff brought forth evidence of a continuing series of conduct which affected plaintiff and plaintiff's work environment; plaintiff's sexual harassment claims may proceed using the evidence, even though much of it predated limitations period; plaintiff may not rely on other proffered evidence because to extent those actions raised claims, statute of limitations had passed.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1224.</P>
<P>  Defendant could not be liable in defendant's individual capacity under paragraph (1)(A).  159 F. Supp. 2d 1211.</P>

<P>  Where record contained numerous instances of both physical and verbal conduct of a sexual nature by doctor towards complainant and others, complainant never solicited or incited doctor’s conduct, and conduct had effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work environment, there was sufficient evidence to support commission’s determination that doctor violated paragraph (1)(A) and Hawaii administrative rule §12-46-109(a)(3).  88 H. 10, 960 P.2d 1218.</P>
<P>  Based on definition of "employer" in §378-1, legislature intended all employers, regardless of size, to be subject to the provisions of this chapter, including paragraph (1)(A).  89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104.</P>
<P>  Employer’s policy of denying any extended leave during employee’s first year of employment violated Hawaii administrative rule §12-46-108, which was adopted to enforce the legislative mandate of paragraph (1)(A) and Hawaii’s constitutional prohibition against sex discrimination in the exercise of a person’s civil rights in employment.  89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff in age discrimination suit did not meet plaintiff's burden of establishing that defendant's articulated reason for taking adverse employment action against plaintiff was pretextual, and plaintiff did not give any other evidence that would give rise to a genuine issue of material fact, trial court properly granted summary judgment.  94 H. 368, 14 P.3d 1049.</P>
<P>  A compensation discrimination claim under paragraph (1) must satisfy the following three-part test:  (1) plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) defendant must then provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the pay differences; and (3) if defendant articulates such a reason, plaintiff must then show that the reason given by defendant is pretexual.  96 H. 408, 32 P.3d 52.</P>
<P>  A retaliation claim under paragraph (2) is subject to a three-part test:  (1) plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation; (2) defendant must then provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action; and (3) if defendant articulates such a reason, plaintiff must then show that the reason given by defendant is pretexual.  96 H. 408, 32 P.3d 52.</P>
<P>  To establish a "hostile environment" sexual harassment claim, claimant must show that he or she was subjected to sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct or visual forms of harassment of a sexual nature; the conduct was unwelcome, severe or pervasive, and had the purpose or effect of either unreasonably interfering with claimant's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; that claimant actually perceived the conduct as having such purpose or effect; and claimant's perception was objectively reasonable to a person of claimant's gender in same position.  97 H. 376, 38 P.3d 95.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff was, as a matter of law, unable to maintain a sex discrimination claim based on retaliation under paragraph (2) where allegations described by plaintiff did not involve any discrimination based on sex, and plaintiff clarified that female co-worker's conduct created a hostile work environment not only for plaintiff, but for plaintiff's staff, which included both males and females.  100 H. 149, 58 P.3d 1196.</P>
<P>  An employee may bring action against employer for intentional infliction of emotional distress caused by discrimination in violation of this section, and this action is not barred by exclusivity provision of §386-5.  87 H. 57 (App.), 951 P.2d 507.</P>
