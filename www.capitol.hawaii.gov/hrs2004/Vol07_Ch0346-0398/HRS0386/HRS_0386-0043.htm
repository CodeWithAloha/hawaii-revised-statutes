<P>&#9;To or for a child, (1) so long as unmarried, until attainment of the age of eighteen, or (2) so long as unmarried, until attainment of the age of twenty if the child is a full-time student at a high school, business school, technical school, or unmarried and under twenty-two years if the child is a full-time undergraduate student at a college, or (3) so long as unmarried, until termination of the child's incapability of self-support, or (4) until marriage, except that in the case of a married child under eighteen, weekly benefits shall continue during the period of actual dependency until attainment of the age of eighteen.</P>
