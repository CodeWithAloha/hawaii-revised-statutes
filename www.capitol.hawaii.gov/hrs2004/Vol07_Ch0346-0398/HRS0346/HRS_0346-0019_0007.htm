All such decisions shall be subject to federal laws and regulations currently or hereafter in effect.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The department may deny a person's application to adopt a child or children if either of the prospective adoptive parents was convicted of an offense for which incarceration is a sentencing option, and if the department finds by reason of the nature and circumstances of the crime that either of the prospective adoptive parents poses a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of the child or children.  Such denial may occur only after appropriate investigation, notification of results and planned action, and opportunity to meet and rebut the finding, all of which need not be conducted in accordance with chapter 91.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The department may authorize or contract for home studies of prospective adoptive parents for children under the department's custody by experienced social workers with specialized adoption experience. [L 2000, c 108, §1; am L 2003, c 95, §9(4)]</P>
