<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§346-239]  Required findings concerning postponed hearings.  </B>Except as otherwise provided, no hearing shall be delayed upon the grounds that a party other than the dependent adult is not present at the hearing or has not been served with a copy of the order for immediate protection or the petition, where reasonable efforts have been made to effect service and it would be detrimental to the dependent adult to postpone the proceedings until service can be made.  Whenever a hearing is delayed or postponed under this section, the court shall enter a finding that it will not be detrimental to the dependent adult and shall also specify what additional measures shall be undertaken to effect service. [L 1989, c 381, pt of §1; am L 1990, c 144, §1 and c 234, §9]</P>
