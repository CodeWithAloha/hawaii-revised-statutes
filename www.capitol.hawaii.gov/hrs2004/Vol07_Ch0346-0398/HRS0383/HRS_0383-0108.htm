The department of labor and industrial relations may therefore make such investigations, secure and transmit such information, make available such services and facilities, and exercise such of the other powers provided herein with respect to the administration of this chapter as it deems necessary or appropriate to facilitate the administration of any such unemployment compensation or public employment service law, and, in like manner, accept and utilize information, services, and facilities made available to this State by the agency charged with the administration of any such other unemployment compensation of public employment service law.</P>

<P>&#9;(c)  The officials of any state which extend a like comity to this State may bring action in the courts of this State to collect unemployment contributions, interest, and penalties due the state.  The certificate of the secretary of the state, or of the nearest equivalent official, that the officials are authorized to collect the contributions, penalties, and interest shall be conclusive evidence of the authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The attorney general may commence action in any other state by and in the name of the department to collect contributions, interest, and penalties legally due this State.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The attorney general may commence action in this State as agent for and on behalf of any other state which extends a like comity to this State to enforce judgments and liabilities for unemployment contributions, interest, and penalties due the state.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  If the agency which administers the employment security law of another state has overpaid unemployment benefits to an individual located in Hawaii and certifies to the department that the individual is liable under its law to repay the benefits and requests the department to recover the overpayment, the attorney general may commence action in the courts of this State to recover the overpayment as agent for and on behalf of the other state.  The courts of this State shall entertain the action to collect the overpayment.
