<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual there shall be considered among other factors and in addition to those enumerated in paragraph (3)(B), the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety, and morals, the individual's physical fitness and prior training, the individual's experience and prior earnings, the length of unemployment, the individual's prospects for obtaining work in the individual's customary occupation, the distance of available work from the individual's residence, and prospects for obtaining local work.  The same factors so far as applicable shall be considered in determining the existence of good cause for an individual's voluntarily leaving work under paragraph (1).</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;If as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Labor dispute.  For any week with respect to which it is found that unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which the individual is or was last employed; provided that this paragraph shall not apply if it is shown that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The individual is not participating in or directly interested in the labor dispute which caused the stoppage of work; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The individual does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or directly interested in the dispute; provided that if in any case separate branches of work, which are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises, are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the purpose of this paragraph, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other premises.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(5)&#9;If the department finds that the individual has within the twenty-four calendar months immediately preceding any week of unemployment made a false statement or representation of a material fact knowing it to be false or knowingly failed to disclose a material fact to obtain any benefits not due under this chapter, the individual shall be disqualified for benefits beginning with the week in which the department makes the determination and for each consecutive week during the current and subsequent twenty-four calendar months immediately following such determination, and such individual shall not be entitled to any benefit under this chapter for the duration of such period; provided that no disqualification shall be imposed if proceedings have been undertaken against the individual under section 383-141.</P>
