<P>&#9;If the funds are not wholly expended for such project, or if for any reason the project fails to become a federal-aid project, the director shall certify such fact to the comptroller and director of finance of the State and to the council of the county concerned, and such funds or the unexpended balance thereof, as the case may be, shall, upon the certification immediately resume the former status thereof, and shall be retransferred to the proper fund, or to the county, as the case may be, to which it formerly belonged.
