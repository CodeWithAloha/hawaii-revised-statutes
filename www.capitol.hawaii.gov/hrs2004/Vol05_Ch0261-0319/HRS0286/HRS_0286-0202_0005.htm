This program shall provide a system for continuous driver evaluation and annual driver safety courses approved by the director.  For drivers with five years of continuous employment with one employer, this requirement shall be at least once every two years.  Every job placement center through which a driver who drives a motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of ten thousand pounds is employed on a casual or sporadic basis, and not as a regularly employed driver for any one employer, shall be responsible for providing the driver improvement program for all its drivers, who drive a motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of ten thousand pounds.  For purposes of this subsection only, "job placement center" means any place where persons may register for purposes of employment, and the dispatching of those persons to various jobs as they become available.  Any employer or job placement center that violates this subsection shall be fined not more than $500.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Every regularly or casually employed driver of a motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of ten thousand pounds shall attend the driver improvement program provided by the driver's employer or job placement center.  The director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary for the purposes of this subsection, including but not limited to rules governing attendance.  Any driver who does not fulfill the appropriate driver improvement attendance requirement shall be fined not more than $100.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The counties may furnish real property, facilities on that property, and other equipment in furtherance of this section.  A county may allow the use of that property or other county property to a third party examiner who has entered into an agreement with the county on terms that it deems proper and reasonable.
