When the examiner of drivers suspends a license under this section, the examiner shall immediately notify the licensee and afford the licensee a hearing.  After the hearing, the examiner of drivers may rescind the suspension, or the examiner may suspend the license for a further period or revoke the license.  Any person whose license has been suspended or revoked under this section may appeal under section 286-129. [L 1967, c 214, pt of §2; HRS §286-119; am L 1970, c 164, §3; gen ch 1985]</P>
