<P>&#9;<B>§269-91  [Definitions.]</B>  For the purposes of this [part]:</P>
<P>&#9;"Cost-effective" means the ability to produce or purchase electric energy or firm capacity, or both, from renewable energy resources at or below avoided costs.</P>
<P>&#9;"Electric utility company," means a public utility as defined under section 269-1, for the production, conveyance, transmission, delivery, or furnishing of power.</P>
<P>&#9;"Renewable energy" means electrical energy produced by wind, solar energy, hydropower, landfill gas, waste to energy, geothermal resources, ocean thermal energy conversion, wave energy, biomass, including municipal solid waste, biofuels, or fuels derived from organic sources, hydrogen fuels derived from renewable energy, or fuel cells where the fuel is derived from renewable sources.  Where biofuels, hydrogen, or fuel cell fuels are produced by a combination of renewable and nonrenewable means, the proportion attributable to the renewable means shall be credited as renewable energy.  Where fossil and renewable fuels are co-fired in the same generating unit, the unit shall be considered to produce renewable electricity in direct proportion to the percentage of the total heat value represented by the heat value of the renewable fuels.  "Renewable energy" also means electrical energy savings brought about by the use of solar and heat pump water heating, seawater air-conditioning district cooling systems, solar air-conditioning and ice storage, quantifiable energy conservation measures, use of rejected heat from co-generation and combined heat and power systems excluding fossil-fueled qualifying facilities that sell electricity to electric utility companies, and central station power projects.</P>
<P>&#9;"Renewable portfolio standard" means the percentage of electrical energy sales that is represented by renewable energy. [L 2001, c 272, §2; am L 2004, c 95, §4]</P>
