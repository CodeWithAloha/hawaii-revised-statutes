These procedures shall include criminal history record checks in accordance with section 846-2.7.  The private school and designated organization shall establish safeguards and procedures to protect against inadvertent or inappropriate disclosure of information obtained under this section.  The fee charged by the Hawaii criminal justice data center to perform criminal history record checks may be passed on to the applicant for employment by the private school or designated organization.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Information obtained pursuant to this section shall be used exclusively by the private school or designated organization for the purpose of determining whether a person is suitable for working in close proximity to children.  All decisions shall be subject to federal laws and regulations currently or hereafter in effect.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Private schools may refuse to employ or may terminate the employment of an employee or applicant for employment if the person has been convicted of an offense for which incarceration is a sentencing option, and if the private school finds by reason of the nature and circumstances of the crime that the person poses a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of children.  Refusal or termination may occur only after appropriate investigation, notification to the employee or applicant for employment of results and planned action, and after the employee or applicant for employment is given an opportunity to meet and rebut the finding.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The State, the Hawaii criminal justice data center, and their respective officers and employees, shall be immune from civil liability for any official act, decision, or omission performed pursuant to this section that is not the result of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
