<P>  L 2004, c 202, §82 provides:</P>
<P>  "SECTION 82.  Appeals pending in the supreme court as of the effective date of this Act [July 1, 2006] may be transferred to the intermediate appellate court or retained at the supreme court as the chief justice, in the chief justice's sole discretion, directs."</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Given that the "aggrieved party" provision of subsection (e) did not apply to the case, supreme court had jurisdiction to hear competitor's appeal; competitor appealed from a final order of the public utilities commission and from the commission's denial of competitor's motion for reconsideration; thus, competitor satisfied the requirements of subsection (e) and §271-33.  104 H. 98, 85 P.3d 623.</P>
<P>  The qualifying clause in subsection (e) neither limits appeals to "contested" cases nor limits appeals to hearings held pursuant to §271-31; subsection (e) is intended to apply only in the event that the public utilities commission conducts a contested case hearing, limiting standing to the "aggrieved" party in that hearing.  104 H. 98, 85 P.3d 623.</P>
