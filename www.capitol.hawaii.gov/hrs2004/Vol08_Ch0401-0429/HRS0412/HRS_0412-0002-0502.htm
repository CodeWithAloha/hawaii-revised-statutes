The solicitation may be by private letter, by personal contact, or by publication, as in the commissioner's discretion may be appropriate in order to obtain as many fair offers as possible with the least danger to the safety of the failing financial institution, its depositors and creditors, and the general public.  The commissioner may disclose information concerning the failing financial institution as shall be necessary for the prospective applicants to formulate a proposal to purchase; provided that the recipients of the information shall be required to keep the information confidential.
