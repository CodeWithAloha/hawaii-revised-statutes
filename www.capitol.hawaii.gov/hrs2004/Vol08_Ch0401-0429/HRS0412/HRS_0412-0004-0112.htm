<P>&#9;(1)&#9;To the State, if credited to the State or to the official credit of the director of finance;</P>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;To the government of any state or foreign country, or any territory or possession thereof, or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or municipalities, in which the pledging financial institution has a branch office, if credited to such government or to the official credit of the treasurer or similar fiscal officer thereof;</P>

If such assets are not so returned, the financial institution shall have its appropriate remedies at law and in equity, including, in the case of the State or any county of the State, the remedies under chapter 38; provided, that nothing in this subsection shall permit the avoidance of any requirements or liabilities imposed on the State or any county under chapter 38.
