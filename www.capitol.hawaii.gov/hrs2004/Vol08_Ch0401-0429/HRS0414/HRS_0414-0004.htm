<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§414-4  Notice.</B>  (a)  Notice under this chapter shall be in writing unless oral notice is reasonable under the circumstances.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Notice is effective if communicated in person; by telephone, telegraph, teletype, or other form of wire or wireless communication; or by mail or private carrier.  If these forms of personal notice are impracticable, notice may be communicated by a newspaper of general circulation in the area where published; or by radio, television, or other form of public broadcast communication.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Written notice by a domestic or foreign corporation to its shareholder, if in a comprehensible form, is effective when mailed, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed to the shareholder's address shown in the corporation's current record of shareholders.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Written notice to a domestic or foreign corporation (authorized to transact business in this State) may be addressed to its registered agent at its registered office or to the corporation or its secretary at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or, in the case of a foreign corporation that has not yet delivered an annual report, in its application for a certificate of authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Except as provided in subsection (c), written notice, if in a comprehensible form, is effective at the earliest of the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;When received;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Five days after its deposit in the United States mail, as evidenced by the postmark, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;On the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(f)  Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  If this chapter prescribes notice requirements for particular circumstances, those requirements govern.  If articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe notice requirements not inconsistent with this section or other provisions of this chapter, those requirements govern.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to shareholders, notice to shareholders given by the corporation under this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws shall be effective if provided by electronic transmission consented to by the shareholder to whom the notice is given.  Any consent shall be revocable by the shareholder by written notice to the corporation.  Any consent shall be deemed revoked if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The inability to deliver becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for giving notice; provided that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(i)  Notice given pursuant to subsection (h) shall be deemed given:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;If by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the shareholder of such specific posting, upon the later of the posting and the giving of such separate notice; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;If by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the shareholder.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>An affidavit of the secretary, assistant secretary, transfer agent, or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission, in the absence of fraud, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
