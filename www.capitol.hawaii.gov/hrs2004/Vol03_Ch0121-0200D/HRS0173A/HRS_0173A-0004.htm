Such acquisition is hereby declared to be for a public use.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The board may, subject to chapter 171 and with the approval of the governor, sell, lease, or otherwise convey any such land subject to terms and conditions which it deems appropriate and which will insure that the transferee will not use the land in a manner which is inconsistent with the purposes for which it was acquired by the board.  Such terms and conditions shall run with the land and shall be binding on the transferee's heirs, successors, and assigns.  The board may seek enforcement of such terms and conditions in any court of appropriate jurisdiction. [L 1973, c 77, §4]</P>
