<P>  A vessel and its accompanying mooring and live-aboard permits are constitutionally protected "property", of which an individual may not be deprived without notice and an opportunity to be heard.  91 H. 1, 979 P.2d 586.</P>
<P>  State had no statutory basis upon which to charge fees for the impoundment and disposal of vessel under §200-44 or this section where vessel had not been repossessed and State had engaged in the negotiated sale of the vessel for a purchase price of $0.00.  91 H. 1, 979 P.2d 586.</P>
<P>  Where an owner's right to a hearing subsequent to impoundment of a derelict vessel was not clearly established under §200-48, this section, or other law at the time of state boating officers' actions, it was not unreasonable for officers to have believed it was lawful to dispose of vessel without a hearing; thus officers, in individual capacities, entitled to qualified immunity in 42 U.S.C. §1983 action.  91 H. 1, 979 P.2d 586.</P>
