<P>&#9;(j)  Every manufacturer, wholesaler, or jobber, upon the request of the commission, shall furnish to the commission, in the form requested, all documents, data, and information the commission may require to make its determination on zone price adjustments.

Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.</P>
<P>&#9;(k)  The maximum pre-tax wholesale gasoline price imposed by this section shall take effect on September 1, 2005, notwithstanding the lack of the adoption of rules pursuant to this section.</P>
