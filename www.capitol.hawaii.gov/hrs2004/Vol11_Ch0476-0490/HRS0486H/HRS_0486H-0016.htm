<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§486H-16  Adjustments.</B>  (a)  A manufacturer, wholesaler, or jobber may petition the commission to adjust the maximum pre-tax wholesale price of regular unleaded, mid-grade, or premium gasoline in the event of a change in the value of the baseline price for regular unleaded gasoline, the location adjustment factor, the marketing margin factor, the mid-grade adjustment factor, the premium adjustment factor, or a zone price adjustment.  The petitioner shall bear the burden of proof to establish by clear and convincing evidence the need for and the amount of any adjustment.  The adjustments shall be determined as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The value of the baseline price shall be equal to the average of:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The weekly average of the spot daily price for regular unleaded gasoline for Los Angeles;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The weekly average of the spot daily price for regular unleaded gasoline for New York Harbor; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;The weekly average of the spot daily price for regular unleaded gasoline for the United States Gulf Coast,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;as reported and published by the Oil Price Information Service for the five business days of the preceding week; provided that the commission, in its discretion, may determine a more appropriate baseline or a more appropriate price information reporting service;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The value of the location adjustment factor in effect at the time the petition is filed shall be adjusted to reflect the average of the actual acquisition cost to non-refiner marketers to obtain gasoline from refiners or importers for sale on the island of Oahu over the prior twelve-month period, which cost shall be taken from arm's length transactions between non-refiner marketers, and refiners or importers, such as exchange agreements, sales agreements, or other similar agreements; provided that the location adjustment factor shall not exceed the reasonable cost of importing gasoline to the island of Oahu.  As used in this paragraph, "actual acquisition cost" means the amount over the base price of regular unleaded gasoline that a non-refiner marketer pays to a third party for delivery of such gasoline into a terminal located on the island of Oahu;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The value of the marketing margin factor in effect at the time the petition is filed shall be adjusted by adding to such value the difference between:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The average of the difference over the prior twelve-month period between:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;The dealer tank wagon price for sales for resale for "regular" gasoline; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;The bulk price for sales for resale for "regular" gasoline,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;for Petroleum Administration for Defense (PAD) District V, as reported and published by the Energy Information Administration or its successor in Table 31 - "Motor Gasoline Prices by Grade, Sales Type, PAD District, and State" or other source containing the same information; less</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The average of the difference over the period from 1994 until the most current year between:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;The dealer tank wagon price for sales for resale for "regular" gasoline; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;The bulk price for sales for resale for "regular" gasoline,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;for Petroleum Administration for Defense (PAD) District V, as reported and published by the Energy Information Administration or its successor in Table 31 - "Motor Gasoline Prices by Grade, Sales Type, PAD District, and State" or other source containing the same information;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The value of the mid-grade and premium adjustment factors in effect at the time the petition is filed shall be adjusted by any material change in the mid-grade and premium adjustment factor as published by an appropriate price information reporting service; and</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The value of any zone price adjustment in effect at the time the petition is filed shall be adjusted based upon material changes in the operating costs for a zone, such as terminaling, storage, or distribution costs, and other empirical data the commission deems appropriate.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  If the commission adjusts the maximum pre-tax wholesale gasoline prices, the commission shall publish its findings and the adjusted prices by means that shall include the Internet website for the State of Hawaii.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Regardless of whether a petition has been filed and notwithstanding a determination of the adjustments made pursuant to subsection (a), the commission, in its discretion, may make such other and further adjustments deemed necessary and appropriate to establish maximum pre-tax wholesale gasoline prices that reflect and correlate with competitive market conditions.
