<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§481C-3  Balloon payments.</B>  With respect to any sale of goods purchased primarily for a personal, family or household purpose, which is subject to the provisions of this chapter, if any scheduled payment is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments, the buyer has the right to refinance the amount of that payment at the time it is due without penalty.  The terms of the refinancing shall be no less favorable to the buyer than the terms of the original sale.  These provisions do not apply to the extent that the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the buyer. [L 1976, c 32, pt of §5]</P>
