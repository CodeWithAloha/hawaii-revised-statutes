<P>&#9;(b)  Costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.  The court may award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party if (1) the party complaining of a deceptive trade practice has brought an action which the party knew to be groundless, or (2) the party charged with a deceptive trade practice has wilfully engaged in the trade practice knowing it to be deceptive. </P>
