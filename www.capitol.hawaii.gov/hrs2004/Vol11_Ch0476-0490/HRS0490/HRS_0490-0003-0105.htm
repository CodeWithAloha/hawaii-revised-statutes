<P>&#9;(b)  An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete instrument that is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer, but nonissuance is a defense.  An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  "Issuer" applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument. [L 1991, c 118, pt of §1]</P>
