<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§490:3-203  Transfer of instrument; rights acquired by transfer.</B>  (a)  An instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If a transferor purports to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of the instrument does not occur.  The transferee obtains no rights under this Article and has only the rights of a partial assignee. [L 1991, c 118, pt of §1]</P>
