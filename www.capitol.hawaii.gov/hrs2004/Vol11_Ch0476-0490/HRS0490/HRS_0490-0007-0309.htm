<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§490:7-309  Duty of care; contractual limitation of carrier's liability.</B>  (a)  A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall exercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances.  This subsection does not affect any statute, regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not caused by its negligence.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation agreement that the carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation agreement if the carrier's rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded an opportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity.  However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion to its own use.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or a transportation agreement. [L 2004, c 163, pt of §1]</P>
