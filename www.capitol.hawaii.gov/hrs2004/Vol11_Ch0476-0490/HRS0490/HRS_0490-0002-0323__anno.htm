<P>  <B>Prior</B> <B>Uniform</B> <B>Statutory</B> <B>Provision:</B>  None. </P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</B> </P>
<P>  1.  Subsection (1) follows the "American" rule that a regular bill of lading indicating delivery of the goods at the dock for shipment is sufficient, except under a term "F.O.B. vessel."  See Section 2-319 and comment thereto. </P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (2) deals with the problem of bills of lading covering deep water shipments, issued not as a single bill of lading but in a set of parts, each part referring to the other parts and the entire set constituting in commercial practice and at law a single bill of lading.  Commercial practice in international commerce is to accept and pay against presentation of the first part of a set if the part is sent from overseas even though the contract of the buyer requires presentation of a full set of bills of lading provided adequate indemnity for the missing parts is forthcoming. </P>
<P>  This subsection codifies that practice as between buyer and seller.  Article 5 (Section 5-113) authorizes banks presenting drafts under letters of credit to give indemnities against the missing parts, and this subsection means that the buyer must accept and act on such indemnities if he in good faith deems them adequate.  But neither this subsection nor Article 5 decides whether a bank which has issued a letter of credit is similarly bound.  The issuing bank's obligation under a letter of credit is independent and depends on its own terms.  See Article 5. </P>
