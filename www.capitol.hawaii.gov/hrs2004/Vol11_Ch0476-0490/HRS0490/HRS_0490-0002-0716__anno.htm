<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Rephrased.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes</B> <B>of</B> <B>Changes:</B>  To make it clear that:</P>
<P>  1.  The present section continues in general prior policy as to specific performance and injunction against breach.  However, without intending to impair in any way the exercise of the court's sound discretion in the matter, this Article seeks to further a more liberal attitude than some courts have shown in connection with the specific performance of contracts of sale.</P>
<P>  2.  In view of this Article's emphasis on the commercial feasibility of replacement, a new concept of what are "unique" goods is introduced under this section.  Specific performance is no longer limited to goods which are already specific or ascertained at the time of contracting.  The test of uniqueness under this section must be made in terms of the total situation which characterizes the contract.  Output and requirements contracts involving a particular or peculiarly available source or market present today the typical commercial specific performance situation, as contrasted with contracts for the sale of heirlooms or priceless works of art which were usually involved in the older cases.  However, uniqueness is not the sole basis of the remedy under this section for the relief may also be granted "in other proper circumstances" and inability to cover is strong evidence of "other proper circumstances".</P>
<P>  3.  The legal remedy of replevin is given the buyer in cases in which cover is reasonably unavailable and goods have been identified to the contract.  This is in addition to the buyer's right to recover identified goods on the seller's insolvency (Section 2-502).</P>
<P>  4.  This section is intended to give the buyer rights to the goods comparable to the seller's rights to the price.</P>
<P>  5.  If a negotiable document of title is outstanding, the buyer's right of replevin relates of course to the document not directly to the goods.  See Article 7, especially Section 7-602.</P>
