<P>&#9;(b)  A security interest does not exist in commingled goods as such.  However, a security interest may attach to a product or mass that results when goods become commingled goods.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If collateral becomes commingled goods, a security interest attaches to the product or mass.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If a security interest in collateral is perfected before the collateral becomes commingled goods, the security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c) is perfected.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c).</P>
