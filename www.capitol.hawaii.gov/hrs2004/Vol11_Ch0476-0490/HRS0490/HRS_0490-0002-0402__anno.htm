<P>  <B>Purposes</B> <B>of</B> <B>Changes</B> <B>and</B> <B>New</B> <B>Matter:</B>  To avoid confusion on ordinary issues between current sellers and buyers and issues in the field of preference and hindrance by making it clear that:</P>
<P>  1.  Local law on questions of hindrance of creditors by the seller's retention of possession of the goods are outside the scope of this Article, but retention of possession in the current course of trade is legitimate.  Transactions which fall within the law's policy against improper preferences are reserved from the protection of this Article.</P>
<P>  2.  The retention of possession of the goods by a merchant seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification in current course is exempted from attack as fraudulent.  Similarly, the provisions of subsection (3) have no application to identification or delivery made in the current course of trade, as measured against general commercial understanding of what a "current" transaction is.</P>
