<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 21, Uniform Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Completely rewritten.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</B>  To make it clear that:</P>
<P>  1.  The auctioneer may in his discretion either reopen the bidding or close the sale on the bid on which the hammer was falling when a bid is made at that moment.  The recognition of a bid of this kind by the auctioneer in his discretion does not mean a closing in favor of such a bidder, but only that the bid has been accepted as a continuation of the bidding.  If recognized, such a bid discharges the bid on which the hammer was falling when it was made.</P>
<P>  2.  An auction "with reserve" is the normal procedure.  The crucial point, however, for determining the nature of an auction is the "putting up" of the goods.  This Article accepts the view that the goods may be withdrawn before they are actually "put up," regardless of whether the auction is advertised as one without reserve, without liability on the part of the auction announcer to persons who are present.  This is subject to any peculiar facts which might bring the case within the "firm offer" principle of this Article, but an offer to persons generally would require unmistakable language in order to fall within that section.  The prior announcement of the nature of the auction either as with reserve or without reserve will, however, enter as an "explicit term" in the "putting up" of the goods and conduct thereafter must be governed accordingly.  The present section continues the prior rule permitting withdrawal of bids in auctions both with and without reserve; and the rule is made explicit that the retraction of a bid does not revive a prior bid.</P>
