<P>  <B>Prior</B> <B>Uniform</B> <B>Statutory</B> <B>Provision:</B>  Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Completely rewritten by this and other sections of this Article.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes</B> <B>of</B> <B>Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  This section is intended to modify the former rule which required that "firm offers" be sustained by consideration in order to bind, and to require instead that they must merely be characterized as such and expressed in signed writings.</P>
<P>  2.  The primary purpose of this section is to give effect to the deliberate intention of a merchant to make a current firm offer binding.  The deliberation is shown in the case of an individualized document by the merchant's signature to the offer, and in the case of an offer included on a form supplied by the other party to the transaction by the separate signing of the particular clause which contains the offer.  "Signed" here also includes authentication but the reasonableness of the authentication herein allowed must be determined in the light of the purpose of the section.  The circumstances surrounding the signing may justify something less than a formal signature or initialing but typically the kind of authentication involved here would consist of a minimum of initialing of the clause involved.  A handwritten memorandum on the writer's letterhead purporting in its terms to "confirm" a firm offer already made would be enough to satisfy this section, although not subscribed, since under the circumstances it could not be considered a memorandum of mere negotiation and it would adequately show its own authenticity.  Similarly, an authorized telegram will suffice, and this is true even though the original draft contained only a typewritten signature.  However, despite settled courses of dealing or usages of the trade whereby firm offers are made by oral communication and relied upon without more evidence, such offers remain revocable under this Article since authentication by a writing is the essence of this section.</P>
<P>  3.  This section is intended to apply to current "firm" offers and not to long term options, and an outside time limit of three months during which such offers remain irrevocable has been set.  The three month period during which firm offers remain irrevocable under this section need not be stated by days or by date.  If the offer states that it is "guaranteed" or "firm" until the happening of a contingency which will occur within the three month period, it will remain irrevocable until that event.  A promise made for a longer period will operate under this section to bind the offeror only for the first three months of the period but may of course be renewed.  If supported by consideration it may continue for as long as the parties specify.  This section deals only with the offer which is not supported by consideration.</P>
<P>  4.  Protection is afforded against the inadvertent signing of a firm offer when contained in a form prepared by the offeree by requiring that such a clause be separately authenticated.  If the offer clause is called to the offeror's attention and he separately authenticates it, he will be bound; Section 2-302 may operate, however, to prevent an unconscionable result which otherwise would flow from other terms appearing in the form.</P>
<P>  5.  Safeguards are provided to offer relief in the case of material mistake by virtue of the requirement of good faith and the general law of mistake.</P>
