<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§490:8-103  Rules for determining whether certain obligations and interests are securities or financial assets.</B>  (a)  A share or similar equity interest issued by a corporation, business trust, joint stock company, or similar entity is a security.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  An "investment company security" is a security.  "Investment company security" means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that is so registered, or a face-amount certificate issued by a face-amount certificate company that is so registered.  Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this article, or it is an investment company security.  However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this article and not by article 3, even though it also meets the requirements of that article.  However, a negotiable instrument governed by article 3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  A commodity contract, as defined in section 490:9-102(a), is not a security or a financial asset. [L 1997, c 33, pt of §2; am L 2000, c 241, §22]</P>
