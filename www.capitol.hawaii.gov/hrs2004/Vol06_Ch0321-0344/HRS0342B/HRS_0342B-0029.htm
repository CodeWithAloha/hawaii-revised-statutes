<P>&#9;(c)  Fees for covered sources shall be based on the number of tons of regulated air pollutant, excluding carbon monoxide, allowed or emitted by the permitted source and shall not be less than $25 per ton per year.  A covered source shall not be assessed for emissions of a regulated air pollutant in excess of four thousand tons per year.</P>

The consumer price index for any calendar year is the average of the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the United States Department of Labor, as of the close of the twelve-month period ending on August&nbsp;31 of each calendar year.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Nothing in the cost-per-ton fee provisions of subsections (c) and (d) shall restrict the director from assessing more or less than the amount determined under subsections (c) and (d) from any one covered source or any class or category of covered sources, as designated by the director; provided the department collects a total amount of fees sufficient to cover the costs of the permit program.
