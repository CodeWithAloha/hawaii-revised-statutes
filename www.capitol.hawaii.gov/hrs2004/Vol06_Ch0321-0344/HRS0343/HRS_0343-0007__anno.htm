<P>  Court has no jurisdiction over actions initiated after time limit.  64 H. 126, 637 P.2d 776.</P>
<P>  Date of commission’s decision to grant SMA permit triggered time period for appeal, not date when commission made express determination that no environmental assessment was required for project; plaintiff’s challenge to lack of environmental assessment thus timely.  86 H. 66, 947 P.2d 378.</P>
<P>  Where the federal construct of a procedural right was not germane to case because this section, the statute at issue, establishes who and under what circumstances the lack of an environmental assessment, may be challenged, and federal cases recognizing this standard were inapposite because they rested on non-analogous statutes, petitioner could not be afforded so-called "procedural standing" under subsection (a).  100 H. 242, 59 P.3d 877.</P>
