<P>&#9;(b)  Prescription drugs are not appropriate for return-for-credit-and-reuse and shall not be returned for credit under this chapter under conditions which include but are not limited to the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Product valuation is less than the handling fee;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Market demand makes reuse implausible by the expiration date or use by date;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The product prescription number or patient identifier is not discernable, therefore credit to the payer is not possible; or</P>
