<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Coordination:  The programs shall demonstrate specific linkages with one another, and with the general treatment and social service system, as a whole.  These connections should not be limited to the mental health system, but shall include, whenever possible, community resources utilized by the general population.  To ensure coordination occurs, each program shall include a case management system in which the case manager serves as a coordinator to assure the cooperative operation of the various elements of the system and to act as an active advocate for the clients in the system.  The case manager shall assure that each client receives the appropriate type of service.  The case manager shall meet regularly with clients, work closely with program staff, and serve as an advocate.  The case manager shall work directly with the client and the system to assure continuity of care between the service elements of the system. [L 1980, c 221, pt of §2]</P>
