<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§342H-38]  Felony disposal of solid waste; deferred prosecution agreement.</B>  First time offenses for persons cited with felony disposal of solid waste may enter into a deferred prosecution agreement.  Persons failing to meet all of the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement shall be subject to prosecution under this section.</P>
<P>&#9;For the purposes of this section, a deferred prosecution agreement shall mean an agreement offered by the prosecutor, in the prosecutor's discretion, to the person cited that would defer prosecution during the statute of limitations period, subject to renewed prosecution if the defendant violates the conditions of the agreement.  The agreement, if one is offered, shall contain provisions reasonably calculated to deter future violations.  No person shall be offered a deferred prosecution agreement under this section more than once.  If all terms of the agreement are met, all records of the person's arrest, indictment, or plea shall be cleared.  Entering into a deferred prosecution agreement shall not be considered an admission of guilt. [L 2004, c 143, pt of §1]</P>
