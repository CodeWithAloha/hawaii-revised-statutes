<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The manufacturer or packer also supplies such substance in packages which comply with such standard; and </P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The packages of such substance which do not meet such standard bear conspicuous labeling stating:  &quot;This package for households without young children&quot;; except that the director may by rule prescribe a substitute statement to the same effect for packaging too small to accommodate such labeling. </P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  In the case of a household substance which is subject to such a standard and which is dispensed pursuant to an order of a physician, dentist, or other licensed medical practitioner authorized to prescribe, such substance may be dispensed in noncomplying packages only when directed in such order or when requested by the purchaser. </P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In the case of a household substance subject to such a standard which is packaged under subsection (a) in a noncomplying package, if the director determines that such substance is not also being supplied by a manufacturer or packer in popular size packages which comply with such standard, the director may, after giving the manufacturer or packer an opportunity to comply with the purposes of this chapter, by order require such substance to be packaged by such manufacturer or packer exclusively in special packaging complying with such standard if the director finds, after opportunity for hearing, that such exclusive use of special packaging is necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.
