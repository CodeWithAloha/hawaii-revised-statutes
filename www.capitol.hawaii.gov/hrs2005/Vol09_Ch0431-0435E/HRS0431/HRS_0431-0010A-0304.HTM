<P>&#9;(c)  The commissioner may adopt reasonable rules that specify prohibited policy provisions not otherwise specifically authorized by law, which, in the opinion of the commissioner, are unjust, unfair, or unfairly discriminatory to any person insured or proposed to be insured under any medicare supplement policy or certificate.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not exclude or limit benefits for losses incurred more than six months after the effective date of coverage because it involved a preexisting condition.  The policy or certificate shall not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician within six months before the effective date of coverage.
