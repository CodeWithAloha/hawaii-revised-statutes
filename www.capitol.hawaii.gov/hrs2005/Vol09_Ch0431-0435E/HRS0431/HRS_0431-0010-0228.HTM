<P>&#9;(b)  Subject to the terms of the policy, any policy providing the beneficiary may be changed upon the sole request of the insured, may be assigned by either pledge or transfer of title, executed by the insured alone, and delivered to the insurer, regardless of whether the insurer is the pledgee or assignee.  Any such assignment shall entitle the insurer to deal with the assignee as the owner or pledgee of the policy in accordance with the terms of the assignment until the insurer has received at its home office written notice of termination of the assignment or pledge, or written notice by or on behalf of some other person claiming some interest in the policy in conflict with the assignment.
