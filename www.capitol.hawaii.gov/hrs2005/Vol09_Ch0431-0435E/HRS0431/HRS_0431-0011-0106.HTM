<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§431:11-106  Standards and management of an insurer within a holding company system.</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>&#9;(a)&#9;(1)&#9;Transactions within a holding company system to which an insurer subject to registration is a party shall be subject to the following standards:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The terms shall be fair and reasonable;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;Expenses incurred and payment received shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;The books, accounts, and records of each party to all transactions shall be maintained so as to clearly and accurately disclose the nature and details of the transactions including the accounting information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(E)&#9;The insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its holding company system may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into the transaction at least thirty days prior thereto, or a shorter period as the commissioner may permit, and the commissioner has not disapproved it within that period:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, or extensions of credit, guarantees, or investments; provided that the transactions are equal to or exceed:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three per cent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five per cent of surplus as regards policyholders each as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;With respect to life insurers, three per cent of the insurer's admitted assets as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes the loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three per cent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five per cent of surplus as regards policyholders each as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;With respect to life insurers, three per cent of the insurer's admitted assets as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities equals or exceeds five per cent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(D)&#9;All management agreements, service contracts, and all cost-sharing arrangements; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(E)&#9;Any material transactions, specified by rule, which the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions, which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the holding company system, if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would otherwise occur.  If the commissioner determines that the separate transactions were entered into over any twelve-month period for that purpose, the commissioner may exercise the commissioner's authority under section 431:11-111.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (a)(2), shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a)(1) and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The commissioner shall be notified within thirty days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds ten per cent of the corporation's voting securities.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;(1)&#9;No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within the period disapproved the payment; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The commissioner has approved the payment within the thirty-day period.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Ten per cent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The net gain from operations of a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve-month period ending the thirty-first day of December next preceding.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;Extraordinary dividend or distribution shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities.</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends.  This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the commissioner's approval thereof, and the declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until the commissioner has either approved the payment of the dividend or distribution or has not disapproved the payment within the thirty-day period referred to above.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)&#9;(1)&#9;Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability which they would otherwise be subject to by law.  The insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this article.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with one or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection (a)(1).</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  For purposes of this article, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The number and size of risks insured in each line of business;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's investment portfolio;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;The adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and</P>
<P>&#9;(10)&#9;The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates.  The commissioner may treat any investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in the commissioner's judgment the investment so warrants.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  In determining the adequacy and reasonableness of an</P>
<P>insurer's surplus, no single factor is necessarily controlling,</P>
<P>and the commissioner shall:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Consider the net effect of all of the factors, along with other factors bearing on the financial condition of the insurer;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;In comparing the surplus maintained by other insurers, consider the extent to which each of these factors varies among insurers; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;In determining the quality and liquidity of investments in subsidiaries, consider the individual subsidiary and discount or disallow its valuation to the extent warranted by individual investments.
