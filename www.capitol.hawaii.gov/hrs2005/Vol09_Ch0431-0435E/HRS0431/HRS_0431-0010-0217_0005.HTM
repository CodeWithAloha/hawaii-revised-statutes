<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§431:10-217.5]</B>  <B>Policies relating to domestic abuse cases.</B>  (a)  No insurer shall deny or refuse to accept an application for insurance, refuse to insure, refuse to renew, cancel, restrict, or otherwise terminate a policy of insurance, or charge a different rate for the same coverage, on the basis that the applicant or insured person is, has been, or may be a victim of domestic abuse.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Nothing in this section shall prevent an insurer from taking any of the actions set forth in subsection (a) on the basis of loss history or medical condition or for any other reason not otherwise prohibited by this section, any law, regulation, or rule.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Any form filed or filed after July 15, 1998 or subject to a rule adopted under chapter 91 may exclude coverage for losses caused by intentional or fraudulent acts of any insured.  Such an exclusion, however, shall not apply to deny an insured's otherwise-covered property loss if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The property loss is caused by an act of domestic abuse by another insured under the policy;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The insured claiming property loss files a police report and cooperates with any law enforcement investigation relating to the act of domestic abuse; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The insured claiming property loss did not cooperate in or contribute to the creation of the property loss.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;Payment by the insurer to an insured may be limited to the person's insurable interest in the property less payments made to a mortgagee or other party with a legal secured interest in the property.  An insurer making payment to an insured under this section has all rights of subrogation to recover against the perpetrator of the act that caused the loss.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Nothing in this section prohibits an insurer from investigating a claim and complying with chapter 431.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  As used in this section, "domestic abuse" means:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the infliction of fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault between family or household members;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Sexual assault of one family or household member by another;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Stalking of one family or household member by another family or household member; or</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing damage to property so as to intimidate or attempt to control the behavior of another household member. [L 1998, c 171, §2]</P>
