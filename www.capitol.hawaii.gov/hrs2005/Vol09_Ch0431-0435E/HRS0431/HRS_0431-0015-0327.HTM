<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§431:15-327  Special claims.</B>  (a)  The claim of a third party which is contingent only on first obtaining a judgment against the insured shall be considered and allowed as if there were no such contingency.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Any claim that would have become absolute if there had been no termination of coverage under section 431:15-308, and that was not covered by insurance acquired to replace the terminated coverage, shall be allowed as if the coverage had remained in effect, unless at least ten days before the insured event occurred either the claimant had actual notice of the termination or notice was mailed to the claimant as prescribed by section 431:15-311.  If allowed, the claim shall share in distributions under section 431:15-332(7).</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A claim may be allowed even if it is contingent, if it is filed in accordance with section 431:15-326(b).  It may be allowed and may participate in all distributions declared after it is filed, to the extent that it does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Claims that are due except for the passage of time are treated as absolute claims, except that where justice requires the liquidator may discount them at the rate of interest available on United States treasury securities of approximately the same maturity.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  A guaranty fund or association, or foreign guaranty association may file a claim with the liquidator for all claims to which the fund or association has been subrogated.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Claims made under employment contracts by directors, principal officers, or persons who, in fact, perform similar functions or have similar powers, are limited to payment for services rendered prior to the issuance of any order of rehabilitation or liquidation under section 431:15-302 or section 431:15-307.
