<P>&#9;"Disciplined current scale" means a scale of nonguaranteed elements constituting a limit on illustrations currently being illustrated by an insurer that is reasonably based on actual recent historical experience, as certified annually by an illustration actuary designated by the insurer.  Further guidance in determining the disciplined current scale as contained in standards established by the Actuarial Standards Board may be relied upon if the standards:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Are consistent with all provisions of this part;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Limit a disciplined current scale to reflect only actions that have already been taken or events that have already occurred;</P>

<P>&#9;"Lapse-supported illustration" means an illustration of a policy form failing the test of self-supporting illustration as defined in this part, under a modified persistency rate assumption using persistency rates underlying the disciplined current scale for the first five years and one hundred per cent policy persistency thereafter.</P>

For this purpose, policy owner value shall include cash surrender values and any other illustrated benefit amounts available at the policy owner's election.</P>
<P>&#9;"Supplemental illustration" means an illustration furnished in addition to a basic illustration that meets the applicable requirements of this part, and that may be presented in a format differing from the basic illustration, but may only depict a scale of nonguaranteed elements that is permitted in a basic illustration.
