<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The agents eligible for insurance under the policy shall be those who are under contract to render personal services for the principal for a commission or other fixed or ascertainable compensation.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The policy must insure either all of the agents or all of any class or classes thereof, except that if a policy is intended to insure several such classes it may be issued to insure any such class of which seventy-five per cent are covered and extended to other classes as seventy-five per cent thereof express the desire to be covered.</P>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The amounts of insurance shall be based upon some plan which will preclude individual selection.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The insurance shall be for the benefit of persons other than the principal.</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The policy shall terminate if, subsequent to issue the number of agents insured falls below twenty-five lives or seventy-five per cent of the number eligible and the contribution of the agents, if the premiums are on a renewable term insurance basis, exceed $1 per month per $1,000 of insurance coverage plus any additional premium per $1,000 of insurance coverage charged to cover one or more hazardous occupations.</P>
