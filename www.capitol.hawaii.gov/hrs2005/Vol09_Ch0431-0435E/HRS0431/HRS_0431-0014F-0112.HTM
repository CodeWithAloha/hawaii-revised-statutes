<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§431:14F-112]  Penalties.</B>  (a)  If the commissioner finds that any person or organization has violated any provision of this article, the commissioner may impose a penalty of not more than $500 for each violation; provided that if the commissioner finds the violation to be wilful, the commissioner may impose a penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation.  The penalties may be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.  For purposes of this section, any managed care plan using a rate for which the managed care plan has failed to file the rate, supplementary rating information, underwriting rules or guides, or supporting information as required by this article, shall have committed a separate violation for each day the failure to file continues.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The commissioner may suspend the license or operating authority of any managed care plan that fails to comply with an order of the commissioner within the time limited by the order, or any extension thereof that the commissioner may grant.  The commissioner shall not suspend the license of any managed care plan for failure to comply with an order until the time prescribed for an appeal from the order has expired or, if an appeal has been taken, until the order has been affirmed.  The commissioner may determine when a suspension of license or operating authority shall become effective and it shall remain in effect for the period fixed by the commissioner unless the commissioner modifies or rescinds the suspension, or until the order upon which the suspension is based is modified, rescinded, or reversed.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No penalty shall be imposed and no license or operating authority shall be suspended or revoked except upon a written order of the commissioner, stating the commissioner's findings, made after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice to the person or organization.  The notice shall specify the alleged violation. [L 2002, c 74, pt of §2]</P>
