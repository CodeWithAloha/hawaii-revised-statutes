<P>&#9;(b)  No insurer shall assume or use a name deceptively similar to that of any other authorized insurer, nor which tends to deceive or mislead as to the type of organization of the insurer.</P>

If within the thirty-day period the commissioner finds the name change request does not meet the requirements of this chapter or of the corporation laws of this State, the commissioner shall send to the insurer written notice of disapproval of the request specifying in what respect the proposed name change fails to meet the requirements of this chapter or the corporation laws of this State and stating that the name change shall not become effective.
