<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§431:15-402  Liquidation of property of foreign or alien insurers found in this State.</B>  (a)  If no domiciliary receiver has been appointed, the commissioner may apply to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit by verified petition for an order directing the commissioner to liquidate the assets found in this State of a foreign insurer, or an alien insurer not domiciled in this State, on any of the following grounds:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Any of the grounds in section 431:15-301 or section 431:15-306; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Any of the grounds specified in section 431:15-401(a)(2) through (a)(4).</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  When an order is sought under subsection (a), the court may require an appropriate notice to the insurer and hearing.  If it appears to the court that the best interests of creditors, policyholders, and the public so require, the court may issue an order to liquidate the insurer in whatever terms it considers appropriate.  The filing or recording of the order with the bureau of conveyances imparts the same notice as an evidence of title.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If a domiciliary liquidator is appointed in a reciprocal state while a liquidation is proceeding under this section, the liquidator under this section shall thereafter act as ancillary receiver under section 431:15-404.  If a domiciliary liquidator is appointed in a nonreciprocal state while a liquidation is proceeding under this section, the liquidator under this section may petition the court for permission to act as ancillary receiver under section 431:15-404.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  On the same grounds as specified in subsection (a), the commissioner may petition any appropriate federal district court to be appointed receiver to liquidate that portion of the insurer's assets and business over which the court will exercise jurisdiction, or any lesser part thereof that the commissioner deems desirable for the protection of the policyholders and creditors in this State.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The court may order the commissioner, when the commissioner has liquidated assets of a foreign or alien insurer under this section, to pay claims of residents of this State against the insurer under such rules as to the liquidation of insurers under this article as are otherwise compatible with the provisions of this section.
