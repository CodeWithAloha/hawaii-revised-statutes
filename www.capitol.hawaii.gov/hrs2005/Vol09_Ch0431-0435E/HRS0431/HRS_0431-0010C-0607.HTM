Failure to comply with this article, rules, orders, or directives of the commissioner, or to pay any lawful fee or assessment is cause for revocation.  Upon a revocation, the owner of any self-insured motor vehicle shall not operate or permit operation of the vehicle in the State until the owner has obtained insurance or has received a new certificate of self-insurance from the commissioner.
