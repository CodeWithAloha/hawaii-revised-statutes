<P>&#9;(b)  Every insurer shall report annually by June 30 the ten per cent of its producers with the greatest percentages of lapses and replacements as measured in subsection (a).</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Reported replacement and lapse rates do not alone constitute a violation of insurance laws or necessarily imply wrongdoing.  The reports are for the purpose of reviewing more closely producer activities regarding the sale of long-term care insurance.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Every insurer shall report annually by June 30 the number of lapsed policies as a per cent of its total annual sales and as a per cent of its total number of policies in force as of the end of the preceding calendar year.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Every insurer shall report annually by June 30 the number of replacement policies sold as a per cent of its total annual sales and as a per cent of its total number of policies in force as of the end of the preceding calendar year.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  For purposes of this section, "policy" means only long-term care insurance and "report" means on a statewide basis. [L 1999, c 93, pt of §2; am L 2001, c 216, §22]</P>
