<P>&#9;(b)  The commissioner shall execute the commissioner's duties and shall enforce this code.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The commissioner may:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Make reasonable rules for effectuating any provision of this code, except those relating to the commissioner's appointment, qualifications, or compensation.  The commissioner shall adopt rules to effectuate article 10C of chapter 431, subject to the approval of the governor's office and the requirements of chapter 91;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Conduct examinations and investigations to determine whether any person has violated any provision of this code or to secure information useful in the lawful administration of any provision; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Require, upon reasonable notice, that insurers report any claims information the commissioner may deem necessary to protect the public interest. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 1998, c 275, §12; am L 2003, c 212, §15]</P>

</B>
<P>  The division will be responsible for enforcement of health insurance provisions of the reciprocal beneficiaries act [L 1997, c 383], because those provisions are placed within the insurance code and, therefore, are within the commissioner's enforcement responsibility under subsection (b); those provisions can only be enforced against insurers, not employers.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-10.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Commissioner's rulemaking authority enabled commissioner to adopt procedural mechanism, i.e., peer review process, through which guidelines for service provider fees and frequency of treatment may be exceeded.  927 F. Supp. 1330.</P>
