<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§431:10C-213  Arbitration.</B>  (a)  A claimant, insurer, or provider of services may submit any dispute relating to a motor vehicle insurance policy to an arbitrator by filing a written request with the clerk of the circuit court in the circuit where the accident occurred.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The administrative judge of each circuit court shall maintain a current list of persons qualified and willing to act as arbitrators and shall, within ten days of the date of filing of a request for arbitration, appoint an arbitrator from such list to hear and determine the claim.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitration shall be in accordance with and governed by the provisions of chapter 658A.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Any fee or cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties unless otherwise allocated by the arbitrator.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  An appeal may be taken from any judgment of the arbitrator to the circuit court in the manner provided for in rule 72 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2; am L 1992, c 124, §8; am L 1997, c 251, §36; am L 2001, c 265, §4]</P>

</B>
<P>  Hawaii's public policy strongly favors arbitration when dispute centers on automobile insurance policy.  769 F. Supp. 1135.</P>
<P>  The first party to choose a forum for resolution of no-fault dispute binds the other party to that forum unless the circuit court finds that the parties have entered into a mandatory and binding arbitration agreement.  86 H. 59, 947 P.2d 371.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff and defendant's insurer did not have a written agreement in compliance with §658-1, this section did not by itself provide independent authority to compel arbitration.  86 H. 59, 947 P.2d 371.</P>
