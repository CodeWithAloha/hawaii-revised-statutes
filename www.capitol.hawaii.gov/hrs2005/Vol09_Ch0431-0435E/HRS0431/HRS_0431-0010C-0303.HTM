</B>
<P>  Injury and subsequent death of automobile passenger shot by person who walked up to stopped vehicle did not arise out of use of motor vehicle.  776 F. Supp. 1432.</P>
<P>  Right to no-fault benefits is not absolute.  73 H. 552, 836 P.2d 1074.</P>
<P>  As motorcycles are excluded from the definition of "motor vehicle" under §431:10C-103, appellant's accident with a motorcycle was not a "motor vehicle accident" under the definition set forth in §431:10C-103; appellant was thus not entitled to no-fault benefits under subsection (a) (1993).  91 H. 299 (App.), 983 P.2d 200.</P>
