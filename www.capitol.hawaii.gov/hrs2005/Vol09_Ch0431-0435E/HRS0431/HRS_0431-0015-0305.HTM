<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§431:15-305  Termination of rehabilitation.</B>  (a)  Whenever the commissioner believes further attempts to rehabilitate an insurer would substantially increase the risk of loss to creditors, policyholders or the public, or would be futile, the commissioner may petition the circuit court of the first judicial circuit for an order of liquidation.  A petition under this subsection shall have the same effect as a petition under section 431:15-306.  The court shall permit the directors of the insurer to take such actions as are reasonably necessary to defend against the petition and may order payment from the estate of the insurer of such costs and other expenses of defense as justice may require.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The rehabilitator may at any time petition the court for an order terminating rehabilitation of an insurer.  The court shall also permit the directors of the insurer to petition the court for an order terminating rehabilitation of the insurer, and may order payment from the estate of the insurer of such costs and other expenses of such petition as justice may require.  If the court finds that rehabilitation has been accomplished and that grounds for rehabilitation under section 431:15-301 no longer exist, it shall order that the insurer be restored to possession of its property and the control of its business.  The court may also make that finding and issue that order at any time upon its own motion. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</P>
