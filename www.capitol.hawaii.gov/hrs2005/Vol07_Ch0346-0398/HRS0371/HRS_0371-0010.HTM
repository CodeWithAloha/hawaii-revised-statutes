In pursuance of this duty, the governor or the governor's designated agent may appoint temporary boards of mediation, consisting of one or more members, provide necessary expenses of such boards, order reasonable compensation not exceeding $10 a day for each member engaged in such mediation, prescribe rules of procedure for such boards, conduct investigations and hearings, and may do all things convenient and necessary to accomplish the purposes of this paragraph.  The governor or the governor's designated agent may designate the director of labor and industrial relations to act as mediator.</P>
<P>&#9;Whenever a controversy arises between an employer and the employer's employees which is not settled either in conference between the representatives of the parties or through mediation in the manner provided in this section, the controversy may by agreement of the parties be submitted to arbitration by three persons, one to be selected by the employer, one to be selected by the employees and the two so selected to select the third.</P>
<P>&#9;Whenever the governor finds that all reasonable efforts for mediation have been made and failed and that the parties are unable or refuse to enter into an agreement for arbitration, the governor may appoint an emergency board of disinterested persons to investigate and report respecting the controversy.  The board shall be composed of such number of persons as the governor may deem desirable.  The compensation of the members of the board shall be fixed by the governor, which compensation, together with all necessary traveling and other expenses, shall be provided by the director out of funds made available to the department of labor and industrial relations.  The board shall be created separately in each instance and it shall investigate promptly the facts as to the controversy and report thereon, together with its recommendations, to the governor with all reasonable dispatch and in any event not later than thirty days from the date of its creation.
