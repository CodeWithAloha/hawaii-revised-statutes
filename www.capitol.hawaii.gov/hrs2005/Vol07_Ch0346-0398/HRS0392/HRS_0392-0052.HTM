Upon locating the employee, the director shall pay from the special fund to the employee an amount equal to but not more than the amount paid into the fund by the employer.  If the employee cannot be located for a period of two years from the date of deposit, the employee's unpaid benefits shall escheat to the special fund for disability benefits.
