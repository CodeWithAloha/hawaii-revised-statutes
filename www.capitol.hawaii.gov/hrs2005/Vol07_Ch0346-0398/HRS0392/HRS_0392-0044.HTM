<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§392-44  Payment of disability benefits.</B>  Benefits provided under this chapter shall be paid periodically and promptly and, except as to a contested period of disability, without any decision by the director.  The first payment of benefits shall be paid within ten days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the filing of required proof of claim.  Thereafter, benefits shall be due and payable every two weeks.  The director may determine that benefits may be paid monthly or semi-monthly if wages were so paid, and may authorize deviation from the foregoing requirements to facilitate prompt payment of benefits.  If an employer or insurer fails to make the first payment of benefits within ten days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the filing of required proof of claim, the director shall, unless good cause can be shown, require the employer or insurer to pay such benefits plus an additional ten per cent of the benefits due and payable to the employee. [L 1969, c 148, pt of §1; am L 1971, c 109, §1(g)]</P>
