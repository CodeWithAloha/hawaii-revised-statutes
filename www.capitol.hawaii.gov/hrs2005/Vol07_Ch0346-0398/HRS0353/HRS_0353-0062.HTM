</B>
<P>  Neither chapter 706 nor chapter 353 prohibits the Hawaii paroling authority from setting a prisoner's minimum term at a period equal to his or her maximum sentence.  97 H. 183, 35 P.3d 210.</P>
<P>  As no Hawaii statute governing parole requires a parolee’s parole to be automatically revoked upon the parolee’s conviction and sentence to imprisonment for a crime committed while on parole, and this section appears to vest Hawaii paroling authority with discretion to revoke parole, parolee’s due process right violated when authority summarily revoked parole without giving parolee a final revocation hearing.  88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162.</P>
