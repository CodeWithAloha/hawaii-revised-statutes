<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The employee, or a person acting on behalf of the employee, reports or is about to report to the employer, or reports or is about to report to a public body, verbally or in writing, a violation or a suspected violation of:</P><DIR>

</B>
<P>  Employee's wrongful termination action under Hawaii whistleblower's act preempted by ERISA whistleblower provision.  999 F.2d 408.</P>
<P>  Because plaintiff did not have full and fair opportunity to litigate claims sounding in wrongful discharge in plaintiff’s unemployment compensation benefits proceeding, the court refused to apply either issue preclusion or claim preclusion.  866 F. Supp. 459.</P>
<P>  Because §378-2 and this section did not contain limitation periods, court invoked State’s general personal injury statute of limitations, §657-7; plaintiff’s state law claims barred where neither the collective bargaining proceedings nor the equal employment opportunity commission proceedings tolled the statute of limitations.   874 F. Supp. 1095.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff's state whistleblower claim under this section barred, where plaintiff did not file complaint until well after the ninety-day period after the most recent alleged violation of the whistleblowers' protection act.  75 F. Supp. 2d 1113.</P>
