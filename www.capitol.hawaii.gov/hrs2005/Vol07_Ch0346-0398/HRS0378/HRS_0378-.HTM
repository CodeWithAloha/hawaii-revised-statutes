</B>
<P>  Does not bar common law remedies; exclusive remedy for constructive discharge claim based on sexual harassment.  634 F. Supp. 684.</P>
<P>  If plaintiff was alleging public policy wrongful discharge claim based on Parnar v. Americana Hotels, Inc., and §378</P>
<P>32(2), plaintiff's claim was barred, since this chapter provided sufficient remedy for its violation.  938 F. Supp. 1503.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff's resort to a possible common law action of violation of public policy barred, where plaintiff was making claims of retaliation through wrongful denial of promotion based upon § [sic] 378; that type of claim was analogous to a wrongful discharge claim and § [sic] 378 provided a sufficient remedy for retaliation. 75 F. Supp. 2d 1113.</P>
<P>  Defendant's countermotion for partial summary judgment denied as to claim premised under this chapter of the Hawaii Discriminatory Employment Practices Act [sic] (HDEPA), where defendant could be held individually liable under the HDEPA barring application of other defenses.  112 F. Supp. 2d 1041.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff did not have to obtain a right to sue letter from Hawaii civil rights commission to bring plaintiff's chapter 378 claims for sexual harassment.  159 F. Supp. 2d 1211.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff failed to properly state a claim for relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act or this chapter, where plaintiff argued that reference to general "statutory civil rights" in the title of the second count of the complaint was sufficient. 284 F. Supp. 2d 1261.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff asserted discrimination claims against plaintiff's supervisor and employer, and the alleged parent company of the employer, pursuant to this chapter and federal law. Defendants' motion for partial dismissal or alternatively, for partial summary judgment granted in part (e.g., claims based on national origin and aiding and abetting) and denied in part (e.g., claims based on color).  322 F. Supp. 2d 1101.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff asserted viable claims against defendants under 42 U.S.C. §1981, Title VII, and this chapter, and each of the statutes provided a sufficient remedy such that the court did not need to fashion any further remedy under the public policy exception, defendants' motion for partial summary judgment granted on plaintiff's claim for violation of public policy.  322 F. Supp. 2d 1101.</P>
