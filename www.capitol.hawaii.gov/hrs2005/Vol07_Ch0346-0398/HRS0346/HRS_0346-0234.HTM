The court shall appoint counsel for the dependent adult at any time where it finds that the dependent adult requires a separate legal advocate and is unable to afford private counsel.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The court may order reasonable costs and fees of the guardian ad litem to be paid by the party for whom the guardian ad litem is appointed, if that party has sufficient financial resources to pay such costs and fees.  The court may also order the appropriate parties to pay or reimburse reasonable costs and fees of the guardian ad litem and counsel appointed for the dependent adult. [L 1989, c 381, pt of §1; am L 1990, c 144, §1 and c 234, §9]</P>
