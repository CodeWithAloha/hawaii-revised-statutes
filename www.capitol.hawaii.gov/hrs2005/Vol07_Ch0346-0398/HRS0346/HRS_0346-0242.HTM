<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§346-242  Review hearings.  </B>Except for good cause shown, the court shall set each case for a review hearing not later than six months after the date that a protective order and protective services plan are ordered by the court.  Thereafter, the court shall review the matter at intervals of not longer than six months until the court's jurisdiction has been terminated.  The department and the guardian ad litem, if any, shall submit a written report, with copies to the parties or their counsel, at least fifteen days prior to the date set for each review.  The report shall evaluate whether the parties have complied with the terms and conditions of the protective order and protective services plan; shall recommend any modification to the order or plan; and shall recommend whether the court shall retain jurisdiction or terminate the case.  At each review, the court shall determine whether the parties have complied with the terms and conditions of the order and plan; enforce such sanctions for noncompliance as may be appropriate; and order such revisions to the existing order or plan as are in the best interests of the dependent adult.  At each review, the court shall make an express finding as to whether it shall retain jurisdiction or terminate the case, and, in each instance, shall state the basis for its action.
