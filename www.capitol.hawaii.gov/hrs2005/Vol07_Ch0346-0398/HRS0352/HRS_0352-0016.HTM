<P>&#9;(b)  Under such a work release plan, any such person may be authorized to secure or continue in suitable employment outside of such youth correctional facility, and unless otherwise authorized by the department with respect to specific cases, return to and remain in such facility during non-working hours.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Employment under such a work release plan may be at a wage less than the minimum wage authorized in chapter 387; provided that no more than five hours of a person's work week shall be paid at wages less than the minimum wage.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  It shall be the duty of the employer of a person participating in a work release plan to transmit to the director the earnings of such persons.
