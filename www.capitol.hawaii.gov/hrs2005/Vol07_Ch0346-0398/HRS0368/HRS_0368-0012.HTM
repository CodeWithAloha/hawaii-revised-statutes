<P>  Plaintiff's claims not time-barred, where defendant argued that certain claims were time-barred because plaintiff failed to serve defendant with complaint within ninety days of receipt of right to sue letters and that plaintiff had no intent to serve defendant with original complaint; among other things, plaintiff filed complaint within ninety days of receipt of right to sue letters and plaintiff was not also required to serve defendant within ninety-day period, plaintiff was only required to commence the civil action by filing complaint.  75 F.
