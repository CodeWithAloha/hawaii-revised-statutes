<P>&#9;(b)  The pharmacist shall not substitute an equivalent generic drug product if the practitioner indicates "brand medically necessary" or words of similar meaning on the prescription.  The designation "brand medically necessary" or other similar words or phrases must be handwritten by the practitioner and shall not be preprinted or stamped on the written prescription.  The pharmacist shall not substitute an equivalent generic drug product if a prescription is orally or electronically ordered and the practitioner or authorized employee of the practitioner indicates "brand medically necessary" or other similar words or phrases.</P>
<P>&#9;The pharmacist shall note the practitioner's instructions on the prescription record required to be maintained under section 328-17.7.</P>

<P>&#9;(c)  The pharmacist shall not substitute an equivalent generic drug product for any prescription for an anti-epileptic drug, except upon the consent of the practitioner and the patient or the patient's parent or guardian.  This narrow exception for epileptic patients shall not be construed as a policy decision to make exceptions for any other conditions.</P>
