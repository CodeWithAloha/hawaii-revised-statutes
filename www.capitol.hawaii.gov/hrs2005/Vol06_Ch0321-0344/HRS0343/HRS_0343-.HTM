</B>
<P>  Environmental impact statement addressed all statutory requirements of chapter, was compiled in good faith, and set forth sufficient information to enable decisionmaker to consider fully the environmental factors involved.  81 H. 171, 914 P.2d 1364.</P>
<P>  Chapter does not conflict with Hawaiian homes commission act, has only incidental impact on Hawaiian home lands, and is not inconsistent with interests of the beneficiaries; thus, chapter applies to Hawaiian home lands.  87 H. 91, 952 P.2d 379.</P>
<P>  HHCA §204 not violated by application of this chapter.  87 H. 91, 952 P.2d 379.</P>
<P>  Where lease was executed in contravention of this chapter, power plant developers were not "existing Hawaiian homes commission act lessees"; trial court's decision that the lease was void did not deprive developers of any interest they were entitled to under the law.  106 H. 270, 103 P.3d 939.</P>
