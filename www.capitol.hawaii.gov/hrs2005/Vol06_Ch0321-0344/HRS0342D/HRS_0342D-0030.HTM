Each day of each violation shall constitute a separate offense.  Any action taken in court to impose or collect the penalty provided for in this section shall be considered a civil action.  In determining the amount of a civil penalty the court shall consider the seriousness of the violation or violations, the economic benefit, if any, resulting from the violation, any history of these violations, any good-faith efforts to comply with the applicable requirements, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and any other matters that justice may require.  It shall be presumed that the violator’s economic and financial conditions allow payment of the penalty, and the burden of proof of the contrary is on the violator.</P>
