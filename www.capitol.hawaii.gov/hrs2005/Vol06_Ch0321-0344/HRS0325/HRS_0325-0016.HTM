Any person in this State whose body fluids or tissue are subject to a test for the presence of HIV infection shall be afforded the opportunity to receive HIV counseling by the party ordering or requesting that the test be performed and shall be afforded the opportunity to obtain the test results.  The counseling provided shall be consistent with guidelines established by the department.  The opportunity to receive counseling shall be afforded both prior to obtaining a sample for HIV testing and upon disclosure of the test results, regardless of the serostatus of the individual tested, except that testing conducted pursuant to subsection (b)(1) and (2) shall be exempted from the counseling requirements of this subsection.</P>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The department, laboratories and research facilities, health care providers, blood banks, plasma centers, and educational institutions may subject any body fluids or tissue to be used in research to a test for HIV infection if the test is performed in a manner by which the identity of the test subject is not known and may not be retrieved by the researcher;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Anonymous testing carried out at HIV test sites established by the department; provided that informed oral consent is obtained;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Testing of body fluids or tissue ordered by a third party, so long as that third party, including but not limited to an insurance company, employer, or school, obtains the informed written consent of the person to be tested authorizing the release of the test results to the third party, and transmits a signed copy of the written informed consent to the health provider prior to any release of the requested test results to the third party;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Informed consent is not required where the patient is unable to give consent and it is determined by the patient's treating physician that the patient's HIV status is necessary to make a diagnosis or determine an appropriate course of treatment for the patient.  The patient shall be informed in a timely manner that a test for the presence of HIV has been performed pursuant to this paragraph, and the patient shall be provided the opportunity to obtain the test results and appropriate counseling;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;A treating physician may order an HIV test without the patient's informed consent if the physician has determined that the patient is incapable of giving consent prior to the rendering of treatment and when there is reason to believe that the safety of a health care worker may be affected due to exposure to the blood or bodily fluids of a patient suspected of possible HIV infection.  The availability and quality of health care services shall not be compromised based on the findings and testing performed pursuant to this paragraph.  The costs of any testing performed shall be borne by the health care provider and may not be claimed against the patient or the patient's health care insurer.
