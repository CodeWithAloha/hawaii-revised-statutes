Maximum contaminant levels covered by revised National Primary Drinking Water Regulations shall be set at a level at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety.  Treatment techniques covered by revised National Primary Drinking Water Regulations shall require treatment necessary to prevent known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons.  The State Primary Drinking Water Regulations shall be not less stringent than the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations in effect at that time.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Subject to section 340E-3, State Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Regulations shall apply to each public water system in the State; however, such regulations shall not apply to a public water system which:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Obtains all of its water from, but is not owned or operated by, a public water system to which such regulations apply;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Does not sell water to any person; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Is not a carrier which conveys passengers in interstate commerce.</P></DIR>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Set standards and prohibitions controlling any underground injection if such injection may result in the presence of any contaminant in underground water which supplies or may be expected to supply any public water system, and if the presence of such contaminant may result in such system’s not complying with any national primary drinking water regulation or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Require, in the case of a program which authorizes underground injection by permit, that the applicant for the permit satisfy the director that the underground injection will meet the requirements of item (1) of this subsection.</P>
