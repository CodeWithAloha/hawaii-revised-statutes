Even if the principal has an advance mental health care directive, the principal has the right to make decisions regarding mental health care or mental health treatment, so long as the principal has capacity. </P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The fact that a principal has executed an advance mental health care directive shall not create a presumption, nor constitute evidence or an indication, that the principal is mentally incompetent or lacks capacity.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  This chapter shall not create a presumption concerning the intention of an individual who has not executed or who has revoked an advance mental health care directive or power of attorney.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  For the purposes of this chapter, the determination that a principal lacks capacity shall be made by the supervising health care provider who is a physician and one other physician or licensed psychologist after both have conducted an examination of the principal.  Upon examination and a joint determination that the principal lacks capacity, the supervising health care provider shall promptly note the determination in the principal's medical record, including the facts and professional opinions that form the basis of the determination, and shall promptly notify the agent that the principal lacks capacity and that the advance mental health care directive has been invoked.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The determination that a principal has recovered capacity shall be made by the supervising health care provider who is a physician.  The supervising health care provider shall promptly note the recovery of capacity in the principal's medical record, and shall promptly notify the agent that the principal has recovered capacity.
