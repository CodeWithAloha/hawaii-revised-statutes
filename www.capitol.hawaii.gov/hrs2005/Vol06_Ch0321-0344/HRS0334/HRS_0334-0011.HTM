Each board shall consist of nine members appointed by the governor, who shall serve for terms to be determined by the governor.  After the initial appointees, the governor shall fill each vacancy on a board by appointing a member from a list of four persons submitted by that board, except that, if the board is unable to achieve a quorum at two consecutive meetings called for the purpose of making such a list, the list may be provided by a group of at least seven service area consumers and nonproviders of mental health services.  This group shall consist of all board members willing to participate in making the list and other area consumers and nonproviders of mental health services to be selected by the service area board chairperson and service area administrator.  Any meeting called for the purpose of making the list shall be subject to part I of chapter 92.  The members of the board shall be service area residents, who are consumers or nonproviders of mental health services and service area providers with a majority being non-state employees and nonproviders of mental health or other health services.</P>
