<P>  In light of the definition of "dangerous to self" under §334-1, person's refusal to take medications and person's racist remarks to strangers constituted insufficient evidence to support family court's finding that person was imminently and substantially dangerous to person's self.  102 H. 528 (App.), 78 P.3d 341.</P>
