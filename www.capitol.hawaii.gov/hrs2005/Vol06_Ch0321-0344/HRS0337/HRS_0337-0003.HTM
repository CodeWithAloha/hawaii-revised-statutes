If no such agent appears within thirty days from the time of the apprehension, the fugitive may be discharged.  All costs and expenses incurred in the apprehending, securing, maintaining, and transmitting the fugitive to the state making the demand shall be paid by such state.  Any agent so appointed who receives the fugitive into the agent’s custody shall be empowered to transmit the fugitive to the state from which the fugitive has fled.  The executive authority of the State is vested with the power, on the application of any person interested, to demand the return to the State of any fugitive within the purview of this chapter.
