<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The installation or operation of an underground storage tank or tank system occurring or proposed to occur by the granting of the variance does not present a greater danger to human health or the environment than the installation or operation of what would have been allowed by the federal rules established under Subtitle I of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as added by the federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, 42 U.S.C. §§6991-6991i;</P>
