The order shall fix a place and time, not later than twenty-four hours thereafter, for a hearing to be held before the director.  The governor or the director may also institute a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction to secure such relief as may be necessary to abate the danger or threat.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any power which the governor or any other officer may have to declare an emergency and act on the basis of such declaration, if such power is conferred by statute or constitutional provision, or inheres in the office.
