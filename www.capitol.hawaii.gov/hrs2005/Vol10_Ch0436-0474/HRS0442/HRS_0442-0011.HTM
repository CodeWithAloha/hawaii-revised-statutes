<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§442-11  Biennial renewal; fees; failure to renew.</B>  Every person holding a license to practice chiropractic in the State shall submit a renewal application with the board of chiropractic examiners on or before December 31 of each odd-numbered year and shall pay a renewal fee.  If the board has established continuing education requirements for renewal, the license shall not be renewed unless proof of compliance with the requirements is submitted.  A renewal notice shall be mailed to the last known address of all licensed chiropractors on or before November 30 of each odd-numbered year.</P>
<P>&#9;The failure, neglect, or refusal of any person holding a license to practice chiropractic to renew the license or to pay the renewal fee, after thirty days of delinquency, constitutes a forfeiture of the license; provided that the license shall be restored upon written application therefor together with proof of compliance with the continuing education requirements, if any, and a payment of all delinquent fees and a penalty fee, if the application and payments are made within a period of one year from the date of the inception of the forfeiture.  In the event, however, the forfeiture is permitted to continue over a period of one year, in addition to the foregoing requirements, the person may be required to submit to reexamination and successfully pass the reexamination.
