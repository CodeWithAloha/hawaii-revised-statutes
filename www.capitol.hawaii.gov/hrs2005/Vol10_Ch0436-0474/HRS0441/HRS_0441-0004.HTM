Each county may enact ordinances dealing separately with the development of cemeteries.  No cemetery shall hereafter be established, nor shall the boundaries of any existing cemetery be extended, without the location and boundaries of the cemetery or extension thereof having first been approved by the council of the county in which the cemetery is located.  The approval may be endorsed in writing by authority of the council, upon the certificate of dedication referred to in section 441-2, and the registrar of conveyances or the assistant registrar of the land court, shall not accept for filing any certificate of dedication without such endorsement or, in lieu thereof, a certified copy of a resolution of the council approving the location and boundaries of the cemetery or extension thereof which resolution shall be recorded.
