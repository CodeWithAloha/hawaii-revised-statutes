The registration statement shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount of $250, or in the amount and with any additional sums as may be prescribed by the attorney general.  The statement shall list the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all officers, agents, servants, employees, directors, and independent contractors of a professional fundraising counsel, and the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all officers, agents, servants, employees, directors, and independent contractors of a professional solicitor.  Renewal statements shall be filed with the department on or before July 1 of each calendar year in which the professional fundraising counsel or professional solicitor does business in or from the State and shall be effective until June 30 of the next calendar year.  The renewal statement shall be in a form prescribed by the attorney general.  A renewal fee of $250, or in any amount and with any additional sums as may be prescribed by the attorney general, shall accompany the renewal statement.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The professional fundraising counsel or professional solicitor, at the time of each filing, shall file with and have approved by the attorney general a bond in which the applicant is the principal obligor in the penal sum of $25,000 issued with good and sufficient surety or sureties approved by the attorney general and which shall remain in effect for one year.  The bond shall inure to the benefit of the State, conditioned that the applicant, its officers, directors, employees, agents, servants, and independent contractors shall not violate this chapter.
