<P>&#9;(b)  Such bond shall be for the exclusive benefit of, and be limited to, an owner or lessee of a private residence, including a condominium or cooperative unit, who has contracted with a duly licensed contractor for the construction of a roof covering to the owner's or lessee's own private residence and who has filed an appropriate claim for the replacement value of a roof covering which has become faulty or defective within the stated guarantee period.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The surety bond shall be continuous in form and the total aggregate liability of the surety for all claims shall be limited to the face amount of the bond irrespective of the number of years the bond is in force.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Any claim or subsequent action to make a claim against the bond shall be brought not later than one year after the expiration of the guarantee period for which the bond has been provided.  Claims against the bond, as provided in this section, shall not in any way supersede or prevent claims made under section 444-26 or any other appropriate statute or law.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Every contractor licensed to perform under this chapter shall, prior to entering into a contract covered by this section, provide to the owner appropriate information to evidence the existence of the bond and its conditions in writing.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Bonds required under this section shall be in addition to any other bond required by this chapter or any other bond required or executed between a contractor and an owner or other contracting agency.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  Any violation by any contractor of any provision of this section or failure to maintain in full force and effect any bond required by this section, shall be deemed to be an unfair and deceptive act or practice. [L 1980, c 289, §1; gen ch 1985]</P>
