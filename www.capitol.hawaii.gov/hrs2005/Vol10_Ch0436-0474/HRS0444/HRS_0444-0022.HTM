</B>
<P>  Defendant's motion to dismiss denied; because it was feasible that plaintiff's actions constituted that of a "professional engineer acting solely in [its] professional capacity", it was not apparent that [this chapter] barred plaintiff from bringing lawsuit.  216 F. Supp. 2d 1133.</P>
<P>  Action to recover under this section not barred when circumstances take matter outside applicability of this chapter.  58 H. 257, 567 P.2d 824.</P>
<P>  Applicable even if party has knowledge that contractor has no license.  71 H. 175, 785 P.2d 1325.</P>
<P>  Section permits a contractor, who performs both licensed and unlicensed work, to bring an action to recover payment for the licensed portion of the work.  86 H. 137 (App.), 948 P.2d 558.</P>
<P>  A contract with an unlicensed contractor is not void ab initio and this section does not bar a member of the public, who is a party to such contract, from bringing suit to recover breach of contract damages from an unlicensed contractor.  92 H. 117 (App.), 987 P.2d 1015.</P>
