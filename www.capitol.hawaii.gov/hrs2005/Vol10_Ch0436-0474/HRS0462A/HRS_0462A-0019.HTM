<P>&#9;This section provides minimum pilotage requirements, and is not intended to negate the department of transportation's responsibility for the safety of all ports and shore waters in the State, nor does it limit the department's right to require additional pilotage should that department determine it is necessary to ensure safety in the ports or shore waters of the State.
