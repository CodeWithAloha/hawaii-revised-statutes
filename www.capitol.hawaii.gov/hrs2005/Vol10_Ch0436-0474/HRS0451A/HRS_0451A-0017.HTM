<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§451A-17</B>  <B>Injunctive relief.</B>  The director may apply for an injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any person who has not been issued a license or whose license has been suspended or revoked or has expired from practicing in the dealing and fitting of hearing aids; and, upon the filing of a verified petition in the court, the court or any judge thereof, if satisfied by affidavit or otherwise, may issue a temporary injunction, without notice or bond, enjoining the defendant from further practicing in the dealing and fitting of hearing aids.  A copy of the verified complaint shall be served upon the defendant and the proceedings shall thereafter be conducted as in other civil cases.  If it is established that the defendant has been or is practicing dealing and fitting of hearing aids without having been issued a license or after the license has been suspended or revoked or has expired, the court or any judge thereof may enter a decree enjoining the defendant from further practicing in the dealing and fitting of hearing aids.  In case of violation of any injunction issued under this section, the court may summarily try and punish the offender for contempt of court.  The injunction proceeding shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of all penalties and other remedies provided in this chapter. [L 1969, c 205, pt of §1; am L 1997, c 88, §12]</P>
