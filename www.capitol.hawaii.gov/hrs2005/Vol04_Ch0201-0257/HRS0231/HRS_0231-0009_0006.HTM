The fiduciary shall be liable for the payment of those taxes up to the amount of the available property held by the fiduciary, but shall not be personally liable.  The fiduciary may retain so much property as may be necessary to pay the taxes due.  The fiduciary may recover the amount of taxes paid from the beneficiary to whom the property shall have been distributed. [L 1989, c 14, §1(3)]</P>
