<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A model 2 seller, who shall be a seller who selects a certified automated system to use which calculates the amount of tax due on a transaction; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A model 3 seller, who shall be a seller who uses its own proprietary automated sales tax system that has been certified as a certified automated system.</P></DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  A model 2 seller shall be allowed a monetary allowance that the director shall prescribe in accordance with the terms agreed to by the member states of the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.

<P>&#9;(d)  A model 3 seller and all other sellers that are not under model 1 or model&nbsp;2 shall be allowed a monetary allowance that the director shall prescribe in accordance with the terms agreed to by the member states of the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.

<P>&#9;(f)  No person required to collect any tax imposed by chapter 237 or 238, or any tax authorized to be collected under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement shall be held liable for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales or use tax by reason of reliance on erroneous data provided by the director with respect to tax rates, boundaries, or taxing jurisdiction assignments.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  In connection with a purchaser's request from a seller of over-collected sales or use taxes, a seller shall be presumed to have a reasonable business practice, if in the collection of the sales or use taxes, the seller:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Uses either a provider or a system, including a proprietary system, that is certified by the State; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Has remitted to the State all taxes collected less any deductions, credits, or collection allowances.</P></DIR>
