<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The lease is to serve as the functional equivalent of an extension of credit to the lessee of the property;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The property to be leased is acquired specifically for the leasing transaction under consideration, or was acquired specifically for an earlier leasing transaction;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Provide for the maintenance, repair, replacement, or servicing of the leased property during the lease term;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Purchase parts and accessories in bulk or for an individual property after the lessee has taken delivery of the property; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;Purchase insurance for the lessee;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;At the inception of the lease the effect of the transaction will yield a return that will compensate the lessor financial institution for not less than the lessor's full investment in the property plus the estimated total cost of financing the property over the term of the lease, from:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Rentals;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;The estimated residual value of the property at the expiration of the initial term of the lease;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The maximum lease term during which the lessor financial institution must recover the lessor's full investment in the property, plus the estimated total cost of financing the property, shall be forty years; and</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;At the expiration of the lease (including any renewals or extensions with the same lessee), all interest in the property shall be either liquidated or leased again on a nonoperating basis as soon as practicable (in no event later than two years from the expiration of the lease), but in no case shall the lessor retain any interest in the property beyond fifty years after the lessor's acquisition of the property.
