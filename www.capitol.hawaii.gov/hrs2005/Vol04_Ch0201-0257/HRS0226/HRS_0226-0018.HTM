<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Dependable, efficient, and economical statewide energy systems capable of supporting the needs of the people;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Increased energy self-sufficiency where the ratio of indigenous to imported energy use is increased;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Greater energy security in the face of threats to Hawaii's energy supplies and systems; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply and use.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  To achieve the energy objectives, it shall be the policy of this State to ensure the provision of adequate, reasonably priced, and dependable energy services to accommodate demand.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  To further achieve the energy objectives, it shall be the policy of this State to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Support research and development as well as promote the use of renewable energy sources;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Ensure that the combination of energy supplies and energy-saving systems is sufficient to support the demands of growth;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Base decisions of least-cost supply-side and demand-side energy resource options on a comparison of their total costs and benefits when a least-cost is determined by a reasonably comprehensive, quantitative, and qualitative accounting of their long-term, direct and indirect economic, environmental, social, cultural, and public health costs and benefits;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Promote all cost-effective conservation of power and fuel supplies through measures including:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Development of cost-effective demand-side management programs;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Education; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;Adoption of energy-efficient practices and technologies;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Ensure to the extent that new supply-side resources are needed, the development or expansion of energy systems utilizes the least-cost energy supply option and maximizes efficient technologies;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Support research, development, and demonstration of energy efficiency, load management, and other demand-side management programs, practices, and technologies;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Promote alternate fuels and energy efficiency by encouraging diversification of transportation modes and infrastructure;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Support actions that reduce, avoid, or sequester greenhouse gases in utility, transportation, and industrial sector applications; and</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;Support actions that reduce, avoid, or sequester Hawaii's greenhouse gas emissions through agriculture and forestry initiatives. [L 1978, c 100, pt of §2; am L 1986, c 276, §17; am L 1990, c 319, §2; am L 1994, c 96, §4; am L 2000, c 176, §1]</P>
