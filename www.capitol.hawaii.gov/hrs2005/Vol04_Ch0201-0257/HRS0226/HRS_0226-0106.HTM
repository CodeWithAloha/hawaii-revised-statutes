<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Seek to use marginal or nonessential agricultural land and public land to meet housing needs of low- and moderate-income and gap-group households.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Encourage the use of alternative construction and development methods as a means of reducing production costs.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Improve information and analysis relative to land availability and suitability for housing.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Create incentives for development which would increase home ownership and rental opportunities for Hawaii's low- and moderate-income households, gap-group households, and residents with special needs.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Encourage continued support for government or private housing programs that provide low interest mortgages to Hawaii's people for the purchase of initial owner- occupied housing.</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Encourage public and private sector cooperation in the development of rental housing alternatives.</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Encourage improved coordination between various agencies and levels of government to deal with housing policies and regulations.</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Give higher priority to the provision of quality housing that is affordable for Hawaii's residents and less priority to development of housing intended primarily for individuals outside of Hawaii. [L 1986, c 276, §33; am L 1989, c 250, §3]</P>
