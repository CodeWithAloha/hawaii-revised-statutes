<P>&#9;<B>§249-31  State registration fee.</B>  (a)  All vehicles and motor vehicles in the State as defined in section 249-1, including antique motor vehicles, except as otherwise provided in sections 249-4 and 249-6, shall be subject to a $25 annual vehicle registration fee.  The fee shall become due and payable on January 1, and shall be paid before April 1 in each year together with all other taxes and fees levied by this chapter; provided that should any county elect to renew motor vehicle registrations on a staggered basis as authorized by section 286-51, the state registration for that county shall likewise be staggered so that the state registration fee is due and payable at the same time and shall be collected together with the county fee.  The state registration fee shall be deemed delinquent if not paid with the county registration fee.  The respective counties shall collect this fee together with the vehicle registration tax collected for the county and shall transfer the moneys collected under this section to the State.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  From each annual motor vehicle registration fee, the director shall deposit $20 into the state highway fund and $5 into the emergency medical services special fund.
