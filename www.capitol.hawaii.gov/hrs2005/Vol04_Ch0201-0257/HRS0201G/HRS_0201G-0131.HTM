<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;The defects are irreparable; or</P>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If the corporation does not opt to purchase defective real property, the corporation shall also have the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a contract to repair a dwelling unit which has a construction defect or land which has a soil defect.

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If the corporation does not execute either a contract to repurchase the real property or an agreement to repair and rent the real property within ninety days after written notice is given to the corporation of a construction defect, the owner may pursue any other available legal remedies.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  If real property developed, constructed, financed, purchased, or sold pursuant to Act 105, Session Laws of Hawaii 1970, as amended, is found to have a substantial construction or soil defect, the corporation shall have the right, but not the obligation, to file or cause to be filed a legal action on behalf of or by, the owner or lessee of the real property for the recovery of damages or for injunctive relief against the developer, co-developer, general contractor, and their subcontractors, consultants, and other parties notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in chapter 657.  Additionally, notwithstanding any provision of rule 23 of the Hawaii rules of civil procedure, the corporation may file or cause to be filed a legal action brought under this subsection as a class action on behalf of or by at least two owners or lessees of real property that have similar substantial construction or soil defects.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed so as to diminish the rights or remedies of the corporation otherwise provided under common law, by statute or by contract.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The corporation shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary for the purposes of this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  This section shall not apply to a particular real property and shall not apply after subsequent transfers of title of that real property if the corporation releases the restrictions when the real property is financed under a federally subsidized mortgage program.</P>
