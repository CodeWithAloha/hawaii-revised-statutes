The period over which the principal and interest shall be paid need not coincide with the period over which the loan from the mortgage lender for the balance of the purchase price must be repaid.  The borrower may repay the whole or any part of the unpaid balance of the downpayment loan, plus accrued interest at any time without penalty.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The corporation may secure the services of the mortgage lender who loans to the borrower the balance of the purchase price of the residential property or the services of any other mortgage lender doing business in the State to collect, on behalf of the State, the principal and interest of the downpayment loan and otherwise to service the downpayment loan, for a servicing fee not in excess of the prevailing loan servicing fees.</P>
