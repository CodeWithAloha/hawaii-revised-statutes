The department may also make loans to assist businesses located in communities near military installations to develop infrastructure to minimize the possibility of or assist in the mitigation of the adverse effects of the closure or reduction in capacity of a military installation.  The loans may be made in conjunction with loans made by other financial institutions, including the Small Business Administration.  Where the loans made by the department are secured, the security may be subordinated to the loans made by other financial institutions, when the subordination is required to obtain loans from such institutions.

For purposes of this subsection, the prime rate shall be determined on the first day of each month, and shall be the rate charged by the two largest banks in the State of Hawaii identified by the department of commerce and consumer affairs.  Should there be a difference in rate charged by the institutions, the lower of the two shall be used.
