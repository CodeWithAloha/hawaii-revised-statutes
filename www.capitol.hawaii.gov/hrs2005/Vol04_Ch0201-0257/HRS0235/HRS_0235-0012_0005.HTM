<P>provided that multiple owners of a single system shall be entitled to a single tax credit; and provided further that the tax credit shall be apportioned between the owners in proportion to their contribution to the cost of the system.</P>
<P>&#9;In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for every eligible renewable energy technology system that is installed and placed in service by the entity.  The cost upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level.  Distribution and share of credit shall be determined pursuant to section 235-110.7(a).</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  For the purposes of this section:</P>
<P>&#9;"Actual cost" means costs related to the renewable energy technology systems under subsection (a), including accessories and installation, but not including the cost of consumer incentive premiums unrelated to the operation of the system or offered with the sale of the system and costs for which another credit is claimed under this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;"Renewable energy technology system" means a new system that captures and converts a renewable source of energy, such as wind, heat (solar thermal), or light (photovoltaic) from the sun into:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A usable source of thermal or mechanical energy;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Electricity; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Fuel.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;"Solar or wind energy system" means any identifiable facility, equipment, apparatus, or the like that converts insolation or wind energy to useful thermal or electrical energy for heating, cooling, or reducing the use of other types of energy that are dependent upon fossil fuel for their generation.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The dollar amount of any new federal energy tax credit similar to the credit provided in this section that is established after June 30, 2003, and any utility rebate, shall be deducted from the cost of the qualifying system and its installation before applying the state tax credit.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The director of taxation shall prepare any forms that may be necessary to claim a tax credit under this section, including forms identifying the technology type of each tax credit claimed under this section, whether for solar thermal, photovoltaic from the sun, or wind.  The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish reasonable information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of the credit over liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted.  All claims for the tax credit under this section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</P>
