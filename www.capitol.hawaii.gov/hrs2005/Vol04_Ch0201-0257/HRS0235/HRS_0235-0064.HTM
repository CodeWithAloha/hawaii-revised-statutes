<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§235-64  Taxes withheld by employer held in trust; employer's liability.</B>  (a)  All taxes withheld by any employer under section 235-61 shall be held in trust by the employer for the State and for the payment of the same to the collector in the manner and at the time required by this chapter.  If any employer fails, neglects, or refuses to deduct and withhold from the wages paid to an employee, or to pay over, the amount of tax required, the employer shall be liable to pay to the State the amount of the tax.  An employer may recover from an employee any amount which the employer should have withheld but did not withhold from the employee's wages, if the employer has been required to pay and has paid the amount to the State out of the employer's own funds pursuant to this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  In addition to the liability imposed by subsection (a), if any employer fails, neglects, or refuses to deduct and withhold from the wages paid to any employee, or to pay over, the amount of tax required, any person excluding those who have only ministerial duties, who is under a duty to deduct and withhold or to pay over, the amount of tax required, and who wilfully fails to perform such duty, shall be liable to the State for the amount of the tax.  The liability may be assessed and collected in the same manner as the liability imposed by subsection (a); provided that two or more persons may be assessed under this subsection jointly or in the alternative, but the tax shall be collected only once with respect to the same wages.  The voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the employer, or the withdrawal and surrender of its right to engage in business within this State shall not discharge the liability hereby imposed.
