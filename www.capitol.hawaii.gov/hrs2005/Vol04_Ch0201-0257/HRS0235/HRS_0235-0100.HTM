<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§235-100  Persons in military service.</B>  The collection from any person in the military service of any tax on the income of such person, whether falling due prior to or during the person's period of military service (which term, as used in this section, shall have the same meaning as in the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended), shall be deferred for a period extending not more than six months after the termination of the person's period of military service if such person's ability to pay such tax is materially impaired by reason of such service.  No interest on any amount of tax, collection of which is deferred for any period under this section, and no penalty for nonpayment of such amount during such period, shall accrue for such period of deferment by reason of such nonpayment.  The running of any statute of limitations against the collection of such tax by distraint or otherwise shall be suspended for the period of military service of any individual the collection of whose tax is deferred under this section, and for an additional period of nine months beginning with the day following the period of military service. [L Sp 1957, c 1, pt of §2; Supp, §121-34; HRS §235-100; gen ch 1985]</P>
