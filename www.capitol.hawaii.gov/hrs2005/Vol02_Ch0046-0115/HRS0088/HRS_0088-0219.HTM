The notice of referendum required by section 218(d)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act to be given to employees shall contain or shall be accompanied by a statement, in such form and such detail as the agency or the individual designated to supervise the referendum shall deem necessary and sufficient to inform the employees of the rights which will accrue to them and their dependents and survivors, and the liabilities to which they will be subject, if their services are included under an agreement under this part.  Upon receiving evidence satisfactory to the governor that with respect to any such referendum the conditions specified in section 218(d)(3) of the Social Security Act have been met, the governor shall so certify to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
