In the event that any contract for federal assistance or any federal law or regulations applicable thereto requires any action, practice, procedure, or remedy to be undertaken by the agency in any urban renewal project that is contrary to or conflicts with any state or local law, then the federal requirements or provisions shall govern and prevail over any provision of state or local law to the contrary.  The foregoing provision shall be liberally applied and construed as to any case of conflicting federal and local requirements to the end that federal financial assistance for any urban renewal project shall not be hindered, impaired, or jeopardized.  In fulfilling its duties the agency may expend funds legally loaned, appropriated, or granted to it by any agency of the government, funds received as gifts or contributions, and funds received from the sale or use of its properties.  All moneys received by any agency shall be paid into the treasury of the county to be held in a redevelopment fund, hereby created, to the credit of the agency and shall be disbursed upon warrants of the director of finance, based upon vouchers signed by the chairperson or acting chairperson of the agency or any subordinate of the agency duly authorized by it to sign the vouchers.</P>
<P>&#9;The office of urban renewal coordinator shall submit in its budget estimates of amount required for administrative expenses and other costs of operation of the office of the urban renewal coordinator to be appropriated from the redevelopment fund; provided the amount to be appropriated for the purposes for any one year shall not exceed the sum of $200,000; and provided further that the estimates for the office of urban renewal coordinator shall have first been approved by the mayor and the council.
