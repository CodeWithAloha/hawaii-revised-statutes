<P>  An attorney "employed and paid by the county" for the benefit of a police officer, to defend the officer in a criminal case pursuant to this section and in related civil cases, in which the county has asserted claims adverse to the officer, is not per se, by virtue of such employment and payment, deemed ineffective counsel.  95 H. 9, 18 P.3d 871.</P>
<P>  Section provides officers with a constitutionally protected property interest--the right to legal representation for acting within the scope of their duty; due process thus entitles an officer to a contested case hearing under chapter 91 before the officer can be deprived of this interest.  89 H. 221 (App.), 971 P.2d 310.</P>
