<P>&#9;Upon such motion and upon payment of such estimated sum of money to the clerk of the court for the use of the persons entitled thereto, the court shall issue an order ex parte putting the State or county in possession of the real property sought to be condemned and permitting the State or county to do such work thereon as may be required for the purpose for which the taking of the property is sought.

Service of the order shall be made personally on those defendants who are in actual possession, and in other cases may be made by depositing a copy thereof in a United States post office, postage prepaid, registered mail addressed to the defendants at their last known addresses, or to their attorneys of record.
