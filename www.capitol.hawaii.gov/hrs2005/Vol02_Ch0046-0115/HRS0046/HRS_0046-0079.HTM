In the event such numbers are imprinted on any such bonds (i) no such number shall constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the particular bond upon which it is imprinted and (ii) no liability shall attach to the county, such district or any officer or agent of either thereof, including any fiscal agent, paying agent or registrar for such bonds, by reason of such numbers or any use made thereof, including any use thereof made by the county, such district, any such officer or any such agent, or by reason of inaccuracy, error or omission with respect thereto or in such use.  Unless the governing body shall otherwise direct, the director of finance in the director's discretion may require that all cost of obtaining and imprinting such numbers shall be paid by the purchaser of such bonds.  For the purposes of this section, the term "CUSIP identification numbers" means the numbering system adopted by the Committee for Uniform Security Identification Procedures formed by the Securities Industry Association.
