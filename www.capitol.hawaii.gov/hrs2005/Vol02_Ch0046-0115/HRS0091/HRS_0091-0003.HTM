</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an agency finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or morals, or to livestock and poultry health, requires adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule upon less than thirty days' notice of hearing, and states in writing its reasons for such finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon such abbreviated notice and hearing, including posting the abbreviated notice and hearing on the Internet as provided in section 91-2.6, as it finds practicable to adopt an emergency rule to be effective for a period of not longer than one hundred twenty days without renewal.</P>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The inadvertent failure to mail or the nonreceipt of requested copies of the proposed rule to be adopted, the proposed rule amendment, or the rule proposed to be repealed; or</P>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Any challenge to the validity of the adoption, amendment, or repeal of an administrative rule on the ground of noncompliance with statutory procedural requirements shall be forever barred unless the challenge is made in a proceeding or action, including an action pursuant to section 91-7, that is begun within three years after the effective date of the adoption, amendment, or repeal of the rule.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Whenever an agency seeks only to repeal one or more sections, chapters, or subchapters of the agency's rules because the rules are either null and void or unnecessary, and not adopt, amend, or compile any other rules:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The agency shall give thirty days' public notice at least once statewide of the proposed date of repeal and of:</P><DIR>
