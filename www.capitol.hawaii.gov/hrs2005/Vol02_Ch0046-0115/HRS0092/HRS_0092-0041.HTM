<P>  State agency required by section 91-3(a)(1) to publish notice of hearing must in addition comply with publication requirements of this section.  Att. Gen. Op. 73-12.</P>
<P>  This section does not require a public hearing in each county where a notice of public hearing is published.  Att. Gen. Op. 73-13.</P>
<P>  Notices must be published in a county newspaper and a newspaper with statewide circulation.  Att. Gen. Op. 89-4.</P>
<P>  For the repeal of rules, this section and §91-3 did not require individual notice to all property owners potentially affected by the change in the rules but only notice by publication, and a mailing to those persons who requested advance notice of department's rulemaking proceedings.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-4.</P>
