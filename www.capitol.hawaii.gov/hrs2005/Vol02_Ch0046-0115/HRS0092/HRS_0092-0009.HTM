<P>  This section and §92-5(a)(2) read together permit board and commission members to disclose some matters deliberated or decided in executive session, but they cannot disclose matters which would be inconsistent with §92-5(a)(2), i.e., matters affecting privacy of individuals under consideration for hire and they must maintain this confidentiality for as long as disclosure would defeat purpose of convening the executive meeting.
