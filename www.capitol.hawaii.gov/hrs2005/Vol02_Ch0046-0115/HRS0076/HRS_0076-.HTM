<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Note</P>
</B>
<P>  This chapter is based upon L 1955, c 274, §1, which completely reenacted RL 1945, chapter 2.  Chapter 2 was based upon L 1939, c 187, and was amended by L 1947, cc 110, 119; L Sp 1949, cc 4, 45; L 1951, cc 155, 262, 319; L 1953, c 212.  Source notes following each section commence as of L 1955, c 274.</P>
<P>  This chapter is revised to conform to L Sp 1959 2d, c 1, §11, which changed the state civil service administration by vesting in the state director of personnel services the administration of the state department of personnel services, including the authority to prescribe rules and regulations, and established the state civil service commission as an appellate body.</P>
<P>  The law is further revised as superseded by the provisions of the county charters.</P>
<P>  Privatization; contracting of government services with the private sector (repealed June 30, 2007).  L 2001, c 90, §2; L 2005, c 154.</P>
<P>  Workforce restructuring:  voluntary severance benefits or special retirement incentive benefit (repealed June 30, 2008).  L 2000, c 253, §§115 to 124; L 2002, c 131, §2.</P>

<P>  Because the procedure outlined in §76-2 is limited in its application to interpretations of this chapter and chapter 77, the constitutionality of any provision of the two chapters is an issue beyond the bounds of that process.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</P>
