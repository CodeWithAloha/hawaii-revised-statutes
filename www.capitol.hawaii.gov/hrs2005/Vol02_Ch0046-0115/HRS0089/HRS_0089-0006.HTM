<P>&#9;(13)&#9;Professional and scientific employees, who cannot be included in any of the other bargaining units.</P></DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Any decision to be reached by the applicable employer group shall be on the basis of simple majority, except when a bargaining unit includes county employees from more than one county.  In such case, the simple majority shall include at least one county.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  In addition to a collective bargaining agreement under subsection (d), each employer may negotiate, independently of one another, supplemental agreements that apply to their respective employees; provided that any supplemental agreement reached between the employer and the exclusive representative shall not extend beyond the term of the applicable collective bargaining agreement and shall not require ratification by employees in the bargaining unit.</P>
