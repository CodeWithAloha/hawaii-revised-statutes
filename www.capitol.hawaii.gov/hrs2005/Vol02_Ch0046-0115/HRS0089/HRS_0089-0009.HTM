<P>&#9;The employer and the exclusive representative may negotiate procedures governing the promotion and transfer of employees to positions within a bargaining unit; the suspension, demotion, discharge, or other disciplinary actions taken against employees within the bargaining unit; and the layoff of employees within the bargaining unit.  Violations of the procedures so negotiated may be subject to the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining agreement.</P>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;At the request of the exclusive representative and at times allowed under the collective bargaining agreement, the employer shall negotiate the repricing of classes within the bargaining unit.  The negotiated repricing actions that constitute cost items shall be subject to the requirements in section 89-10.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If repricing has not been negotiated under paragraph (1), the employer of each jurisdiction shall ensure establishment of procedures to periodically review, at least once in five years, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the repricing of classes within the bargaining unit.

<P>  Pursuant to this section and §304-11, board of regents may enter into a collective bargaining agreement providing for tuition exemption for faculty and staff members.  Att. Gen. Op. 74-12.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier,Courier New">
<P>  Where dates upon which plaintiffs were paid were not a "cost item" as that term is defined in §89-2, plaintiffs' contention that timing of their paychecks as it stood on June 30, 1999 was continued another two years until July 1, 2001 by Act 100, L 1999 (which, inter alia, amended this section), lacked merit.  Even if payroll lag was a cost item, the collective bargaining agreement expired on June 30, 1999; plaintiffs' rights under the collective bargaining agreement expired on that day.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.</P>
<P>  Board was empowered to make declaratory judgment regarding validity of collective bargaining agreement.  60 H. 436, 591 P.2d 113.</P>
<P>  Section does not bar arbitration of grievances over tenure and promotion.  66 H. 207, 659 P.2d 717.</P>
<P>  Does not limit board's power to order union to implement staffing of essential positions.  66 H. 461, 667 P.2d 783.</P>
<P>  Policy statement was not bargainable to the extent that it constituted compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act.  Because the Act inherently mandated implementation, appellant need not wait until appellee attempted an implementation of an apparatus to effectuate the policy; because implementation would affect bargainable topics, appellant may initiate bargaining at any time upon such topics.  79 H. 154, 900 P.2d 161.</P>
<P>  County did not violate collective bargaining statutes by refusing to bargain over effects of privatization where because privatization effort was contrary to law, it was outside scope of negotiable topics.  85 H. 61, 937 P.2d 397.</P>
<P>  Section 2 of Act 100, L 1999 violated the rights of public employees under article XIII, §2 of the Hawaii constitution by amending this section to prohibit public employers and public employees' unions from collectively bargaining over cost items for the biennium 1999 to 2001.  100 H. 138, 58 P.3d 649.</P>
<P>  Section 2 of Act 100, L 1999 (which amended subsection (a)) violated article XIII, §2 of the Hawaii constitution because it withdrew from the collective bargaining process core subjects such as wages, hours, and other conditions of employment that the voters contemplated would be part of the bargaining process when they ratified article XIII, §2.  101 H. 46, 62 P.3d 189.</P>
<P>  The general prohibition in subsection (d) against a public employer and the exclusive representative of a collective bargaining unit agreeing to a "proposal inconsistent with merit principles" is subject to this subsection's provisions allowing for, inter alia, negotiation of promotion and demotion procedures in a collective bargaining agreement and a grievance process for violation thereof; §76-1, Revised Charter of Honolulu §§6-302, 6-306, 6-308, and rules of the civil service commission §§13-2 and 13-3 do not conflict with subsection (d).  106 H. 205, 103 P.3d 365.</P>
<P>  In light of the plain language of subsection (d), labor relations board erred in concluding that the city's proposed transfer of refuse workers from one location to another was subject to collective bargaining under subsection (a).  106 H. 359, 105 P.3d 236.</P>
<P>  As subsection (d) precludes collective bargaining over classification issues and thus places them out of the reach of an arbitrator, who derived jurisdiction and authority from the collective bargaining agreement, arbitrator lacked arbitral jurisdiction.  101 H. 11 (App.), 61 P.3d 522.</P>
