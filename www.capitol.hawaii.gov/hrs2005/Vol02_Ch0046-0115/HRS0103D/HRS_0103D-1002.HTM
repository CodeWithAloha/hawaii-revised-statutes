<P>&#9;(b)  All invitations for bids and requests for proposals shall include a description of the products that are listed in the Hawaii products list established pursuant to this section, and their established classes, which may be used to complete the scope of work specified in the invitation for bids or request for proposals, where the products are available and meet the minimum specifications.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  All persons submitting bids or proposals to claim a Hawaii products preference shall designate in their bids which individual product and its price is to be supplied as a Hawaii product.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Where a bid or proposal contains both Hawaii and non-Hawaii products, then for the purpose of selecting the lowest bid or purchase price only, the price bid or offered for a Hawaii product item shall be decreased by subtracting therefrom:  three per cent, five per cent, or ten per cent for the class I, class II, or class III Hawaii product items bid or offered, respectively.  The lowest total bid or proposal, taking the preference into consideration, shall be awarded the contract unless the bid or offer provides for additional award criteria.

<P>&#9;(f)  This section shall not apply whenever its application will disqualify any governmental agency from receiving federal funds or aid.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  Any purchase made or any contract awarded or executed in violation of this section shall be void and no payment shall be made by any purchasing agency on account of the purchase or contract.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  For the purposes of this section, "soil enhancement product" means any nonchemical soil preparation, conditioner, or compost mixture designed to supplement aeration or add organic, green waste, or decaying matter to the soil; provided that the term does not include any plant fertilizer intended to stimulate or induce plant growth through chemical means.  All state agencies shall include in their solicitations, when required, the soil enhancement products identified on the Hawaii products list pursuant to subsection (e).
