<P>  To determine whether ratification of an unlawfully awarded contract is in State's best interests, consideration must be given to State's interest in achieving the purposes of the procurement code.  85 H. 431, 946 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Where, if after award of contract, chief procurement officer finds no violation of law, but after de novo review pursuant to §103D-709, hearings officer finds otherwise, §103D-705 requires hearings officer to determine whether to ratify or terminate contract as provided in paragraph (1)(A) and (B).  85 H. 431, 946 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Whatever considerations may have driven the governmental body to terminate the contract, the hearings officer did not fail to carry out the officer's responsibilities under the procurement code because the officer did not need to consider the best interest of the State in accepting the parties' termination of the contract.  93 H. 155, 997 P.2d 567.</P>
