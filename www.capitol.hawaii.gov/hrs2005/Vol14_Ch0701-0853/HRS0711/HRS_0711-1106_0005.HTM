</B>
<P>  Act 292, Session Laws 1992, created the offense of harassment by stalking to strengthen the laws against harassment.  A person commits this offense if, with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person, or in reckless disregard of the risk thereof, a person pursues or conducts surveillance upon another without legitimate purpose and under circumstances which would cause the other to reasonably believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury or property damage.  Conference Committee Report No. 57.</P>
<P>  Act 68, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by requiring the defendant to engage in a course of conduct involving pursuit, surveillance, or nonconsensual contact on more than one occasion without legitimate purpose and defining "nonconsensual contact" as any contact that occurs without the individual's consent or in disregard of that person's express desire that the contact be avoided or discontinued.  Act 68 also repealed the distinction that a single occurrence of a prohibited conduct is a petty misdemeanor.  Conference Committee Report No. 54, House Standing Committee Report No. 1315.</P>
