</B>
<P>  The section makes it clear that a defendant in custody pending determination of the defendant's fitness to proceed or the defendant's penal responsibility shall be entitled to examination by medical experts of the defendant's own choice notwithstanding rules or regulations of the prison or hospital or other facility in which the defendant is held.  Final determination of the question of reasonable access should reside with the court and not with the warden or hospital administrator.</P>
