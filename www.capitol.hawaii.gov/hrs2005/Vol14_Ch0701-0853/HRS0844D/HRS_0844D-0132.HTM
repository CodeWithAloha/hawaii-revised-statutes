If the results of the DNA analysis are not favorable to the defendant, the court shall give notice of the results to probation or parole authorities, as appropriate.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Records reflecting the results of DNA analysis performed pursuant to this section, including the underlying data and laboratory notes, shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to chapter 92F except to the extent of a conclusion<U> </U>that a particular person was, or was not, the source of the biological evidence analyzed.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In any case as to which a motion is filed under this section, the prosecuting attorney shall give notice to the victim or surviving immediate family members of a homicide victim of the filing of the motion, any hearing that is held as a result, and its disposition.  For purposes of this subsection, "victim" and "surviving immediate family members" have the same meaning as in section 801D-2.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The court shall make appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its disposition of a motion made pursuant to this section, regardless of whether a hearing was held. [L 2005, c 112, pt of §1]</P>
