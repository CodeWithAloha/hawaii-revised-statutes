<P>&#9;(b)  Prior to final disposition or sentencing in a case, the court shall inquire and verify that the specimens, samples, or print impressions required by this chapter have been obtained and that this fact is included in the judgment.  The judgment issued by the court shall indicate that the court has ordered the person to comply with the requirements of this chapter and that the person shall be included in the state DNA database and data bank identification program and be subject to this chapter.  However, failure by the court to enter these facts in the judgment shall not invalidate a plea, conviction, or disposition, or otherwise relieve a person from the requirements of this chapter.
