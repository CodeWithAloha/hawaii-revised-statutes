The court may order this termination upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the covered offender:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Has had no new convictions for covered offenses;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Is very unlikely to commit a covered offense ever again; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Public access to the covered offender's public information will not assist in protecting the safety of the public or any member thereof;</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(g)  The following message shall be posted at both the site of internet access and on-site public access locations:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;"Information regarding covered offenders is permitted pursuant to chapter 846E.  Public access to this information is based solely on the fact of each offender's criminal conviction and is not based on an estimate of the offender's level of dangerousness.  By allowing public access to this information, the State makes no representation as to whether the covered offenders listed are dangerous.  Any person who uses the information in this registry to injure, harass, or commit a criminal act against any person included in the registry may be subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability, or both."</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A judgment on the verdict, or a finding of guilt after a plea of [guilty] or nolo contendere, excluding the adjudication of a minor;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A finding of unfitness to proceed resulting in the release of the covered offender into the community, excluding such a finding as to a minor; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;An acquittal due to a physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect pursuant to chapter 704 resulting in the release of the covered offender into the community, excluding such acquittal as to a minor.

</B>
<P>  As this section operated to deprive defendant of a protected liberty interest and provided defendant with neither notice nor an opportunity to be heard prior to notifying the public of defendant's status as a convicted sex offender, this section denied defendant due process under article I, §5 of the Hawaii constitution; this section thus void and unenforceable.  97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255.</P>
