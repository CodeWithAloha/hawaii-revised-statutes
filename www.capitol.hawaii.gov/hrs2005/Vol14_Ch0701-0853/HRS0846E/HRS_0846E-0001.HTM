<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Indecent exposure, in violation of §707-734, does not constitute an offense that entails "criminal sexual conduct" and, consequently, persons convicted of indecent exposure are not "sex offenders" for purposes of this chapter; thus, defendant was not required to register as a "sex offender" pursuant to this chapter.  102 H. 383, 76 P.3d 935.</P>
<P>  Under article I, §5, of the Hawaii constitution, due process requires that a convicted sex offender under this section be afforded the right to a judicial hearing at which evidence may be offered to demonstrate that continuance of all or part of the lifetime registration requirements are not necessary in a particular case to fulfill the public need to which the sex offender act responded.  105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242.</P>
