</B>
<P>  Act 192, Session Laws 1990, added this section in an attempt to afford a police officer some additional measure of protection.  The legislature noted that this measure may not have any deterrent effect because assaults on police officers usually happen in the heat of the moment.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1203-90.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Statutory references in oral charge did not cure the omission of essential elements in resisting arrest and assault against a police officer counts of the charge; supreme court unable to reasonably construe oral charge as charging assault against a police officer.  77 H. 309, 884 P.2d 372.</P>
