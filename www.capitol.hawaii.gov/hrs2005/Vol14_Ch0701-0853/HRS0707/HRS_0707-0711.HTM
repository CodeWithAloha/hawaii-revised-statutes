<P>&#9;(b)&#9;The person recklessly causes serious bodily injury to another person;</P>

<P>  Assault in the third degree is not a lesser included offense.  68 H. 276, 711 P.2d 1289.</P>
<P>  Circuit court was obligated, even absent a request by either party, to instruct the jury regarding the included offense of assault in third degree where appellant was charged with committing offense of assault in second degree; court's failure to do so constituted plain error.  76 H. 387, 879 P.2d 492.</P>
<P>  Conviction of defendant of offense of carrying, using or threatening to use a firearm in the commission of a separate felony under §134-6(a) and (e), the separate felony being second degree assault under subsection (1)(a), vacated where there was no substantial evidence that defendant caused substantial bodily injury to victim as required under subsection (1)(a).  94 H. 241, 11 P.3d 466.</P>
<P>  The plain and unambiguous language of §853-4(2) does not prohibit the grant of a deferred acceptance of no contest plea for assault in the second degree under this section causing "substantial bodily injury", as statutory prohibition expressly applies only to felony and misdemeanor assaults inflicting "bodily injury" or "serious bodily injury".  101 H. 409, 70 P.3d 635.</P>
<P>  Court's failure to personally engage defendant in on-the-record colloquy to determine whether defendant understood consequences of foregoing right to have jury instructed on third degree assault, the lesser-included offense of second degree assault, constituted plain error.  85 H. 44 (App.), 936 P.2d 1292.</P>
<P>  Trial court's omission of the "strongly corroborative" paragraph in the attempted assault in the second degree instructions was presumptively prejudicial and omission was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  104 H. 517 (App.), 92 P.3d 1027.</P>
<P>  Cited:  55 H. 531, 534, 523 P.2d 299.</P>
