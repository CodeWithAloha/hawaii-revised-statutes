<P>&#9;(c)  The legal prosecuting officer shall include within the exhibit evidence that is clearly exculpatory, but no information shall be dismissed for failure to include such evidence if the court finds that the inclusion of the clearly exculpatory evidence would not have changed the finding of probable cause.</P>
