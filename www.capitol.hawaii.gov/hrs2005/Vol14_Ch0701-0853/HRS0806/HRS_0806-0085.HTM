<P>&#9;(b)  A finding of the existence of probable cause or lack thereof may be based in whole or in part upon hearsay evidence or upon evidence that may ultimately be ruled to be inadmissible at the trial.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that the offense charged was committed and that the defendant committed the offense charged, the court shall set bail and direct the clerk to issue a warrant for the arrest of the defendant.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  As used in this section, "court having jurisdiction" and "court" mean the circuit court; provided that the chief justice may by order authorize district court judges to make probable cause determinations, set bail, and direct the issuance of arrest warrants, as provided by this section.
