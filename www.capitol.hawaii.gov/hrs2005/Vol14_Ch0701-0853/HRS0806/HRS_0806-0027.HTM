<P>&#9;No indictment shall be held invalid or insufficient for want of an averment that the grand jurors were impaneled, sworn, or charged; for want of a proper or formal conclusion; for want of or imperfection in the addition of any defendant; or because any person mentioned in the indictment is designated by a name of office or other descriptive appellation instead of the person's proper name; or because the initial of any person's given name is stated instead of the person's given name; or for want of a statement of value or price or the amount of damage or injury in any case where the value or price or the amount of damage or injury is not of the essence of the offense. </P>
<P>&#9;No indictment shall be deemed insufficient, nor shall the trial, judgment, or other proceedings thereon be affected, by reason of any defect or imperfection in matter or form, which shall not prejudice or tend to prejudice the defendant.
