</B>
<P>  Act 269, Session Laws 1998, added this section and §706-646 to allow victims of crime to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil judgment.  Under current law, a defendant may be required by the court to pay restitution for losses caused to the victim.  Collection of the restitution was left to governmental entities such as the judiciary, paroling authority, and department of public safety; these entities often were able to collect only a small fraction of the amount.  Moreover, although the criminal injuries compensation commission helped victims by providing some compensation, victims of property crimes and some violent crimes were ineligible for any compensation from the commission.  Furthermore, although a victim may bring a civil action against the defendant, the process was costly and time-consuming.  The legislature believed that victims should have a "fast track" ability to be compensated for their losses by allowing victims to enforce the criminal restitution order as a civil judgment, using all of the civil collection remedies.  Conference Committee Report No. 89.</P>
<P>  Act 113, Session Laws 2000, amended this section to authorize the waiver of filing fees when victims of crime seek civil enforcement of court-ordered restitution.  Conference Committee Report No. 40.</P>
