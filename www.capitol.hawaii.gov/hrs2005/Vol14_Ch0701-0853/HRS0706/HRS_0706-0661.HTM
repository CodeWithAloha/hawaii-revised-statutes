<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§706-661  Sentence of imprisonment for felony; extended terms.</B>  In the cases designated in section 706-662, a person who has been convicted of a felony may be sentenced to an extended indeterminate term of imprisonment.  When ordering such a sentence, the court shall impose the maximum length of imprisonment which shall be as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;For murder in the second degree--life without the possibility of parole;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;For a class A felony--indeterminate life term of imprisonment;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;For a class B felony--indeterminate twenty-year term of imprisonment; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;For a class C felony--indeterminate ten-year term of imprisonment.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;The minimum length of imprisonment for [paragraphs] (2), (3), and (4) shall be determined by the Hawaii paroling authority in accordance with section 706-669. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1976, c 92, §8; am L 1999, c 286, §2]</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Extended sentence imposed on multiple offender held not cruel and unusual punishment.  56 H. 343, 537 P.2d 724.</P>
<P>  Breach of plea agreement by prosecutor resulting from participation in extended term hearing may be remedied by remand for resentencing by another judge.  60 H. 93, 588 P.2d 412; 60 H. 104, 588 P.2d 408.</P>
<P>  Participation by prosecutor in hearing for extended term sentencing, even though pursuant to order of court, constituted breach of plea agreement.  60 H. 93, 588 P.2d 412.</P>
<P>  No abuse of discretion in court sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment under this section and §706-662 where, inter alia, court considered each of the factors enumerated in §706-606 and all the mitigating factors raised by defendant.  83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258.</P>
<P>  As §706-600 and this section do not authorize a court to impose a single sentence on a defendant who has been convicted of multiple charges, trial court did not violate plea agreement by  imposing a life term for each class A felony defendant was convicted of, and then running each life term concurrently.  91 H. 20, 979 P.2d 1046.</P>
