</B>
<P>  Act 205, Session Laws 2000, added this section to require a court, when sentencing a defendant to probation, to order the defendant to pay a probation services fee.  The legislature found that this was necessary to help defray the costs of administering probation services.  Conference Committee Report No. 45, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3375.</P>
<P>  Act 78, Session Laws 2004, amended this section to change the reference to the Interstate Parole and Probation Compact codified as part III of chapter 353 and repealed by Act 78, to reflect the new Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders, codified as chapter 353B.  House Standing Committee Report No. 176-04.</P>
