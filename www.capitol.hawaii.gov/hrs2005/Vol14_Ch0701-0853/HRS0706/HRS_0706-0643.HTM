</B>
<P>  This section provides for payment to the clerk of the sentencing court and incorporates previous provisions of law with respect to disposition of collected funds.  Out of an abundance of caution, subsection (2) deals with all funds collected in civil as well as penal cases.  This broad scope is made necessary by previous provisions of former Title 37 (Criminal Law) dealing with funds collected in civil cases.  See H.R.S. §§712-8 and 712-9 as codified prior to this Code.</P>
