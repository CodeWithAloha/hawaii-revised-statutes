<P>  Act 25, Special Session Laws 1995, added this section, which requires the judiciary to implement alternative programs that place, control, supervise, and treat selected defendants in lieu of an incarceration sentence.  The legislature addressed the problem of prison overcrowding by, inter alia, providing for the implementation of alternatives to incarceration that do not undermine public safety.
