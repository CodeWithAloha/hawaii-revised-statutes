<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§706-665  Former conviction in another jurisdiction.</B>  For purposes of sections 706-606.5, 706-620, and 706-662(1), a conviction of the commission of a crime in another jurisdiction shall constitute a previous conviction.  Such conviction shall be deemed to have been of a felony if sentence of death or of imprisonment in excess of one year was authorized under the law of such other jurisdiction.  Such a conviction shall be graded, for purposes of section 706-620 by comparing the maximum imprisonment authorized under the law of such other jurisdiction with the maximum imprisonment authorized for the relevant grade of felony. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §43]</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENTARY ON §706-665</P>
</B>
<P>  Since the minimal requirements for an extended term of imprisonment for a persistent offender deal in part with former convictions, it becomes necessary to treat the problem raised by former convictions in another jurisdiction.  The Code recognizes such convictions for purposes of §706-662.  In order to achieve a uniform standard for grading foreign convictions, the Code measures the authorized sentence in the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred according to the grading system of this Code.</P>
<P>  A problem is presented by the fact that some states authorize imprisonment for terms of more than one year for crimes denominated as misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors by the Code.  There is no easy answer to this dilemma.  For the purposes of determining the persistency of an offender, the power and integrity of the penal codes of other states must be recognized.  The court, however, is not compelled to order an extended term of imprisonment even if the minimal conditions are established.  Where a defendant's status as a persistent offender is based on foreign convictions which are greater than those authorized by the Code, the court is free not to make such a finding if, in the opinion of the court, it would result in undue hardship.</P>
