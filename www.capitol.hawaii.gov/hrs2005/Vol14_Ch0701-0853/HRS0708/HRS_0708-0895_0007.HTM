<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENTARY ON §§708-890 TO 895.7</P>
</B>
<P>  Act 33, Session Laws 2001, strengthened the State's computer crime laws, by, among other things, replacing statutes relating to computer crimes with several new offenses and provisions to deter computer fraud, damage, and other computer-related perpetrations, allowing the forfeiture of property used in computer crimes, and updating computer-related definitions to reflect modern technology and for clarity.  The legislature found that society was adopting at a rapid pace, computer technology to conduct activities of daily living.  Computer technology was being utilized not only for purposes of business and recreation, but also for criminal activity.  Thus, computer-related criminal activity was on the rise as society's dependence on computers increased.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1508.</P>
<P>  Act 3, Session Laws 2003, made a technical amendment to §708-890, by deleting the brackets around the word "retrieve" in the definition of "access".</P>
