</B>
<P>  Act 87, Session Laws 1996, added this section to the penal code and made the offense of unauthorized entry into motor vehicle a class C felony due to the increased number of car thefts in the State.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2598.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Appellant asserted that appellant's conviction for unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle was improper because applicable federal statutes governed, thereby precluding this statute from being assimilated into federal law; affirmed.  392 F.3d 1050.</P>
<P>  Specifying the particular crime intended to be committed is not an essential element which must be alleged in order to charge the crime of unauthorized entry into motor vehicle.  97 H. 492, 40 P.3d 894.</P>
<P>  For the purposes of this section, "entry" is defined as the least intrusion into a motor vehicle with the whole physical body, with any part of the body, or with any instrument appurtenant to the body introduced for the purpose of committing a crime against a person or against property rights.  100 H. 383, 60 P.3d 333.</P>
