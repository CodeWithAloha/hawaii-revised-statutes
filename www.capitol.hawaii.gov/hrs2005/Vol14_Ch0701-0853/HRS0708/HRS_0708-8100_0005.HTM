<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENTARY ON §708-8100.5</P>
</B>
<P>  Act 287, Session Laws 1993, added this section to provide criminal sanctions for the fraudulent encoding of a credit card.  The legislature found that criminal elements are now capable of changing the magnetic encoding on a credit card to match a usable code and then use the card without detection, resulting in tremendous potential loss to the State's commerce.  The legislature further found that because this type of crime is more serious and sophisticated than simple credit card fraud or simple theft and the potential for economic loss is so great, classification of this offense as a class B felony is appropriate.
