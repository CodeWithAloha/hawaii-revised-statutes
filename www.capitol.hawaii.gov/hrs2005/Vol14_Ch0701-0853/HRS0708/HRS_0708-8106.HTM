</B>
<P>  Act 314, Session Laws 1986, incorporated into the Code the credit card offenses previously included under chapter 851.  Apart from this change, credit card offense penalties were made more severe in recognition of the increase in the criminal abuse of credit cards.  Also, Act 314 barred the disclosure of credit cardholder lists, except in limited circumstances, because the procurement from stores and credit bureaus of those lists increases the likelihood of credit card fraud and theft.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 820-86, Conference Committee Report No. 51-86. </P>
<P>  Act 55, Session Laws 1988, amended §708-8100 by lowering the value of money, goods, and services, required as an element of credit card fraud in the class C felony category, from $500 to $300.  This amendment makes this section uniform with similar statutory crimes.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1173-88.</P>
