<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§708-828  Criminal use of a noxious substance.</B>  (1)  A person commits the offense of criminal use of a noxious substance if the person knowingly deposits on the premises or in the vehicle of another, without the other's consent, any stink bomb or device, irritant, or offensive-smelling substance, with the intent to interfere with another's use of the premises or vehicle. </P>
<P>&#9;(2)  Criminal use of a noxious substance is a petty misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1]</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENTARY ON §708-828</P>
</B>
<P>  This section recognizes that the use value of a person's property may be impaired by the use of noxious substances without the involvement of tampering (§§708-826 to 827) or actual damage (§§708-820 to 823).  This form of interference with the use of property can be significantly grave to warrant the low grade of criminal sanction provided by this section. </P>
<P>  Under previous Hawaii law, the conduct described in this section would fall within the ambit of the indiscriminately- defined offense of common nuisance.[1]  The Code sharpens the focus and definition of the offense, as it relates to noxious substances, and reduces slightly the possible penalty. </P>
