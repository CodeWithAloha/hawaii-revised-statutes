<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Where defendant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support claim of the exercise of a constitutionally protected native Hawaiian right and knowingly entered landowner's property which was fenced in a manner to exclude others, trial court properly concluded that defendant was unlawfully on property in violation of subsection (1).  89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</P>
<P>  Where persons were allowed on hotel premises if invited by hotel guests, State had burden to prove that defendants were not so invited.  2 H. App. 264, 630 P.2d 129.</P>
<P>  As criminal liability in section (1993) based only on contemporaneous refusal to obey warning or request to leave premises, no conviction where defendant returned to bar more than a month after being given warning not to return to premises for a year.  80 H. 372 (App.), 910 P.2d 143.</P>
<P>  Finding by court that property was "commercial premises" protected by this section not clearly erroneous.  80 H. 460 (App.), 911 P.2d 95.</P>
