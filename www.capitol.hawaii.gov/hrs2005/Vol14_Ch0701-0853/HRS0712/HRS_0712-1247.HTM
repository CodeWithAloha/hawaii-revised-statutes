<P>&#9;(2)  Promoting a detrimental drug in the first degree is a class C felony.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  Any marijuana seized as evidence of a violation of this section in excess of one pound may be destroyed after it has been photographed and the weight thereof recorded.  The remainder of the marijuana shall remain in the custody of the police department until the termination of any criminal action brought as a result of the seizure of the marijuana.  Photographs duly identified as accurately representing the marijuana shall be deemed competent evidence of the marijuana involved and shall be admissible in any proceeding, hearing, or trial to the same extent as the marijuana itself; provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit or to restrict the application of Rule 901 of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1975, c 163, §6(i); am L 1981, c 31, §3 and c 123, §1; am L 1986, c 314, §75; am L 1989, c 384, §2]</P>

</B>
<P>  Where violation of misdemeanor offense under subsection (1)(d) also constituted violation of felony offense under §712-1247(1)(h), conviction of felony offense would have constituted violation of defendant's due process and equal protection rights.  86 H. 48, 947 P.2d 360.</P>
<P>  Since to sell and to barter do not include to prescribe, §712-1248(1)(d) is not a lesser included offense of §712-1247(1)(h).  78 H. 488 (App.), 896 P.2d 944.</P>
