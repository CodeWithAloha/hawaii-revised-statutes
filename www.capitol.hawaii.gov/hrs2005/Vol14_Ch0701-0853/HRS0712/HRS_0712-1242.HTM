</B>
<P>  Procuring agency defense is not applicable to charge under subsection (1)(c).  58 H. 234, 566 P.2d 1370.</P>
<P>  Instruction was erroneous which required the jury to find that defendant knew the substance was heroin upon the State's showing by chemical analysis that it was heroin.  61 H. 308, 603 P.2d 141.</P>
<P>  The procuring agent defense is unavailable to a charge of promoting a dangerous drug.  71 H. 134, 785 P.2d 941.</P>
<P>  Because undisputed evidence at trial was that defendant did nothing more than offer to buy cocaine from police sergeant, defendant did not, as a matter of law, violate subsection (1)(c).  78 H. 317, 893 P.2d 168.</P>
<P>  In the absence of a bill of particulars, where the evidence adduced at trial proves only a sale and a reasonable juror could find that the defendant did not act on the seller's behalf, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on the procuring agent defense.  93 H. 279, 1 P.3d 281.</P>

<P>  Chain of custody requirements.  1 H. App. 546, 622 P.2d 620.</P>
