<P>  Act 53, Session Laws 1996, added this section to prohibit the sale of single cigarettes or cigarettes in packs of less than twenty and in other than in sealed packages originating with the manufacturer and bearing the required health warning.  The legislature found that the sale of cigarettes in amounts of less than twenty was specifically aimed at minors.  The legislature sought to prevent the distribution of cigarettes to minors through quantity and price control.

<P>  Act 201, Session Laws 2000, amended this section by increasing to a class C felony the penalty for anyone who knowingly sells single cigarettes or packs of cigarettes containing less than twenty cigarettes.  Conference Committee Report No. 108.</P>
