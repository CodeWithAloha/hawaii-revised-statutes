</B>
<P>  Act 181, Session Laws 1979, established this part to provide a remedy to abate as nuisances, offenses against public health and morals in the nature of offenses defined as prostitution, the display of indecent matter, and the like.  It is based largely on sections 11225 to 11235 of the California Penal Code.</P>
<P>  Act 158, Session Laws 1990, amended this section to expand the nuisance law to permit closure of premises where drug offenses repeatedly occur.  The legislature emphasized that this amendment is not intended to be applied to innocent landlords whose property may be inadvertently involved in drug offenses.  Conference Committee Report No. 30.</P>
