<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§805-1  Complaint; form of warrant.</B>  When a complaint is made to any prosecuting officer of the commission of any offense, the prosecuting officer shall examine the complainant, shall reduce the substance of the complaint to writing, and shall cause the same to be subscribed by the complainant under oath, which the prosecuting officer is hereby authorized to administer.  If the original complaint results from the issuance of a traffic summons or a citation in lieu of an arrest pursuant to section 803-6, by a police officer, the oath may be administered by any police officer whose name has been submitted to the prosecuting officer and who has been designated by the chief of police to administer the oath.  Upon presentation of the written complaint to the judge within whose circuit the offense is alleged to have been committed, the judge shall issue a warrant, reciting the complaint and requiring the sheriff, or other officer to whom it is directed (except as provided in section 805-3), forthwith to arrest the accused and bring the accused before the judge to be dealt with according to law; and in the same warrant may require the officer to summon such witnesses as are named therein to appear and give evidence at the trial.  The warrant may be in the form established by the usage and practice of the issuing court.
