<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENTARY ON §702-218</P>
</B>
<P>  [Section 218, as contained in the Proposed Draft of the Code provided that ignorance or mistake of fact or law was a defense under the conditions stated above.  The following commentary is based on this initial proposal for §218.]</P>
<P>  This section states the logical concomitant of the requirement that to establish each element of an offense a certain state of mind with respect thereto must be proven.  Thus, if a person is ignorant or mistaken as to a matter of fact or law, the person's ignorance or mistake will, in appropriate circumstances, prevent the person from having the requisite culpability with respect to the fact or law as it actually exists.  For example, a person who is mistaken (either reasonably, negligently, or recklessly) as to which one of a number of similar umbrellas on a rack is the person's and who takes another's umbrella should be afforded a defense to a charge of theft predicated on either intentionally or knowingly taking the property of another.  Also, a person, mistaken as to the effect of a divorce decree erroneously purporting to sever the marital ties of his wife, who marries another woman should not be convicted of bigamy if bigamy requires knowledge by the defendant of the defendant's existing marital status.  A reckless mistake would afford a defense to a charge requiring intent or knowledge--but not to an offense which required only recklessness or negligence.  Similarly, a negligent mistake would afford a defense to a charge predicated on intent, knowledge, or recklessness--but not to an offense based on negligence.</P>
<P>  This section of the Code deals with ignorance or mistake of fact or law, but it is not intended to deal with the limited problem of the defense afforded a person who engaged in conduct under the mistaken belief that the conduct itself was not legally prohibited.  That problem is dealt with exclusively by §702-220.</P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law recognized a defense based on ignorance or mistake of fact[1] or law,[2] but usually the law required that the ignorance or mistake be reasonable.[3]  The Code correlates the culpability required for commission of the offense with the culpability which will deprive ignorance or mistake of effect as a defense.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §702-218</P>
</B>
<P>  The Legislature in dealing with §702-218 deleted a defense based on mistake of law.  The Legislature said that it was "thereby avoiding a major dilemma with respect to enforcement of the provisions of this Code.  The defenses of ignorance of the law afforded by §§702-218 and 220 would have been available, to a degree, under any given set of circumstances and as such would have constituted a major encumbrance to enforcement of the substance and spirit of the Code."  See Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).</P>
<P>  Although the Legislature did not provide for a defense based on mistake of law, the State Supreme Court has recognized that, in some instances, there must exist, as a necessary corollary to the definition to certain offenses, a defense based on this type of mistake.  See State v. Marley, 54 Haw. 450, 476-477, 509 P.2d 1095, 1111-1112 (1973).  The court cited §702-220 of the Hawaii Penal Code as providing a defense to a state trespass prosecution in the case of honest and reasonable belief ("no matter how incorrect such a belief might be") that another law (American treaty law) afforded a defense to the trespass.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Where a defendant has adduced evidence at trial supporting an instruction on the statutory defense of ignorance or mistake of fact, the trial court must, at the defendant's request, separately instruct as to the defense, notwithstanding that the trial court has also instructed regarding the state of mind requisite to the charged offense.  100 H. 195, 58 P.3d 1242.</P>
