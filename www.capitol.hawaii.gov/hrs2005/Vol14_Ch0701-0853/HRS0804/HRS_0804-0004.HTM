<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§804-4  When a matter of right.</B>  (a)  If the charge is for an offense for which bail is allowable under section 804-3, the defendant may be admitted to bail before conviction as a matter of right.  Except for section 712-1207(7), bail shall be allowed for any person charged under section 712-1207 only subject to the mandatory condition that the person observe geographic restrictions that prohibit the defendant from entering or remaining on public property, in Waikiki and other areas in the State designated by county ordinance during the hours from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.; and provided further that nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the imposition of stricter geographic restrictions under section 804-7.1.  The right to bail shall continue after conviction of a misdemeanor, petty misdemeanor, or violation, and release on bail may continue, in the discretion of the court, after conviction of a felony until the final determination of any motion for a new trial, appeal, habeas corpus, or other proceedings that are made, taken, issued, or allowed for the purpose of securing a review of the rulings, verdict, judgment, sentence, or other proceedings of any court or jury in or by which the defendant has been arraigned, tried, convicted, or sentenced; provided that:</P><DIR>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;No bail shall be allowed after conviction and prior to sentencing in cases where bail was not available under section 804-3, or where bail was denied or revoked before conviction;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;No bail shall be allowed pending appeal of a felony conviction where a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;No bail shall be allowed pending appeal of a conviction for a violation of section 712-1207, unless the court finds, based on the defendant's record, that the defendant may be admitted to bail subject to the mandatory condition that the person observe geographic restrictions that prohibit the defendant from entering or walking along the public streets or sidewalks of Waikiki or other areas in the State designated by county ordinance pursuant to section 712-1207 during the hours from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any person who violates these bail restrictions shall have the person's bail revoked after hearing and shall be imprisoned forthwith.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The court shall order that a person who has been found guilty of an offense and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and who has filed an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari, be detained, unless the court finds:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;By clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;That the appeal is not for purpose of delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>If the court makes these findings, the court shall order the release of the person in accordance with section 804-7.1.  No defendant entitled to bail, whether bailed or not, shall be subject, without the defendant's written consent, to the operation of any sentence passed upon the defendant, while any proceedings to procure a review of any action of the trial court or jury in the premises are pending and undetermined, except as provided in section 641-14(a) or section 712-1207.
