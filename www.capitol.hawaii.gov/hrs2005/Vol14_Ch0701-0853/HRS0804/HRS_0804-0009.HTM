<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§<B>804-9  Amount.</B>  The amount of bail rests in the discretion of the justice or judge or the officers named in section 804-5; but should be so determined as not to suffer the wealthy to escape by the payment of a pecuniary penalty, nor to render the privilege useless to the poor.  In all cases, the officer letting to bail should consider the punishment to be inflicted on conviction, and the pecuniary circumstances of the party accused.

<P>  Since §804-5 provides chief of police or designee with independent authority and discretion to admit persons charged with misdemeanor offenses to bail in accordance with this section, senior judge of family court lacked authority to issue a bail schedule divesting police of that authority and discretion.  75 H. 357, 861 P.2d 1205.</P>
