Such inquiries shall be made prior to any dissemination except in those cases where the agency determines that time is of the essence and the center is technically incapable of responding within the necessary time period, provided, however, that where local criminal justice agencies have entered into agreements for the sharing of a computerized criminal history record information system, the agency operating such system shall not be required to query the data center prior to disseminating information to the agencies which are party to the agreements.
