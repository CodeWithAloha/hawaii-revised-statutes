<P>&#9;(2)  Real property subject to forfeiture under this chapter may be seized for forfeiture by a law enforcement officer pursuant to court order following a pre-seizure hearing in the circuit court in the circuit in which the property is located with notice of the pre-seizure hearing to be made to the owners and interest-holders pursuant to section 712A-8.  The court shall order the real property in question to be seized for forfeiture if it finds probable cause that the real property is subject to forfeiture under any provision of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  In determining probable cause for seizure, the fact that a firearm, money, or any negotiable instrument was found in proximity to contraband or to instrumentalities of an offense gives rise to an inference that the money, or instrument was the proceeds of contraband or that the firearm, money or instrument was used or intended to be used to facilitate commission of the offense.
