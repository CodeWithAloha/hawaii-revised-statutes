<P>&#9;(2)  It is no defense to a prosecution under this section that the office the person pretended to hold did not in fact exist. </P>
<P>&#9;(3)  Impersonating a public servant is a misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1984, c 139, §2; am L 2001, c 91, §4]</P>

</B>
<P>  The object of this section is to prevent imposition on people by the false pretense of authority. </P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law recognized the offense of false personation of a government officer and imposed a possible maximum sentence of one year's imprisonment or a fine of $100.[1]  The Code authorizes the same imprisonment, but a greater fine, for misdemeanors.  Excluded from Part II are offenses involving falsity which borders on perjury, e.g., false application or consent to marriage, false impersonation before a court.[2]  These problems are dealt with directly in Part VI of this chapter.  Statutory protection for private fraternal organizations, by making unauthorized display of the badge or insignia of the organization a crime, is eliminated.[3]  Also eliminated is the questionable distinction between the penalty which attaches to the unauthorized wearing of a police officer's uniform or badge and that which attaches to the unauthorized wearing of a uniform or badge which resembles a police officer's.[4]  Both situations are covered equally under this section provided other requirements are met. </P>
