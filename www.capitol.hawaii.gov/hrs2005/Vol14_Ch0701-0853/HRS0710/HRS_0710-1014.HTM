</B>
<P>  The rendering of a false fire alarm is almost universally made criminal.  The Code generalizes the principle to cover all emergency alarms and all governmental emergency organizations (the police would be included while responding to an alarm of this character), public utilities that deal with emergencies, and, in the case of fire departments, volunteer organizations.  The justification for the provision is the prevention of the "waste of government resources and the likelihood that the actor will cause personnel or equipment to be unavailable to deal with real emergencies."[1] </P>
