<P>  Act 223, Session Laws 1991, added this section which provides a penalty for destroying or defacing official notices.  The legislature felt that a protected notice should contain a statement that the destruction, removal or defacement of an official notice is prohibited by law, in order to make it clear to the public the importance of the document.
