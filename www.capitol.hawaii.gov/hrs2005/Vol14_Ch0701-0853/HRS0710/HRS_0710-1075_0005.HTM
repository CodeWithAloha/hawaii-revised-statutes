</B>
<P>  Act 156, Session Laws 1981, enacted this section to provide additional protection to jurors.  Although the prior law penalized force or threats used against a juror before or during a trial, it contained no provision dealing specifically with the offense of force or threats directed against a person for the person's actions as a juror, after the trial. </P>
