</B>
<P>  Act 156, Session Laws 1981, enacted this section to provide additional protection to witnesses.  Although the prior law penalized force or threats used against a person about to be called as a witness, it had no provisions dealing specifically with the offense of force or threats directed against a person for having served as a witness.</P>
