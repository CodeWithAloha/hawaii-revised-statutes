<P>&#9;(a)&#9;Influence the testimony of that person;</P>

</B>
<P>  The potential for harm involved in witness intimidation is essentially similar to that involved in the offense of bribery of a witness, e.g., the undermining of the integrity of an extremely important part of the judicial process.  The definition of the offense also parallels that of bribery of a witness, and the sanctions are identical.  Note, however, that only the person who directs the force or threat against the witness is guilty of a crime.  "Threat," as used in this section is any threat proscribed by the offense of criminal coercion under §707-724.  To some extent, it would seem that the section on criminal coercion might suffice to deal with witness intimidation, but since the intimidation of a witness carries the additional harm of interfering with an official proceeding, it seems appropriate to impose a more severe sanction for the present offense.</P>
<P>  Previous Hawaii law had no provisions dealing specifically with the offense of witness intimidation.</P>
