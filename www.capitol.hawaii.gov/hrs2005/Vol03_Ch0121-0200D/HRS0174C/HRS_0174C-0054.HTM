<P>  Petitions for interim instream flow standard amendments are not among the water use permit applications "competing" under this section; the statute relating to instream use protection, §174C-71, operates independently of the procedures for water use regulation outlined in this part.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</P>
