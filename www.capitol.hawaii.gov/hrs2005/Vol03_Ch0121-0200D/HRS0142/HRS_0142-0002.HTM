<P>  Department established quarantine pursuant to this section; without reasonable modifications to quarantine requirement for benefit of visually-impaired individuals who rely on guide dogs, quarantine requirement effectively prevented those persons from enjoying benefits of state services and activities in violation of Americans with Disabilities Act.  81 F.3d 1480.</P>
<P>  In case arising from plaintiff and plaintiff's hearing guide dog's encounter with Hawaii's animal quarantine laws, where plaintiff alleged that in the course of enforcing animal quarantine laws, defendants deprived plaintiff of various constitutional, statutory, and common law rights, plaintiff's claim, among others, under (1) Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) against defendant in defendant's individual capacity dismissed, as an action under Title II of the ADA may not be maintained against public actors in their individual capacities; and (2) §504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 dismissed as plaintiff did not allege that the program received federal financial assistance.  128 F. Supp. 2d 684.</P>
