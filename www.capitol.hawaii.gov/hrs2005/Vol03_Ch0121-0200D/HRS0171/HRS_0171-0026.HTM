<P>&#9;Prior to the leasing of any lands, the board shall determine the feasibility of hunting on such lands, and if any of them is suitable for hunting or may during the term of the lease become suitable for hunting, the board may reserve such lands as game management areas or public hunting areas.  Where the board finds that hunting on such lands would not be consistent with the rights of the lessee or for other good cause, the board need not reserve such lands as game management areas or public hunting areas.</P>
<P>&#9;The cost of such rights-of-way and any fencing which may be required shall be borne by the State, lessee or jointly as the board may deem appropriate prior to the leasing of such lands.
