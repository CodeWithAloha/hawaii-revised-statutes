<P>&#9;However, no final action involving disposition of public lands may be had at such special meeting.</P>
<P>&#9;Any action taken by the board shall be by a simple majority of the members of the board; provided that a simple majority of the members present at a meeting and qualified to vote shall be required to allow any decision pursuant to section 183C-6(b).  Four members of the board shall constitute a quorum to do business.  The board shall keep accurate records and minutes of all meetings, special and regular, and they shall be public records.

<P>  A quorum of the board is sufficient to conduct business, but any board action must be authorized by a majority of the total membership of the board (pre-2001 amendment).  102 H. 257, 75 P.3d 160.</P>
<P>  Where a majority of the board (pre-2001 amendment) did not affirmatively approve or disapprove of electric company's application to modernize and expand electric generating station on conservation land within the time established, the board failed to render a "decision" so as to avoid the 180-day default mechanism of §183-41; thus, electric company was allowed to subject land to the use applied for.  102 H. 257, 75 P.3d 160.</P>
