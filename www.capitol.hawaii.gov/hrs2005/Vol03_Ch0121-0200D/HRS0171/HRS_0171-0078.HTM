<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§171-78  Notice; drawing.</B>  No residential lease shall be made unless notice of the board of land and natural resources' intention to lease, with such details concerning the intended lease and method of application for the lease as the board deems necessary or desirable, is published as provided in section 171-16(b).  The person entitled to the lease shall be determined by drawing from among the qualified applicants who have submitted evidence satisfactory to the board of loan commitments, still in force, from recognized lending institutions to finance the construction of a residence upon the premises.  Only those who are entitled to preference may participate in the drawing, and one of them shall be entitled to the lease of the lot offered, or if more than one lot is offered, they shall have their choice among the lots offered, according to the numbers drawn by them.  If there are more lots than qualified applicants entitled to preference, those without preference may participate in the drawing after all preferred qualified applicants have made their choices.  Any lease referred to in the published notice which is not taken upon the drawing may thereafter be leased to any qualified applicant for a residential lease having a loan commitment, still in force, from a recognized lending institution to finance the construction of a residence upon the premises, notwithstanding the person was not an applicant at the date of the drawing, without further publication of notice and without further drawing, if the lease is made within one year of the date of the drawing of which notice was published. [L 1962, c 32, pt of §2; Supp, §103A-74; HRS §171-78]</P>
