Upon application by the owner and consent therefor having been given by each holder of record having a security interest, and after a finding that the public interest will be served thereby, the board of land and natural resources may amend or waive the conditions restricting the use of land contained in any agreement of sale, deed, or patent upon the condition that the grantee or patentee pay to the board the difference between the fair market value of the land based upon its restricted use and the fair market value with the restrictive condition amended or waived.  The foregoing authority granted to the board shall not be construed to authorize the board to waive the condition contained in any agreement of sale, deed, or patent which provides that upon change in use or breach of a condition, the title automatically reverts back to the State, or the State shall have power of termination.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Residential lots.  In case of a residential lot, the board, subject to the consent of each holder of record having a security interest, may waive strict adherence to the use thereof for residential purposes, if the owner or lessee desires to utilize part of the land for agricultural purposes together with the owner's or lessee's residence, provided that the agricultural use is not inconsistent or contrary to local applicable health or zoning ordinances and upon the condition that the grantee or patentee pay to the board the difference between the fair market value of the land based upon its restricted use and the fair market value with the restrictive condition amended or waived.  The foregoing authority granted to the board shall not be construed to authorize the board to waive the condition contained in any agreement of sale, deed, or patent which provides that upon change in use or breach of a condition, the title automatically reverts back to the State, or the State shall have power of termination.  Anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, in case of a residential lot sold in fee simple:</P><DIR>
