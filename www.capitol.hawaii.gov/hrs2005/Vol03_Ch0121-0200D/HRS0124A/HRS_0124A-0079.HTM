<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§124A-79]  Record of trial.</B>  (a)  Each court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings of the trial of each case brought before it and the record shall be authenticated by the signatures of the president and the law officer.  If the record cannot be authenticated by either the president or the law officer, by reason of the president's or law officer's death, disability, or absence, it shall be signed by a member in lieu of the president or law officer.  If both the president and the law officer are unavailable, the record shall be authenticated by two members.  A record of the proceedings of a trial in which the sentence adjudged includes a bad-conduct discharge or is more than that which could be adjudged by a special court-martial shall contain a verbatim account of the proceedings and testimony before the court.  All other records of trial shall contain such matter and be authenticated in such manner as the governor may by rule prescribe.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.  If a verbatim record of trial by general court-martial is not required by subsection (a), but has been made, the accused may buy such a record under such rules as the governor may adopt. [L 1982, c 171, pt of §2; gen ch 1985]</P>
