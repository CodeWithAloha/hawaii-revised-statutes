<P>&#9;(b)  Unless and except as otherwise provided by law, whenever the corporation undertakes, or causes to be undertaken, any project facility as part of a project, the cost of providing the project facilities shall be assessed against the real property in the project area specially benefiting from the project facilities.  Subject to the express written consent of the landowners directly affected, the corporation shall determine the properties that will benefit from the project facilities to be undertaken and may establish assessment areas that include the properties specially benefiting from the project facilities.

Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, in assessing real property for project facilities, the corporation shall assess the real property within a project area according to the special benefits conferred upon the real property by the project facilities.  These methods may include assessment on a frontage basis or according to the area of real property within a project area, or any other assessment method that assesses the real property according to the special benefit conferred, or any combination thereof.  No such assessment levies against real property specially benefited under this chapter shall constitute a tax on real property within the meaning of any law.</P>
