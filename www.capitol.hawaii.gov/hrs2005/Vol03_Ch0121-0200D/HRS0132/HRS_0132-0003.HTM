The state fire code, insofar as is practicable, shall complement, augment and be consistent in form and language with the building and other codes of the respective counties.  Upon adoption by the state fire council, the state fire code shall be transmitted to the respective county councils which may, by ordinance, either enact its provisions or enact more stringent provisions relating to protection of persons and property against fire loss; provided that the county councils may enact less stringent provisions with the prior written approval of the state fire council.  The state fire council shall meet annually to review and amend the state fire code.
