No private entity shall assess or charge any homeowner any fees for the placement of any solar energy device.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Any person may place a solar energy device on any single-family residential dwelling or townhouse unit owned by that person, provided that:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The owner and each successive owner of the single-family residential dwelling or townhouse unit on which the device is placed shall be responsible for any costs for damages to the device, the common elements, limited common elements, and any adjacent units, arising or resulting from the installation, maintenance, repair, removal, or replacement of the device.  The repair, maintenance, removal, and replacement responsibilities shall be assumed by each successive owner until the solar energy device has been removed from the common elements or limited common elements.  The owner and each successive owner shall at all times have and maintain a policy of insurance covering the obligations of the owner under this paragraph and shall name the private entity as an additional insured under said policy; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The owner and any successive owner of the single-family residential dwelling or townhouse unit on which the device is placed shall be responsible for removing the solar energy device if reasonably necessary or convenient for the repair, maintenance, or replacement of the common elements or limited common elements. </P></DIR>

The homeowner shall provide the private entity with a copy of the confirmation.</P>
