The governor shall be the sole judge of the existence of the danger, threat, state of affairs, or circumstances.  A period of civil defense emergency proclaimed pursuant to the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 shall terminate as therein provided, and a period of civil defense emergency proclaimed by the governor shall terminate upon proclamation by the governor.
