<P>&#9;(1)&#9;That floods caused by heavy rainstorms and abnormal tidal action are detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the State, resulting in jeopardy to and the loss of life and property, disruption of commerce, and interruption of transportation and communications; that the reduction of flood damage is therefore of primary importance to the people of the State; and the conservation and beneficial use of flood water is an essential adjunct to rainfall drainage and flood control.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the coordination by the State of all federal and state flood control projects undertaken in Hawaii and for such technical or financial assistance to its political subdivisions as may be desirable or necessary to assure maximum benefits to the people of the State from the expenditure of state funds for flood control purposes.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any political subdivision through its proper officials from requesting federal aid on its own initiative and at its own expense without having to secure state approval. [L 1961, c 34, §1; am L 1963, c 148, pt of §1; Supp, §87C-1; HRS §179-1]</P>
