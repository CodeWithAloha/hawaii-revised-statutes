Any amount of such deposit in excess of the amount required to reimburse the State shall be returned by the department to the party which has made such deposit.</P>
<P>&#9;The department shall not enter into any project agreement with respect to any project unless the legislature shall have first authorized the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance such project pursuant to section 39A-157 and the department has thereafter found and determined either that the project party is a responsible party, whether by reason of economic assets or experience in the type of enterprise to be undertaken through such project, or otherwise, or that the obligations of the project party under the project agreement will be unconditionally guaranteed by a person who is a responsible party, whether by reason of economic assets or experience in the type of enterprise to be undertaken through such project, or otherwise.
