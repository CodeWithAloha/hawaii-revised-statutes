<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§<B>39A-198  Special purpose revenue bond anticipation notes.</B>  Whenever the department authorizes the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds under this part, special purpose revenue bond anticipation notes of the department may be issued in anticipation of the issuance of such bonds and of the receipt of the proceeds of sale thereof, for the purposes for which such bonds have been authorized.  All special purpose revenue bond anticipation notes shall be authorized by the department, and the maximum principal amount of such notes shall not exceed the authorized principal amount of such bonds.  The notes shall be payable solely from and secured solely by the proceeds of sale of the special purpose revenue bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued and the revenues from which would be payable and by which would be secured such bonds; provided that to the extent that the principal of the notes shall be paid from moneys other than the proceeds of sale of such bonds, the maximum amount of bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued that has been authorized shall be reduced by the amount of notes paid in such manner.  The authorization, issuance, and the details of such notes shall be governed by the provisions of this part with respect to special purpose revenue bonds insofar as the provisions may be applicable; provided that each note, together with all renewals and extensions thereof, or refundings thereof by other notes issued under this section, shall mature within five years from the date of the original note.
