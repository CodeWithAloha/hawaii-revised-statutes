</B>
<B><P>Ex post facto law.</P>
</B><P>  Ex post facto clause did not bar aggregation of amounts of contraband distributed before and after effective date of federal statute during course of single ongoing conspiracy.  938 F.2d 972.</P>
<P>  No ex post facto clause violation despite crew members' claims that possession of drugs on ship became illegal only when ship's flag nation consented to authority of U.S. law.  35 F.3d 426.</P>
<P>  Not violated by rule that, for purposes of criminal history calculation, state conviction for conduct which occurred after defendant's federal offense, but for which defendant was sentenced before defendant's sentencing on the federal offense, is counted as a prior sentence.  44 F.3d 749.</P>
<P>  Applicability of provisions of Title IV of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L. No. 108-21, and amendments to U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual in defendant's sentencing, where defendant's criminal conduct clearly preceded the enactment of the relevant law, discussed.  302 F. Supp. 2d 1170.</P>

<B><P>Habeas corpus.</P>
</B><P>  Where applicants, passengers on vessel intercepted by U.S. Coast Guard and brought to Midway Island, argued that Immigration and Nationality Act effectively eliminated habeas jurisdiction and that such a repeal violated the suspension clause, Congress had not provided the benefit of a habeas corpus proceeding for aliens who were not in the United States; thus, applicants had no constitutional claim.  71 F. Supp. 2d 1052.</P>
