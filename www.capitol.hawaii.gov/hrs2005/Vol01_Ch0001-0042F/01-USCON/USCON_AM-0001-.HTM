<P>&#9;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Attorney General Opinions</P>
</B>
<P>  Statute which would include newspapers within definition of public utility and subject them to PUC jurisdiction would be violative of freedom of the press.  Att. Gen. Op. 74-11.</P>
<P>  Licensing of church-sponsored day care programs constitutional.  Att. Gen. Op. 85-25.</P>
<P>  Section 445-112(11), regulating political signs, was unconstitutional and unenforceable.  Att. Gen. Op. 96-4.</P>
<P>  Section 452-23(a)(4), (5), and (6) was overly broad and infringed upon commercial speech rights afforded by First Amendment.  Att. Gen. Op. 98-2.</P>
<P>  Section 11-204(b): violates First Amendment because it restricts persons or other entities from making contributions to noncandidate ballot measure committees.  Section 11-204(j):  statutory provision prohibits contributions based upon length of time that noncandidate committee has been registered; this durational requirement is unconstitutional because it imposes limitations on the right of association and the right of expression when contributions are made to noncandidate committees.  Att. Gen. Op. 98-5.</P>
<P>  Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that an Ohio school voucher program did not violate the establishment clause, was inapposite in Hawaii; a publicly-funded Hawaii school voucher program would violate article X, §1 of the state constitution.  Att. Gen. Op. 03-1.</P>

<P>  Prison officials entitled to 42 U.S.C. §1983 qualified immunity from inmate's claim of retaliatory punishment for exercising inmate's First Amendment rights where reasonable prison official would have believed that inmate's transfer from minimum to medium security facility was lawful, advancing legitimate penological goals.  55 F.3d 454.</P>
<P>  Where appellants claimed, inter alia, that restrictions imposed on organizations who chose to receive Legal Services Corporation funds were unconstitutional because they conditioned the receipt of a benefit, the grant of federal funds, on the relinquishment of the right to engage in protected activities, appellants' unconstitutional conditions argument was without merit because neither the congressional enactments nor the implementing regulations infringed on First Amendment rights.  145 F.3d 1017.</P>
<P>  Government cannot require an individual to relinquish First Amendment rights as a condition of employment.  437 F. Supp. 368.</P>

<P>  Service of process is an expressive act protected by the First Amendment.  823 F. Supp. 806.</P>
<P>  With the ability to control the separately incorporated and insular second organization, alternative channels existed for Legal Services Corporation-funded organizations to pursue their constitutionally protected activities; thus, the Legal Services Corporation regulations did not constitute an unconstitutional condition and thus, were not violative of plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.  981 F. Supp. 1288.</P>
<P>  State's motion for a preliminary injunction granted, where State sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendants from taking any further steps to implement termination agreement and close newspaper, and defendants claimed, among other things, that any injunctive relief would necessarily violate their First Amendment rights to refrain from speaking or publishing.  99 F.

<P>  Factors used to determine whether news reporter must reveal sources in libel action.  507 F. Supp. 880.</P>
<P>  Freedom of press guarantee is not sufficient in itself to protect reporter from being compelled to disclose confidential news source.  45 H. 317, 367 P.2d 472.</P>

<B><P>Right of privacy.</P>
</B><P>  Where plaintiff failed to show sufficient likelihood that state child protective services agency would violate plaintiff's privacy rights in the future, plaintiff lacked standing to seek injunctive relief against agency.  68 F.3d 331.</P>
<P>  Sex education film series shown to 5th and 6th grades with excusal system which permitted parents to have their children excused from viewing films did not contravene parents' right of privacy.  52 H. 436, 478 P.2d 314.</P>

</B><P>  Does not prevent defendant's exclusion from military base after being barred.  472 U.S. 675.</P>

<P>  Plaintiffs' free speech claim rejected, where plaintiffs argued that  Hawaii's policy of putting all questions on the same physical ballot, when combined with Hawai'i State AFL-CIO v.

<P>  Violated by city ordinance purporting to prohibit outdoor political signs on private and public property.  762 F. Supp. 280.</P>
<P>  Rule 3.5(b) of Hawaii rules of professional conduct unconstitutional, where, inter alia, language of rule 3.5(b) prohibiting ex parte communication with jurors "except as permitted by law" was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  916 F. Supp. 1525.</P>
<P>  Statements in editorial about plaintiff (when plaintiff was mayor) were protected by First Amendment and thus, not actionable.  930 F. Supp. 1403.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiffs filed motion for preliminary injunction regarding Act 359 of 1993 Hawaii legislature (relating to Hawaiian sovereignty), as amended in 1994 and 1996, plaintiffs unlikely to prevail on First Amendment claims as to native Hawaiian vote.  941 F. Supp. 1529.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff (who previously held a position at correctional facility), was not entitled to First Amendment protection, where plaintiff's repeated grievances and complaints regarding plaintiff's lack of safety at correctional facility, i.e., plaintiff's requests for a personal security guard, did not substantially involve matters of public concern.  25 F. Supp. 2d 1124.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff-physician claimed that plaintiff had been illegally harassed and retaliated against by the defendants who acted as part of an illegal conspiracy against plaintiff and that all of the defendants' actions constituted retaliation against plaintiff for exercising plaintiff's First Amendment right to speak out about inmate abuse at correctional facility, defendants, among other things, engaged in a conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of constitutionally protected rights to free speech in violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983.  99 F. Supp. 2d 1216.</P>
<P>  Where defendants argued that plaintiff waived constitutional right to free speech by voluntarily signing Code of Fair Campaign Practices (Code), plaintiff did not waive ability to assert First Amendment rights; campaign spending commission's (commission) administrative decision did not have preclusive effect on the court proceeding; Code unconstitutionally burdened protected speech; commission's censure of plaintiff violated plaintiff's First Amendment rights to free speech.  135 F. Supp. 2d 1114.</P>
<P>  In lawsuit involving a challenge to city and county of Honolulu's practice of charging nonresidents a $3.00 fee to enter bay designated a marine life conservation district and nature preserve, plaintiff's First Amendment rights not violated and ordinance instituting the fee not overbroad.  215 F. Supp. 2d 1098.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff maintained that defendant union provided inadequate information to nonmembers prior to making union payroll deductions pursuant to §89-4, in violation of Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson.  Defendants were preliminarily enjoined from taking any action to demand and/or collect from plaintiff and class members, by any means, agency fees and from taking any other action to enforce §89-4(a), until a mechanism for withdrawing agency fees that was in compliance with Hudson was devised and approved, where plaintiff alleged, among other things, irreparable injury by arguing that any violation of Hudson notice requirements infringed upon plaintiff's First Amendment rights.  269 F. Supp. 2d 1252.</P>
<P>  Plaintiffs asserted that an ordinance preventing them from flying their aerial tow banners over the city's beaches violated their rights under the First Amendment; the ordinance was a reasonable, viewpoint neutral restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum.  345 F. Supp. 2d 1123.</P>
<P>  Right to receive information and ideas not infringed by statutes proscribing possession of marijuana.  56 H. 501, 542 P.2d 366.</P>

<P>  Ordinance prohibiting distribution of commercial handbills in Waikiki impermissibly regulated commercial speech.  64 H. 148, 637 P.2d 1117.</P>
<P>  Peddling ordinance unduly restricted commercial speech.  64 H. 499, 643 P.2d 1058.</P>
<P>  Attorneys' extrajudicial statements may be subject to prior restraint by trial court upon demonstration that the activity restrained poses a serious and imminent threat to defendant's right to a fair trial and to the fair administration of justice.  73 H. 499, 835 P.2d 637.</P>
<P>  Section 707-716 not unconstitutional where threats sufficiently unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution.  75 H. 398, 862 P.2d 1063.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff was removed from project, State did not violate the Hawai'i Whistleblowers' Protection Act or the First Amendment when it reassigned the project to someone else.  76 H. 332, 876 P.2d 1300.</P>
<P>  Defendant's statement not false or defamatory where statement was rhetorical hyperbole--figurative or hyperbolic language that would negate the impression that defendant was asserting an objective fact about plaintiff.  88 H. 94, 962 P.2d 353.</P>
<P>  Neither the free speech clause of the U.S. Constitution nor that of the Hawaii constitution impose a temporal "immediacy" requirement that must be met before words become subject to criminal prosecution as "true threats" under §§707-715 and 707-716.  95 H. 465, 24 P.3d 661.</P>
<P>  Where student manager was a public agent of the university and manager did not identify any matter of public concern addressed by manager's racial slur directed at complainant or accompanying threatening statements, manager's speech was not protected speech.  102 H. 307, 76 P.3d 550.</P>
<P>  Section 852-1 not unconstitutional as it does not prohibit picketing or the communication of messages altogether, is specifically aimed at conduct causing an obstruction of ingress to or egress from public or private places, and individuals may continue to exercise rights guaranteed by the First Amendment and article I, §4 of the Hawaii constitution as long as they do not do so in a manner prohibited by section.  89 H. 27 (App.), 968 P.2d 194.</P>
<P>  Defendant's continuing physical obstruction of the lawful work by the Hawaii county department of water supply on Hawaiian home lands property constituted conduct clearly outside the scope of any First Amendment right to freedom of speech.  105 H. 319 (App.), 97 P.3d 395.</P>
