The governor may prescribe their organization, functions and authority.  A temporary board or commission shall not remain in existence for a term extending beyond the last day of the second regular session of the legislature after the date of its establishment or beyond the period required to receive federal grants-in-aid, whichever occurs later, unless extended by concurrent resolution of the legislature.</P>
<P>&#9;All members of temporary boards and commissions shall serve without pay, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for necessary expenses while attending meetings and while in the discharge of duties and responsibilities.  The reimbursement for expenses shall be made from the governor's contingent fund. [L Sp 1959 2d, c 1, §30; Supp, §14A-29; HRS §26-41; gen ch 1985]</P>
