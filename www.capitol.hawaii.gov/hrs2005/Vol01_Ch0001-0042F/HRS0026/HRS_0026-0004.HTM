</B>
<P>  The office of the governor is a constitutional office established by §1 of article V of the state constitution and is not a principal department of the state executive branch listed in this section; thus, any agency that is not temporary and for special purposes cannot be validly placed within the office of the governor.  Att. Gen Op. 96-1.</P>

<P>  Presumption of constitutionality applies to policies set by state agencies.  56 H. 601, 546 P.2d 1005.</P>
