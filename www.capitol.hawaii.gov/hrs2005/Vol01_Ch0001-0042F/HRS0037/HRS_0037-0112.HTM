The legislature shall consider these estimates in appropriating funds and enacting revenue measures.  The governor and legislature shall use the latest council estimate as the base estimate against which their revenue estimates shall be compared.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  All estimates submitted by the council shall be made public.  If the legislature in appropriating funds, or if the governor in preparing the budget uses a revenue estimate which differs from the estimate prepared by the council, then the governor or the legislature shall make that fact public together with reasons for using the differing revenue estimates.
