No suit or prosecution, pending at the time this chapter takes effect, shall be affected by this chapter.  The right of any administrative officer of the county to institute proceedings for prosecution for an offense or any action to recover a penalty or forfeiture shall henceforth be vested in the head of the state department to which the function has been assigned by the governor or some person designated by the head of the department or the governor or as may be otherwise directed by law.</P>
<P>&#9;The right of appeal from administrative actions or determinations as provided by law shall not be impaired by this chapter.</P>
