The governor may extend the same as the governor may deem advisable.  The proclamation of bank holidays shall not relate to any business other than that of banking and kindred operations, nor as prohibiting, perforce, any voluntary conduct of banking business, in whole or in part, except to the extent declared in the proclamation or in any further proclamation in enlargement or modification thereof.
