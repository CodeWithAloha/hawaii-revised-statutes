<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§99. </B> That the portion of the public domain heretofore known as Crown land is hereby declared to have been, on the twelfth day of August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and prior thereto, the property of the Hawaiian government, and to be free and clear from any trust of or concerning the same, and from all claim of any nature whatsoever, upon the rents, issues, and profits thereof.  It shall be subject to alienation and other uses as may be provided by law.</P>

<P>  Compare Const. of 1894, Art. 95.  In view of this §, the title of the government to crown lands cannot be questioned by the courts:  18 H. 645; 18 H. 651; 20 H. 548.  When monarchy ceased, crown lands became part of the public domain, irrespective of this § or the corresponding § of the Const. of 1894, and no equitable interest remained in retiring queen:  45 C. Cls. R. 418; if there were any trust it was denied by this §, and the statute of limitations (six years) began to run:  Id.  Referred to in 16 H. 245.  See note to §73.</P>
