<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§100. </B> All records relating to naturalization, all declarations of intention to become citizens of the United States, and all certificates of naturalization filed, recorded, or issued prior to the taking effect of the naturalization Act of June twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred and six, in or from any circuit court of the Territory of Hawaii, shall for all purposes be deemed to be and to have been made, filed, recorded, or issued by a court with jurisdiction to naturalize aliens, but shall not be by this Act further validated or legalized. [Am May<B>&nbsp;</B>27, 1910, c 258, §9, 36 Stat 443; Oct.<B>&nbsp;</B>14, 1940, c 876, §504, 54 Stat 1137, 1172]</P>

<P>  Territorial circuit courts were held to have jurisdiction to naturalize even before the general naturalization act of June&nbsp;26, 1906, which clearly conferred such jurisdiction:  17 H. 295; 211 U.S. 146.  The first paragraph of this § as originally enacted (see RLH 1935) may have been unconstitutional because not "an uniform rule:"  162 Fed. 470; it has been repealed by implication by the general naturalization act above referred to:  Id, overruling 3 U.S.D.C. Haw. 191, and it was specifically repealed Oct.&nbsp;14, 1940.  Referred to in 13 H. 21.  See §4 and note thereto; also citizenship and immigration cases in note to RLH 1955, §57-43.</P>
<P>  Certificates of naturalization granted by the U.S. District Court for Hawaii between January&nbsp;1, 1919 and July&nbsp;1, 1922, validated "insofar as failure of the record to contain final order under the hand of the court is concerned" by the Act of June&nbsp;29, 1938, c 822, 52 Stat 1249.  Referred to in 236 F.2d 622.</P>
