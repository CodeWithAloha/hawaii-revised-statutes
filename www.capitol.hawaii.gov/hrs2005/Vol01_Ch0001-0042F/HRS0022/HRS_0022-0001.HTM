<P>  Senate rule 31(3), which allows a majority of the members of the senate to convene a meeting of the senate "at any time for the purpose of carrying out the Senate's responsibilities under Article III, Section 12, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii", does not violate this section, because the rule merely establishes a portion of the process members must follow to terminate or choose their officers.  Att. Gen. Op. 05-1.</P>
