<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§39-70 </B> <B>Bond anticipation notes. </B> In anticipation of the issuance of revenue bonds pursuant to this part theretofore authorized by the legislature for an undertaking or a loan program and of the receipt of the proceeds of such revenue bonds, the department having jurisdiction over the undertaking or a loan program, with the approval of the governor, may issue and sell revenue bond anticipation notes for the purposes for which the revenue bonds have been authorized, the maximum principal amount of which shall not exceed the authorized principal amount of the revenue bonds.  The notes shall be payable solely from and secured by the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds in anticipation of which they were issued and the revenue, or the user taxes, or a combination of both, which would be payable from and secured by the revenue bonds; provided that to the extent the principal of the notes is paid from moneys other than the proceeds of sale of the revenue bonds, the maximum amount of revenue bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued that has been authorized shall be reduced by the amount of the notes paid.  The issuance of notes and the details thereof shall be governed by this part with respect to revenue bonds insofar as it may apply; provided that each note, together with all renewals and extensions thereof or refundings thereof by other notes issued pursuant to this section, shall mature within five years from the date of the original note. [L 1988, c 28, pt of §3]</P>
