In addition, fully registered revenue bonds may be authenticated with the manual signature of the registrar, if any, thereunto duly appointed by the director of finance.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the department head or a deputy department head designated by the department head, with the approval of the governor, may provide that revenue bonds issued pursuant to this part may be typewritten, printed, or otherwise reproduced, and that the signature of the director of finance upon the revenue bonds may be the director of finance's manual signature.  The coupons pertaining to the revenue bonds shall be executed with the lithographed or engraved facsimile signatures of the department head and the director of finance.  In the case of a department having a governing body, for purposes of this section, the member who is the presiding officer or, if authorized by the governing body, the executive director or other officer of the board, commission, agency, authority or public corporation, instrumentality, or other body shall be deemed the department head.  Pending the preparation of the definitive revenue bonds, interim receipts or certificates in such form and with such provisions as the department head or governing body may decide upon, may be issued to the purchaser or purchasers of revenue bonds sold pursuant to this part.
