<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§10-28]  Validity of bonds.</B>  Revenue bonds issued under this part shall bear the signatures of the chairperson of the board and the administrator, either of which signatures may be a lithographed or engraved facsimile of the signature provided that at least one of the signatures is a manual signature, and shall be sealed with the seal of the board or in lieu thereof shall bear a lithographed or engraved facsimile of such seal.  The coupons pertaining to the revenue bonds shall be executed with the lithographed or engraved facsimile signatures of the chairperson of the board and the administrator.  Revenue bonds bearing the signature of officers in office at the date of the signing thereof shall be valid and binding obligations, notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof and payment therefor any or all of the persons whose signatures appear thereon shall have ceased to be officers.  The validity of the bonds shall not be dependent on nor affected by the validity or regularity of any proceedings relating to the construction or maintenance of the office project or projects for which the bonds were issued.  The resolution authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds may provide that the bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this part, which recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance.
