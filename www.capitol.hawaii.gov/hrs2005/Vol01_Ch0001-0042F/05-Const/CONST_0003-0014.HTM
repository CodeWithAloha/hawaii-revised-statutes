</B>
<P>  For annotations relating to similar provisions of prior law, see notes to Organic Act, §45.</P>
<P>  Provision pertaining to subject is to be liberally construed.  58 H. 25, 564 P.2d 135.</P>
<P>  Purposes of one-subject requirement are to prevent logrolling legislation, to prevent surprise or fraud upon the legislature, to apprise the people.  58 H. 25, 564 P.2d 135.</P>
<P>  Section is mandatory and a violation would render an enactment nugatory, but an enactment is presumptively constitutional.  58 H. 25, 564 P.2d 135.</P>
<P>  Prohibition against legislation with more than one subject does not apply to constitutional amendments.  60 H. 324, 590 P.2d 543.</P>
<P>  This article and article XVII of the Hawaii constitution require that (1) a proposal to amend the constitution must be reflected in the title of the bill and (2) a proposed constitutional amendment must be read three times in each house to be validly adopted; where Act 60, L 2004, violated these requirements, Act was not validly adopted.  ___ H. ___ (No. 26962).</P>
<P>  Cited:  48 H. 152, 160, 397 P.2d 593; 53 H. 327, 493 P.2d 306.</P>
