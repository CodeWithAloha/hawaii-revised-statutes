<P>  A voter must qualify as a Hawaiian in his or her own right, not on the basis of the racial descent of the adoptive parents.  Att. Gen. Op. 80-6.</P>
<P>  The requirement that trustees be Hawaiians is not violative of the equal protection clauses; also the restriction to Hawaiians of the right to vote for trustees is not impermissible.  Att. Gen. Op. 80-8.</P>

</B>
<P>  State's electoral restriction enacted a race-based voting qualification; Hawaii's denial of petitioner's right to vote, where petitioner was not a "Hawaiian", was a clear violation of the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  528 U.S. 495.</P>
<P>  Does not violate section 5 of the Admission Act.  921 F.2d 950.</P>
<P>  Limitation of eligibility to be a candidate for office of Hawaiian affairs trustee to Hawaiians invalid under the Fifteenth Amendment and §2 of the Voting Rights Act; plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the restriction that appointed trustees be Hawaiian.  314 F.3d 1091.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff challenging constitutionality of article XII, §§5 and 6 of state constitution and chapter 10, lacked standing, where plaintiff had not suffered any injury-in-fact.  188 F. Supp. 2d 1233.</P>
