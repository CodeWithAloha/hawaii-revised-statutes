<P>  This article, entitled "Code of Ethics," is new, added by Const Con 1978 and election Nov 7, 1978.  The former Article XIV, entitled "General and Miscellaneous Provisions," now appears as Article XVI.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;The people of Hawaii believe that public officers and employees must exhibit the highest standards of ethical conduct and that these standards come from the personal integrity of each individual in government.  To keep faith with this belief, the legislature, each political subdivision and the constitutional convention shall adopt a code of ethics which shall apply to appointed and elected officers and employees of the State or the political subdivision, respectively, including members of the boards, commissions and other bodies.</P>
<P>&#9;Each code of ethics shall be administered by a separate ethics commission, except the code of ethics adopted by the constitutional convention which shall be administered by the state ethics commission.  The members of ethics commissions shall be prohibited from taking an active part in political management or in political campaigns.  Ethics commissioners shall be selected in a manner which assures their independence and impartiality.</P>
<P>&#9;Each code of ethics shall include, but not be limited to, provisions on gifts, confidential information, use of position, contracts with government agencies, post-employment, financial disclosure and lobbyist registration and restriction.  The financial disclosure provisions shall require all elected officers, all candidates for elective office and such appointed officers and employees as provided by law to make public financial disclosures.  Other public officials having significant discretionary or fiscal powers as provided by law shall make confidential financial disclosures.  All financial disclosure statements shall include, but not be limited to, sources and amounts of income, business ownership, officer and director positions, ownership of real property, debts, creditor interests in insolvent businesses and the names of persons represented before government agencies. [Add Const Con 1978 and election Nov&nbsp;7, 1978]</P>
