<P>&#9;<B>Section 7.</B>  There shall be established by law a council on revenues which shall prepare revenue estimates of the state government and shall report the estimates to the governor and the legislature at times provided by law.  The estimates shall be considered by the governor in preparing the budget, recommending appropriations and revenues and controlling expenditures.  The estimates shall be considered by the legislature in appropriating funds and enacting revenue measures.  All revenue estimates submitted by the council to the governor and the legislature shall be made public.  If the legislature in appropriating funds or if the governor in preparing the budget or recommending appropriations exceeds estimated revenues due to proposed expenditures, this fact shall be made public including the reasons therefor.
