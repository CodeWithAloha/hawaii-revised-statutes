<P>  This is the former section 5 of the old Article X.  A proposal of the 1978 Constitutional Convention deleting this provision from the Constitution was not validly ratified.  Kahalekai v. Doi, 60 H. 324 (1979).  In view of the holding, the revisor has restored the provision and designated it as section 10 of this article under the authority of Resolution No. 29 of the 1978 Constitutional Convention.</P>
