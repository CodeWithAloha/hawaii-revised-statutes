<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Executing a writing authorizing another person or persons to act as a proxy for the member, which may be accomplished by the member or the member's authorized attorney-in-fact, officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing the member's signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means, including without limitation the use of a facsimile signature; or</P>

<P>&#9;(c)  An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest.  Appointments coupled with an interest without limitation include the appointment of:</P><DIR>
