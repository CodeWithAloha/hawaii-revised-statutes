<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Causes an appropriate certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or certificate of correction to be signed and delivered to the director for filing; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Withdraws from future participation as an owner in the enterprise by signing and delivering to the director for filing a statement of withdrawal under this section.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  A person that makes an investment described in subsection (a) shall be liable to the same extent as a general partner to any third party that enters into a transaction with the enterprise, believing in good faith that the person is a general partner, before a statement of withdrawal, certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or certificate of correction is filed with the director to show that the person is not a general partner.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If a person makes a diligent effort in good faith to comply with subsection (a)(1) and is unable to cause the appropriate certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or certificate of correction to be signed and delivered to the director for filing, the person has the right to withdraw from the enterprise pursuant to subsection (a)(2) even if the withdrawal would otherwise breach an agreement with others that are or have agreed to become co-owners of the enterprise.
