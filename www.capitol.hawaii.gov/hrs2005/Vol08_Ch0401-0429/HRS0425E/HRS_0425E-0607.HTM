<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;[§425E-</B><STRONG>607]  Liability to other persons of person dissociated as a general partner.  </STRONG>(a)  A person's dissociation as a general partner shall not of itself discharge the person's liability as a general partner for an obligation of the limited partnership incurred before dissociation.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), the person shall not be liable for a limited partnership's obligation incurred after dissociation.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  A person whose dissociation as a general partner resulted in a dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership's activities shall be liable to the same extent as a general partner under section 425E-404 on an obligation incurred by the limited partnership under section 425E-804.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A person that has dissociated as a general partner but whose dissociation did not result in a dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership's activities shall be liable on a transaction entered into by the limited partnership after the dissociation only if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A general partner would be liable on the transaction; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;At the time the other party enters into the transaction:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Less than two years has passed since the dissociation; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The other party does not have notice of the dissociation and reasonably believes that the person is a general partner.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  By agreement with a creditor of a limited partnership and the limited partnership, a person dissociated as a general partner may be released from liability for an obligation of the limited partnership.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  A person dissociated as a general partner shall be released from liability for an obligation of the limited partnership if the limited partnership's creditor, with notice of the person's dissociation as a general partner but without the person's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of the obligation.
