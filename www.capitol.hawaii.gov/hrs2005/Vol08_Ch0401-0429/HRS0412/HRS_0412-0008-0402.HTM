<P>&#9;(b)  A trust company may establish one or more common trust funds for the collective investment and reinvestment of moneys contributed thereto by it as fiduciary, and by it and others as co-fiduciaries; and the trust company and its co-fiduciaries may invest funds held as trustee, guardian, or in any other fiduciary capacity in which it or they shall be authorized to invest funds, in any common trust fund, if the investment is not expressly forbidden by the instrument, decree, or order creating the fiduciary relationship.  Common trust funds may be invested and reinvested in those investments in which trust companies are authorized to invest trust funds.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations or court decisions governing common trust funds of national banking associations, as they may be amended from time to time, shall also govern common trust funds of a trust company. [L 1993, c 350, pt of §1]</P>
