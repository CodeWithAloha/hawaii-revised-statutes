<P>&#9;(b)  Articles of dissolution, articles of conversion, and articles of merger or share exchange may specify a delayed effective time and date, and if it does so the document becomes effective at the time and date specified.

A delayed effective date for a document may not be later than the thirtieth day after the date it is filed. [L 2000, c 244, pt of §1; am L 2001, c 129, §11; am L 2002, c 130, §9]</P>
