<P>&#9;(b)  If the foreign corporation does not correct each ground for revocation or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the department director that each ground determined by the department director does not exist within sixty days after the date of mailing of the department director's written notice, the department director may revoke the foreign corporation's certificate of authority by signing a certificate of revocation that recites the ground or grounds for revocation and its effective date.</P>
