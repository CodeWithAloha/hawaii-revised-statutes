The action shall be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action taken, given either in writing and signed before or after the intended effective date of the action by each director, or by electronic transmission, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.  In the case of a consent by electronic transmission, the electronic transmission shall set forth or be submitted with information from which it may be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the director who sent the electronic transmission.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Action taken under this section shall be effective when the last director signs the consent or gives a consent by electronic transmission, unless the consent specifies a different effective date.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A consent signed or given by electronic transmission under this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. [L 2000, c 244, pt of §1; am L 2002, c 130, §22]</P>
