<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§634J-2]  Motion for order requiring plaintiff to post security.</B>  In any litigation pending in any court of this State, at any time until final judgment is entered, a defendant may move the court, upon notice and hearing, for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish security.  The motion must be based upon the ground, and supported by a showing, that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and that there is no reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail in the litigation against the moving defendant. [L 1993, c 124, pt of §1]</P>
