<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Have a governing board whose members have no material conflict of interest and serve without compensation;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Have bylaws or policies that describe the manner in which business is conducted, and policies that relate to nepotism and management of potential conflict of interest situations;</P>
