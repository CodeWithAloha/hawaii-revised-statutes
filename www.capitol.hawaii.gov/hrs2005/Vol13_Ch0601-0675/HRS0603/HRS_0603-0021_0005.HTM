<P>  Where Congress has not expressly set out exclusive jurisdiction, state courts are competent to decide federal claims.  437 F. Supp. 368.</P>
<P>  Where plea of not guilty and demand for jury trial by defendant charged with a misdemeanor conferred jurisdiction on circuit court, withdrawal of such plea and of demand for jury trial does not divest circuit court of jurisdiction.  55 H. 394, 520 P.2d 427.</P>
<P>  Although misdemeanors are normally tried in district court, such offenses are within jurisdiction of circuit court.  59 H. 92, 576 P.2d 1044.</P>
<P>  Court has jurisdiction over all civil causes of action unless precluded by state constitution or statute.  63 H. 55, 621 P.2d 346.</P>
<P>  Regardless of whether a jury trial is demanded, circuit court may properly exercise jurisdiction over DUI cases; both the circuit and district courts have concurrent jurisdiction over DUI cases.  78 H. 367, 893 P.2d 795.</P>
<P>  Circuit court had jurisdiction under this section to consider attorney general's request for declaratory judgment and related injunctions regarding proposed constitutional amendments where not precluded by Hawaii constitution or other statute.  84 H. 179, 932 P.2d 316.</P>
<P>  Circuit court was statutorily authorized, in aid of its original jurisdiction over mortgage foreclosure actions, to enter appropriate orders against successful bidder at a judicial foreclosure sale after successful bidder defaulted on agreement to purchase the mortgaged property at the foreclosure sale.  96 H. 348 (App.), 31 P.3d 205.</P>
<P>  Relevant statutes, rules, and precedent did not permit wife to directly attack in circuit court the validity of the property and distribution part of the divorce decree; circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to do what wife must have had done to obtain the relief wife sought; pursuant to §§580-1 and 580-47, only the family court could have granted that relief.  101 H. 370 (App.), 68 P.3d 644.</P>
