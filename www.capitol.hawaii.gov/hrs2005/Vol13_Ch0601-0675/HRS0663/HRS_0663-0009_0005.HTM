<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§663-9.5]  Liability of firearm owners.</B>  The owner of a firearm, if the discharge of the firearm proximately causes either personal injury or property damage to any person, shall be absolutely liable for such damage.  It shall be an affirmative defense to such absolute liability that the firearm was not in the possession of the owner and was taken from the owner's possession without the owner's permission and the owner either had reported the theft to the police prior to the discharge or, despite the exercise of reasonable care, had not discovered the theft prior to the discharge or was not reasonably able to report the theft to the police prior to the discharge.  This section shall not apply when the discharge of the firearm was legally justified. [L 1994, c 204, §1]</P>
