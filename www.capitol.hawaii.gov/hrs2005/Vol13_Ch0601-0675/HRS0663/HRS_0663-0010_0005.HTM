<P>&#9;For purposes of this section, "government entity" means any unit of government in this State, including the State and any county or combination of counties, department, agency, institution, board, commission, district, council, bureau, office, governing authority, or other instrumentality of state or county government, or corporation or other establishment owned, operated, or managed by or on behalf of this State or any county.</P>
<P>&#9;For purposes of this section, the liability of a government entity shall include its vicarious liability for the acts or omissions of its officers and employees.<B> </B>[L 1994, c 213, §1; am L 2001, c 300, §2]</P>

<P>  Applies only to causes of action based upon acts or omissions occurring on or after June 22, 1994.  L 1994, c 213, §3.</P>

</B>
<P>  The plain language of this section's nonretroactivity clause focuses upon the specific "acts or omissions" that predicate a plaintiff's claim, and, therefore, the clause's applicability is not keyed to when the plaintiff's cause of action "accrues"; thus, trial court erred in apportioning liability between department of education (DOE) and teacher and DOE was liable to plaintiffs for the full extent of their damages.  100 H. 34, 58 P.3d 545.</P>
