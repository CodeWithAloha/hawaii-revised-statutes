</B>
<P>  "One joint tortfeasor" includes "joint tortfeasors", and "release" includes "releases"; individual releases of joint tortfeasors treated collectively to reduce claim by greater of total paid for releases or by what releases provided claim should be reduced.  67 H. 157, 683 P.2d 389.</P>
<P>  Judgment reduced by amount codefendant paid in settlement of claim, though at trial codefendant held not liable.  68 H. 472, 718 P.2d 1080.</P>
<P>  "So provides" language of this section means that a release discharges only those parties designated by name or otherwise specifically identified or described on the face of the release. 78 H. 1, 889 P.2d 685.</P>
<P>  Court erred in failing to give joint tortfeasor manufacturer credit, under this section and release agreement between employer and plaintiff employee, for sums paid by joint tortfeasor employer to plaintiff employee in excess of employer's share of jury verdict.  85 H. 336, 944 P.2d 1279.</P>
