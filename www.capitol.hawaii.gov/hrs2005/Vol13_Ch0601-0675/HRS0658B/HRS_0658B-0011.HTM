<P>&#9;(b)  The party seeking the process, costs, bond, or other undertaking must compute the dollar amount of the foreign money claimed from a bank-offered spot rate of exchange prevailing at or near the close of business on the banking day next preceding the filing of a request or application for the issuance of process or for the determination of costs, or an application for a bond or other court-required undertaking.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The party seeking the process, costs, bond, or other undertaking shall file with each request or application an affidavit or certificate executed in good faith by its counsel or a bank officer, stating the market quotation used, how obtained, and setting forth the calculation.  Affected court officials incur no liability, after a filing of the affidavit or certificate, for acting as if the judgment was in the amount of United States dollars stated in the affidavit or certificate.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Computations under this section are for the limited purposes of the section and do not affect computation of the United States dollar equivalent of the money of the judgment for payment purposes. [L 1990, c 50, pt of §1]</P>
