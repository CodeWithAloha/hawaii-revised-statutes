The court may refuse to grant leave unless the court finds that the ability of the obligor to comply with the terms of the obligation is not materially affected by reason of the obligor's military service.  For the purpose of this subsection, premiums which are guaranteed under part IV shall not be deemed to be due and unpaid.</P>

The court, after a hearing on an application by the person in military service or some person on behalf of the person in military service, unless in the opinion of the court the ability of the defendant to pay the storage charges due is not materially affected by reason of the person's military service, may find against a person in military service.</P>
