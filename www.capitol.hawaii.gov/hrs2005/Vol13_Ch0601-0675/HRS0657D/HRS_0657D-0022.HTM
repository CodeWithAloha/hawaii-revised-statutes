<P>&#9;(b)  Any person who knowingly resumes possession of property that is the subject of this section otherwise than as provided in subsection (a) or in section 657D-6 or attempts so to do, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Upon the hearing of that action the court may order the repayment of prior installments or deposits or any part thereof, as a condition of terminating the contract and resuming possession of the property, or on its own motion or on application to it by the person in military service or a person on behalf of such person, shall order a stay of proceedings as provided in this chapter unless, in the opinion of the court, the ability of the defendant to comply with the terms of the contract is not materially affected by reason of that service; or it may make such other disposition of the case as may be equitable to preserve the interests of all parties.
