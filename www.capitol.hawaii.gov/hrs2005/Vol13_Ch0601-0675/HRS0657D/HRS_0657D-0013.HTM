<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§657D-13]</B>  <B>Fines and penalties on contracts. </B> When an action for compliance with the terms of any contract is stayed pursuant to this chapter, no fine or penalty shall accrue by reason of failure to comply with the terms of the contract during the period of the stay.  In any case where a person fails to perform any obligation and a fine or penalty for the nonperformance is incurred, a court may relieve the enforcement of the fine or penalty on such terms as may be just if the person was in the military service when the penalty was incurred and that by reason of that service the ability of the person to pay or perform was thereby materially impaired. [L 1994, c 257, pt of §2]</P>
