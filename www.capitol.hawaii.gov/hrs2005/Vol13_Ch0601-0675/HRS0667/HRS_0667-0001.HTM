<P>  The judicial foreclosure system in Hawaii, pursuant to this section, is not clearly, manifestly and unmistakably violative of due process; considering the two basic elements of procedural due process--notice and the opportunity to be heard--appellants were afforded due process.  94 H. 422 (App.), 16 P.3d 827.</P>
