<P>  Laches is not imputable to one mentally incapacitated to execute valid deed.  31 H. 817.</P>
<P>  Amendment reducing period of infancy, during which statute of limitations is tolled, from 20 to 18 years had effect of accelerating the date on which the limitation statute commences to run so that action not brought within two years after plaintiff had reached 18 was barred.  58 H. 101, 564 P.2d 1276.</P>
<P>  Section applies to the limitations period provided in §663-3.  63 H. 273, 626 P.2d 182.</P>
<P>  Not applicable to actions against the State.  72 H. 77, 806 P.2d 957.</P>

<P>  Considering the definition of insanity and construing summary judgment liberally in favor of non-movant, affidavits of doctors that patient was mentally incompetent to manage patient's legal and business affairs were sufficient to invoke tolling provisions of this section.  89 H. 244, 971 P.2d 717.</P>
<P>  Because the city is neither the sovereign nor the surrogate or alter ego of the sovereign, it is not entitled to sovereign immunity; thus, it is subject to the State's tort laws in the same manner as any private tortfeasor; as this section governs classes of "personal" tort actions, such as "damage to persons or property," the infancy tolling provision of paragraph (1) applies directly to personal injury actions against the city; child was thus able to bring action, but as paragraph (1) did not provide for tolling of parents' derivative actions and they did not timely comply with §46-72, their individual claims were barred.  104 H. 341, 90 P.3d 233.</P>
<P>  Cited:  20 H. 165; 75 F. Supp. 553, 563; 198 F. Supp. 78, 91.</P>
