</B>
<P>  Where plaintiffs never had original complaint, the only complaint filed within limitations period, served on defendant and had only the first amended complaint served, despite the fact that original complaint was never served, actions by plaintiffs evidenced both an intent to serve original complaint as well as a continuing intent to pursue their cause of action.   848 F. Supp. 1482.</P>
