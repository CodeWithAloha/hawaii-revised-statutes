If the bond is not given after twenty-four hours' notice in writing from the officer to the plaintiff, the plaintiff's agent, or attorney, if it is required, the officer may refuse to levy, or, having levied, may dismiss the levy.  If the required bond is given, the officer shall seize and sell or dispose of the property according to the command of the process in the officer's hands.
