<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>Rule 806  Attacking and supporting credibility of declarant.</B>  When a hearsay statement has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.  Evidence of a statement or conduct by the declarant at any time, inconsistent with the declarant's hearsay statement, is not subject to any requirement that the declarant may have been afforded an opportunity to deny or explain.  If the party against whom a hearsay statement has been admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party is entitled to examine the declarant on the statement as if under cross-examination. [L 1980, c 164, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]</P>

<B><P>  </B>This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 806 except that the phrase, "or a statement defined in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E)," is omitted as superfluous, inasmuch as these categories of party-opponent admissions are treated in these rules as hearsay exceptions under Rule 803(a) supra.  As the Advisory Committee's Note to Fed. R. Evid. 806 puts it:  "The declarant of a hearsay statement which is admitted in evidence is in effect a witness.  His credibility should in fairness be subject to impeachment and support as though he had in fact testified."</P>
