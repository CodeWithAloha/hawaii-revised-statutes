<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 1004 COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is similar to Fed. R. Evid. 1004, except that the words "or a duplicate" are added to the first sentence of this rule.  The change is not substantive.  The rule specifies the exceptions to Rule 1002, and effects no change in existing law, see Chu Chung v. Jellings, 30 H. 784 (1929) (destroyed); Rex v. Lenehan, 3 H. 714 (1876) (possession of opponent).</P>
<P>  As the Advisory Committee's Note to Fed. R. Evid. 1004 points out, the "rule recognizes no 'degrees' of secondary evidence."  Thus, when this rule is satisfied, there is no preference for one form of secondary evidence over another.</P>
