If a copy which complies with the foregoing cannot be obtained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, then other evidence of the contents may be given. [L 1980, c 164, pt of §1]</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 1005 COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is similar to Fed. R. Evid. 1005 in intent.  The "public records" covered are those specified in Rule 1001(5) supra.  Since production of original public records would be burdensome to both proponents and public officials, numerous statutes, e.g., Hawaii Rev. Stat. §502-82 (1976) (recorded instruments of conveyance) dispense with such a requirement.  In this instance, however, a distinct preference for certified or compared copies is expressed.</P>

<P>  Redacted judgment of conviction properly authenticated and admitted under this rule where prosecution submitted certified copy of the full judgment for identification, along with redacted judgment, and witness identified defendant as person to whom redacted judgment referred to.  83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</P>
