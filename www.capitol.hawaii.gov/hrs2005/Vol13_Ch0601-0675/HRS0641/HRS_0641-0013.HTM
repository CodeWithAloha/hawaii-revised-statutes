<P>  L 2004, c 202, §82 provides:</P>
<P>  "SECTION 82.  Appeals pending in the supreme court as of the effective date of this Act [July 1, 2006] may be transferred to the intermediate appellate court or retained at the supreme court as the chief justice, in the chief justice's sole discretion, directs."</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">General Note</P>
</B>
<P>  Appeal, see Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure.  See also appended chapter note, pt. I A.</P>
<P>  Oral ruling of district magistrate constitutes an order within the meaning of this section.  41 H. 591.  But appeal by State from oral order of circuit court dismissing indictment is nugatory.  45 H. 501, 370 P.2d 480.</P>
<P>  Special plea in bar, sustaining of, what constitutes.  25 H. 55; 47 H. 361, 389 P.2d 439.  See 39 H. 522.</P>
<P>  No appeal by State from ruling on question of law unless defendant convicted and appeals.  34 H. 662.</P>
<P>  No right to review after acquittal of accused by verdict of jury.  42 H. 102.</P>
<P>  Remand after reversal of ruling sustaining demurrer.  23 H. 409.</P>
<P>  Under prior law sustaining of demurrer to indictment not appealable unless based on construction of statute or its invalidity.  21 H. 56, 57; 23 H. 546; 29 H. 827.</P>
<P>  Pretrial order to suppress evidence; "special plea in bar" construed.  50 H. 525, 445 P.2d 36.</P>
<P>  When State appeals from the quashing of an indictment, defendant is still subject to original requirements of bail.  53 H. 76, 488 P.2d 329.</P>
<P>  Cited:  37 H. 601, 603; 48 H. 247, 256, 397 P.2d 575.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Rules of Court</P>
</B>
<P>  Appeals, when taken, see HRAP rule 4.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Conditional discharge of defendant under section 712-1255 is not a final disposition of the case appealable by the State.  60 H. 576, 592 P.2d 832.</P>
<P>  Stipulation for joint hearing on motion to suppress and trial on merits is not a waiver by State of its right to appeal from ruling on motion to suppress.  62 H. 44, 609 P.2d 131.</P>
<P>  Under circumstances, jeopardy did not attach even though jury was sworn.  64 H. 395, 641 P.2d 1338.</P>
<P>  Jeopardy did not attach where case dismissed after defendant arraigned but before State's first witness sworn.  68 H. 238, 709 P.2d 607.</P>
<P>  State could appeal only under paragraph (2) where case dismissed after all evidence taken.  68 H. 653, 729 P.2d 385.</P>
<P>  Deferred acceptance of guilty and deferred acceptance of no contest pleas are not appealable.  69 H. 438, 746 P.2d 568.</P>
<P>  Authorizes appellate jurisdiction to review orders granting pretrial motions to suppress.  70 H. 206, 767 P.2d 1238.</P>
<P>  Language does not allow an appeal from a sentence on the ground that the sentence was imposed in an illegal manner, but allows an appeal from an illegal sentence.  71 H. 624, 801 P.2d 558.</P>
<P>  State's right to appeal in criminal cases is limited to instances stated in section; section does not give State right to appeal from granting of deferred acceptance of guilty or deferred acceptance of no contest pleas.  74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776.</P>
<P>  While it is necessary for "entire case" to be dismissed for paragraph (2) to apply, there is nothing in the language of this section to indicate that this would prevent paragraph (1) from applying; prosecution not barred from bringing appeal of dismissal of counts of indictment, where counts dismissed after trial began because counts did not include essential elements of offenses charged.  78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70.</P>
<P>  In a jury trial, issues decided by the judge are "questions of law" appealable under this section, while issues decided by the jury are "questions of fact" and are not appealable.  85 H. 462, 946 P.2d 32.</P>
<P>  As defendant's "motion to dismiss" following a jury verdict of guilty deemed post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal following a jury verdict of guilty pursuant to HRPP rule 29(c), paragraph (9) authorized prosecution to assert appeal from this judgment of acquittal; thus, supreme court had appellate jurisdiction over appeal.  87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865.</P>
<P>  Double jeopardy clauses not violated by prosecution's appeal from judgment of acquittal following jury's verdict of guilty pursuant to paragraph (9).  87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865.</P>
<P>  Paragraph (1) permits prosecution to appeal from both dismissals with prejudice and without prejudice.  87 H. 260, 953 P.2d 1358.</P>
<P>  Where trial court's order was an order of dismissal and not a judgment of acquittal, order was appealable under paragraph (1).  97 H. 505, 40 P.3d 907.</P>
<P>  Paragraph (7) authorizes the prosecution to appeal orders suppressing evidence as illegally obtained, the intent of the statute being to facilitate the administration of justice in criminal cases by allowing the prosecution to obtain a conclusive ruling on issues involving searches, seizures, and confessions via direct appeal.  104 H. 224, 87 P.3d 893.</P>
<P>  The language of paragraph (7), which allows the prosecution to appeal from "a pretrial order granting a motion for the suppression of evidence," includes within its scope the right to appeal from a trial court’s voluntariness determination mandated by §621-26.  104 H. 224, 87 P.3d 893.</P>
<P>  As district family court proceedings under §571-11(1) concerning juvenile law violators are considered to be noncriminal proceedings, prosecution's appeal of family court order was not authorized by paragraph (7).  104 H. 403, 91 P.3d 485.</P>
<P>  Deferred acceptance of no contest plea not appealable until no contest plea accepted.  5 H. App. 357, 692 P.2d 1171.</P>
<P>  Section is to be strictly construed.  7 H. App. 516, 782 P.2d 29.</P>
<P>  Paragraph (9) did not preclude appellate court's jurisdiction over State's appeal where trial court's judgment of acquittal was "in form only and not in substance"; trial court made no factual determination as to some or all of the elements charged, but grounded its ruling on the conclusion that the charges were defective as a matter of law.  88 H. 477 (App.), 967 P.2d 674.</P>
