If any of the twelve are challenged and set aside, the clerk shall continue to draw by lot from the box until twelve impartial jurors are obtained, who then shall be sworn as the jurors for the trial of the cause.  If so directed by the court, additional jurors shall be drawn and impaneled to sit as alternate jurors.</P>
