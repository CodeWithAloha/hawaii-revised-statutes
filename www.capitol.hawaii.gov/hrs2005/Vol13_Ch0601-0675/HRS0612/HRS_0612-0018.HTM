In no case shall the trial jurors be chosen other than by lot, nor shall the trial jury be selected from the jurors other than by lot in open court.  In selecting the trial jury there is no requirement that all the names ordered by a judge be exhausted before other names may be used in the drawing, and the names of jurors may be mixed with each other for the drawing.</P>
