<P>  Order excusing a juror from further duty is in the discretion of the court and cannot be reversed by mandamus.  13 H. 332; 21 H. 66.</P>
<P>  Where prospective juror was prosecutor currently employed by same office as prosecutor trying the defendant, court shall imply bias as a matter of law and dismiss prospective juror for cause.  86 H. 195, 948 P.2d 1036.</P>
<P>  Blood relationship between juror's and defendant's families was not "slight or trivial cause"; thus, it was within court's discretion to excuse juror for cause.  93 H. 344 (App.), 3 P.3d 510.</P>
