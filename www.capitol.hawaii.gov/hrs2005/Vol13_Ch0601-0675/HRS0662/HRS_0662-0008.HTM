<P>  Applicable to judgments against State; interest accrues from entry of final appellate judgment.  6 H. App. 70, 708 P.2d 829, aff'd, 68 H. 220, 708 P.2d 824.</P>
<P>  Trial court did not err in concluding that the State was immune from paying more than four per cent per annum post-judgment interest on the plaintiffs' damages; as State appealed from trial court's judgment and thus interest began to accrue "after the judgment on appeal", trial court did not err in concluding that post-judgment interest on the plaintiffs' damages began to accrue on that date.  105 H. 104, 94 P.3d 659.</P>
