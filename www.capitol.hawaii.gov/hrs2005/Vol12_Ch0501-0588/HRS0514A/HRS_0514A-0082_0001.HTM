<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§514A-82.1  Employees of condominiums; background check.</B>  The board of directors of an association of apartment owners or the manager of a condominium project, upon the written authorization of an applicant for employment as security guard or manager or for a position which would allow the employee access to the keys of or entry into the units in the condominium project or access to association funds, may conduct a background check on the applicant or direct another responsible party to conduct the check.  Before initiating or requesting a check, the board of directors or the manager shall first certify that the signature on the authorization is authentic and that the person is an applicant for such employment.  The background check, at a minimum, shall require the applicant to disclose whether the applicant has been convicted in any jurisdiction of a crime which would tend to indicate that the applicant may be unsuited for employment as a condominium employee with access to association funds or the keys of or entry into the units in the condominium project, and the judgment of conviction has not been vacated.  For the purpose of this section, the criminal history disclosure made by the applicant may be verified by the board of directors, manager, or other responsible party, if so directed by the board or the manager, by means of information obtained through the Hawaii criminal justice data center.  The applicant shall provide the Hawaii criminal justice data center with personal identifying information which shall include but not be limited to the applicant's name, social security number, date of birth, and gender.  This information shall be used only for the purpose of conducting the criminal history record check authorized by this section.  Failure of an association of apartment owners or the manager to conduct or verify or cause to have conducted or verified a background check shall not alone give rise to any private cause of action against an association or manager for acts and omissions of the employee hired. [L 1988, c 293, §1; am L 2003, c 95, §14]</P>
