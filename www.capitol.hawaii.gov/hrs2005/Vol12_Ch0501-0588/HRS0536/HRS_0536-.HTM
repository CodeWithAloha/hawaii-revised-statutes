<B><P>VI.  Construction. </P>
</B><P>  General rules:  True intent, as gathered from all parts of will, is of first importance.  3 H. 421, 443; 6 H. 8, 10; 6 H. 228; 8 H. 392, 401; 10 H. 543, 545; 11 H. 47, 51; 12 H. 104, 108, 117; 12 H. 375, 379; 13 H. 319; 18 H. 52, 70, aff'd 211 U.S. 321, 330; 21 H. 619, 622; 22 H. 233, 238-240; 22 H. 510, 513; 22 H. 644, 647; 25 H. 22, 30; 28 H. 590, reversed on other grounds 26 F.2d 609; 29 H. 474; 29 H. 854; 30 H. 246; 30 H. 217; 31 H. 92; 31 H. 535; 59 F.2d 681; 61 F.2d 598.  Extrinsic evidence of intention as an independent fact is inadmissible to supply any material provision or omission by mistake.  24 H. 230, 237.  Facts and circumstances at date of death.  5 H. 146, 149; 26 H. 219, 229; 31 H. 259.  In case of irreconcilable clauses, the latter will generally prevail and, in case of inconsistent general and specific provisions, the specific will prevail, but this rule does not apply where a contrary intent has been manifested.  21 H. 499, 505; 22 H. 233, 240; 22 H. 510, 514.  A conflict between two provisions is not to be regarded as irreconcilable unless harmony is found impossible.  23 H. 317.  "Die without a child", or "without leaving any issue", are somewhat ambiguous and may mean "without having had a child", or "without leaving any issue surviving", according to testator's intent as gathered from context.  See 10 H. 547; 12 H. 375.  Omissions in a will cannot be supplied by parol proof of intentions; declarations of testator are admissible only if there is a latent ambiguity.  22 H. 644, 650.  Technical words will be subordinated to intent of testator.  23 H. 747, 752, aff'd 255 F. 732; 27 H. 462, 463.  Technical words will be so construed, unless context shows a clear intent to contrary.  23 H. 747, aff'd 255 F. 732.  Greater latitude is allowed in construing technical words in wills than in deeds.  24 H. 298, 306. </P>
<P>  Common-law rules for construction of wills should not be followed where to follow them would result in overriding manifest intention of testator.  12 H. 375; 8 H. 392.  Striking out and inserting words where clear mistake.  12 H. 375; 22 H. 644.  Estates by implication.  15 H. 76; 22 H. 34; 36 H. 314.  Will of nonresident disposing of real estate here is governed by our law.  21 H. 556.  Presumption against intestacy.  28 H. 590, reversed on other grounds 26 F.2d 609; 29 H. 359.  Intention must control where manifest and unambiguous and not contrary to some rule of law and not against public policy.  33 H. 666; 33 H. 799; 34 H. 333. </P>
<P>  Designation of devisees and legatees and their respective shares:  Remainder to "heirs" means statutory heirs, which would include his widow where remainderman left no children; if he left children widow is not an "heir".  8 H. 392, 463; 10 H. 687, 695.  A devise to "my children who shall be living at my decease" excludes all but class designated.  23 H. 213; 29 H. 278.  Beneficiaries take per capita in equal shares.  23 H. 317; 29 H. 359.  Devises to a class-time of ascertainment of members of class.  31 H. 1; 59 F.2d 681; 31 H. 418.  See 32 H. 32, aff'd 61 F.2d 598.  "Heirs-at-law".  41 H. 249.  "Heirs".  42 H. 129. "Wish", "issue".  42 H. 640.  "Keiki".  47 H. 610, 393 P.2d 753.  An indefinite devise followed by a limitation over upon death of devisee ordinarily creates a life estate in first taker.  11 H. 101; 12 H. 19; 13 H. 196, 200.  In a given case whether devise is in fee simple or for life only, is to be ascertained from will taken as a whole.  21 H. 619, 622; 22 H. 233, 240.  For exceptions to statute of uses.  See 5 H. 146; 14 H. 138, 140; 22 H. 51, 57.  See also 26 H. 809, 815.  Life tenants and remaindermen--Rule in Howe v. Earl of Dartmouth.  26 H. 1. "Nephew and nieces" includes half-blood.  33 H. 299. </P>
<P>  Bequest or devise to two or more creates tenancy in common unless intention to create joint tenancy is clearly manifested.  2 H. 233; 8 H. 392; 23 H. 685.  Gift to relatives includes those of half-blood as well as of whole blood unless different intention manifested.  33 H. 299.  Word "children" generally means immediate offspring and does not include grandchildren.  23 H. 213; 27 H. 462; 29 H. 278. </P>
<P>  Survivorship, representation and substitution:  15 H. 76, 97, 98; 25 H. 22, 32.  A remainder contingent upon remainderman surviving first taker, with provision that interest passes by will upon death of first taker to remainderman's heirs if he deceases prior to first taker, extinguishes for all purposes remainderman's interest upon his failure to survive first taker and passes property to his heirs free from his incumbrances upon death of first taker.  23 H. 537.  Assignee.  30 H. 500, aff'd 31 F.2d 641.  Clause substituting children in event of death of beneficiary refers to death in lifetime of testator.  39 H. 619.  "Heirs and assigns" are words of limitation, not substitution.  43 H. 304, aff'd 282 F.2d 431.  Distribution under will to "my surviving children" upon death of any of such surviving children.  43 H. 391. </P>
<P>  Description of property:  A gift of "all other property owned by me", after devising property situated at a certain place, does not call for the application of the ejusdem generis rule.  18 H. 265, aff'd 214 U.S. 108.  See 29 H. 854.  As to distinct classification of personalty.  See 30 H. 217.  A bequest of rentals from property distinctly designated cannot be enlarged to include rents from adjoining property.  10 H. 77.  See 29 H. 815.  A devise of "all that piece and parcel of land" carries the fee.  14 H. 142.  See 13 H. 196.  Latent ambiguity in description.  4 H. 82; 13 H. 319.  Gift of all dividends and profits of stock for life does not pass stock dividend which must be apportioned.  35 H. 747. </P>
<P>  Nature of estates and interest created:  Provision for exclusive benefit of a donee for life, with no direction to use it for any other purpose, is an absolute gift--a vested interest--which may be assigned.  3 H. 421, 443; 6 H. 8.  Annuity to heirs to follow a life estate is vested in heirs and inheritable and assignable.  25 H. 174; 28 H. 590, reversed on other grounds 26 F.2d 609.  A condition against alienation following a devise in fee is void.  6 H. 694.  An estate created by devise, without a limitation to "heirs", is an estate of inheritance.  6 H. 694.  Devise to wife with provision that at her death devised property pass to others does not come within rule in Shelley's case, and creates a life estate only.  6 H. 692.  See 10 H. 543; 10 H. 547, 551; 11 H. 101; 12 H. 19; 12 H. 104; 13 H. 196, 200; 21 H. 619; 22 H. 233, 240; 22 H. 510; 29 H. 815.  As to a provision recognizing right of disposition.  See 8 H. 391.  As to personal estates.  See 7 H. 694; 9 H. 88.  Rule in Shelley's case definitely repudiated in Hawaii.  8 H. 392, 402; 12 H. 375, 389; 13 H. 196; 19 H. 78; 21 H. 74.

Devise of right of residence creates no transmissible estate.  3 H. 592.  A devise to beneficiaries to enjoy a certain home, free of rent, for a definite time is an estate for years, and not a mere devise to occupy the premises, and carries with it certain rights and obligations mentioned in.  24 H. 388.  Gift of income of property is gift of the property itself.  14 H. 378; 21 H. 499, 505; 21 H. 619, 622; 29 H. 815.  An annuity legacy constitutes claim against all assets, having priority to any claim or incumbrance within power of residuary legatee to create.  24 H. 419, 420; 24 H. 443.  Annuities discussed.  23 H. 685; 25 H. 327.  Estates tail and fee simple conditional cannot exist in Hawaii; construed as fee simple estates, or life estates with remainder over.  12 H. 375, 391, 394; 20 H. 372; 21 H. 699, aff'd 242 U.S. 612; 23 H. 537, 539; 23 H. 747, aff'd 255 F. 732; 25 H. 561.  See also 24 H. 298, 303.  A devise of "all that piece and parcel of land", though without words of inheritance, carries the fee.  6 H. 694; 10 H. 547, 551; 11 H. 47, 50; 13 H. 196; 13 H. 499; 14 H. 142; 21 H. 619, 621; 22 H. 233, 239.  See also, notes under description of property.  "Heirs" in deed, see discussion.  32 H. 769, (re construction see also, 283 U.S. 231).  "Nephews and nieces".  33 H. 299. Time.  34 H. 131.  Words of purchase or limitation.  See 14 H. 271; 21 H. 74; 23 H. 685. </P>
<P>  Vested or contingent estates and interest:  Devise in fee subject to prior life estate creates by will a vested remainder, fixed upon death of testator.  3 H. 233.  See 25 H. 174.  Sound policy and practical convenience requires that titles should be vested at earliest period, unless otherwise intended by clear expression.  28 H. 590 reversed on other grounds 26 F.2d 609.  But see 31 H. 1.  Executory devises are capable of being assigned or conveyed by deed and transmitted by will of person entitled thereto, or by inheritance and succession to his heirs or personal representatives; he may also by his acts release to first taker in possession and estop and bar his aim for all time.  12 H. 104, 117.  Equitable estates are governed by same rules as legal estates.  28 H. 590, reversed on other grounds 26 F.2d 609.  As to contingent executory devises and contingent interests.  See 14 H. 378; 18 H. 34, 45, aff'd 216 U.S. 367.  A vested remainder in fee defeasible by a subsequent condition, becomes absolute in devisee when condition becomes impossible of performance.  23 H. 338; 239 F. 450.  See 31 H. 535.  Contingent remainders alienable, descendible.  31 H. 418.  See 34 H. 25; 35 H. 501; 35 H. 689; 35 H. 795.  Vested.  39 H. 619. </P>
<P>  Conditions and restrictions:  All conditions repugnant to the full enjoyment of an absolute gift are void, and restrictions by will on use and enjoyment of a legacy must be clearly expressed in order to be effective, and are not inferable from mere statement of testator's object.  3 H. 421, 437; 6 H. 694; 20 H. 433, 441.  See 20 H. 372, 377; 20 H. 57, 59.  See also, 32 H. 323.  By appropriate language a devise in fee may be restricted to a life estate.  9 H. 88, 91.
