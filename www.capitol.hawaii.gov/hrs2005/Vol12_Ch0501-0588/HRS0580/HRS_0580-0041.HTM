</B>
<B><P>Decisions under prior law.</P>
</B><P>  "Divorce" defined.  25 H. 638.  Separation cannot be granted to libellee on answer and crossbill to libel.  9 H. 350.  But see 29 H. 464.  Misconduct though short of a ground of divorce, may justify wife's refusal to live with husband.  38 H. 1.</P>
<P>  Adultery may be proved by circumstantial evidence.  14 H. 68.  As to proof of adultery, habitual intemperance, extreme cruelty and failure to provide maintenance.  See 21 H. 474.</P>

Failure to provide no cause if wife deserts husband without reasonable cause; to bar the suit, offer to return after desertion must be made before desertion is complete.  23 H. 381; 26 H. 124; 30 H. 796.  Desertion, justification, grounds.  36 H. 49; 39 H. 552.</P>
<P>  Insane person by his guardian may bring libel for divorce.  9 H. 475.</P>
<P>  Chinese leprosy, court must be satisfied that libellee has contracted the disease; not sufficient that evidence satisfy ordinary and reasonable man.  11 H. 713.  See 33 H. 268.</P>
<P>  Extreme cruelty, what constitutes.  5 H. 260; 13 H. 707; 19 H. 378; 21 H. 284; 21 H. 339; 28 H. 217; 29 H. 689; 30 H. 354; 31 H. 25; 38 H. 114.  Cruelty less than "extreme cruelty" is not ground for divorce.  27 H. 280; 32 H. 177; 34 H.  312.  Provocation.  38 H. 114.</P>
<P>  See also as to sufficient proof of personal indignities.  32 H. 907.  On sufficiency of evidence.  36 H. 528, 606; 37 H. 17.  Evidence, general:  Preview of facts on appeal.  41 H. 37, 612.  Cruel treatment.  38 H. 368.</P>
<P>  Refusal by husband to support wife while absent without justifiable excuse not grounds for divorce for nonsupport.  27 H. 823.

Maintenance for wife, though applied for as "support," would be "separate maintenance" on basis of which, with other facts, divorce could be obtained, and when plaintiff asserts she does not want separate maintenance complaint must be dismissed.  49 H. 200, 412 P.2d 638.  Any living allowance granted to wife in an equitable action would be "separate maintenance" on basis of which, with other facts, divorce could be obtained.  49 H. 200, 412 P.2d 638.</P>
<P>  Separate grounds are separate causes of action, res adjudicata when applicable.  22 H. 429.  Divorce Act of 1870 not retroactive.  3 H. 300.</P>

<P>  Grievous mental suffering:  Libellant's testimony of willingness to live with libellee negated exact legal proof.  43 H. 381.</P>
<P>  Cited:  15 H. 313; 36 H. 659; 38 H. 394, 396, 605.</P>
