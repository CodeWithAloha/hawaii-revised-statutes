<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§560:3-811</B>  <B>Counterclaims.</B>  In allowing a claim the personal representative may deduct any counterclaim which the estate has against the claimant.  In determining a claim against an estate a court shall reduce the amount allowed by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims exceed the claim, render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess.  A counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction other than that upon which the claim is based.  A counterclaim may give rise to relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the claim. [L 1996, c 288, pt of §1]</P>
