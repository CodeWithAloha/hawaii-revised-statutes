<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§560:3-605</B>  <B>Demand for bond by interested person.</B>  Any person apparently having an interest in the estate worth in excess of $1000, or any creditor having a claim in excess of $1000, may make a written demand that a personal representative give bond.  The demand shall be filed with the court and a copy mailed to the personal representative, if appointment and qualification have occurred.  Thereupon, if ordered by the court, bond is required, but the requirement ceases if the person demanding bond ceases to be interested in the estate, or if bond is excused as provided in section 560:3-603 or 560:3-604.  After the personal representative has received notice and until the filing of the bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain from exercising any powers of the office except as necessary to preserve the estate.  Failure of the personal representative to meet a requirement of bond by giving suitable bond within thirty days after receipt of notice is cause of the personal representative's removal and appointment of a successor personal representative. [L 1996, c 288, pt of §1; am L 1997, c 244, §9]</P>
