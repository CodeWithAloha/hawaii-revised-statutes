If it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that an individual who would otherwise be an heir survived the decedent by one hundred twenty hours, it is deemed that the individual failed to survive for the required period.  This section is not to be applied if its application would result in a taking of intestate estate by the State under section 560:2-105. [L 1996, c 288, pt of §1]</P>
