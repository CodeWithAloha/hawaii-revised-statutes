<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§560:5-424  Protection of person dealing with conservator.  </B>(a)  A person who assists or deals with a conservator in good faith and for value in any transaction other than one requiring a court order under<B><I> </B></I>section 560:5-410 or 560:5-411 is protected as though the conservator properly exercised the power.  That a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of the exercise, but restrictions on powers of conservators that are endorsed on letters as provided in section 560:5-110 are effective as to third persons.  A person who pays or delivers assets to a conservator is not responsible for their proper application.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Protection provided by this section extends to any procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect that occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters and is not a substitute for protection provided to persons assisting or dealing with a conservator by comparable provisions in other law relating to commercial transactions or to simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries. [L 2004, c 161, pt of §1]</P>
