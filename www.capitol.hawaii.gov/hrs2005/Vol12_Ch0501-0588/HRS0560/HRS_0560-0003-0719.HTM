If a will provides for compensation of the personal representative and there is no contract with the decedent regarding compensation, the personal representative may renounce the provision before qualifying and be entitled to reasonable compensation.  A personal representative also may renounce the personal representative's right to all or any part of the compensation.  A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court.
