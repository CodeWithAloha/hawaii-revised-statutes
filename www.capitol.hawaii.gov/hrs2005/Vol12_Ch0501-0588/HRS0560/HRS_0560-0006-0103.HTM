<P>&#9;(b)  A payable-on-death account belongs to the original payee during the payee's lifetime and not to the payable-on-death payee or payees; if two or more parties are named as original payees, during their lifetimes rights as between them are governed by subsection (a) of this section. </P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Unless a contrary intent is manifested by the terms of the account or the deposit agreement or there is other clear and convincing evidence of an irrevocable trust, a trust account belongs beneficially to the trustee during the trustee's lifetime, and if two or more parties are named as trustee on the account, during their lifetimes beneficial rights as between them are governed by subsection (a) of this section.  If there is an irrevocable trust, the account belongs beneficially to the beneficiary. [L 1976, c 200, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]</P>
