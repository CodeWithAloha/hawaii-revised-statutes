If there are two or more surviving parties, their respective ownerships during lifetime shall be in proportion to their previous ownership interests under section 560:6-103 augmented by an equal share for each survivor of any interest the decedent may have owned in the account immediately before the decedent's death; and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties. </P>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;On death of one of two or more original payees the rights to any sums remaining on deposit are governed by subsection (a) of this section. </P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;On death of the sole original payee or of the survivor of two or more original payees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the payable-on-death payee or payees if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the original payee; if two or more payable- on-death payees survive, there is a right of survivorship in the event of death of a payable-on- death payee thereafter. </P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;On death of the sole trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the person or persons named as beneficiaries, if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the trustee, unless there is clear evidence of a contrary intent; if two or more beneficiaries survive, there is a right of survivorship in event of death of any beneficiary thereafter. </P></DIR>
