A person who knowingly and wilfully fails to so deliver or deposit a will is liable to any person aggrieved for any damages that may be sustained by the failure, and the court may award treble damages.  A person who wilfully refuses to deliver a will after being ordered by the court in a proceeding brought for the purpose of compelling delivery is subject to penalty for contempt of court.  Proceedings under this section shall be brought in the probate proceeding relating to the will. [L 1996, c 288, pt of §1]</P>
