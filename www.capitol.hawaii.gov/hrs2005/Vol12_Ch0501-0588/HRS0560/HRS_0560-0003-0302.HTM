<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§560:3-302</B>  <B>Informal probate; duty of registrar; effect of informal probate.</B>  (a)  Upon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will filed by a corporate fiduciary, by a parent, spouse, or reciprocal beneficiary of the decedent, or by a descendant of a parent of the decedent, the registrar, upon making the findings required by section 560:3-303, shall issue a written statement of informal probate appointing a personal representative subject to qualification and acceptance, if at least one hundred twenty hours have elapsed since the decedent's death.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Upon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will filed by someone other than as enumerated in subsection (a), the registrar shall set a date which shall be the earliest by which the registrar will decide the application.  On or after such date, upon making the findings required by section 560:3-303, the registrar shall issue a written statement of informal probate appointing a personal representative subject to qualification and acceptance if at least fourteen days have passed after the last mailing or other delivery of the advance notice required by section 560:3-306, if proof that such notice has been given is filed with the registrar and if no petition for formal testacy proceedings has been filed.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding.  No defect in the application or procedure relating thereto which leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void. [L 1996, c 288, pt of §1; am L 1997, c 244, §4 and c 383, §19]</P>
