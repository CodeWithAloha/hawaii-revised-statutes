<P>&#9;(b)  An order closing an estate as provided in section 560:3-1001 or 560:3-1002 terminates an appointment of a personal representative.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A personal representative may resign the position by filing a written statement of resignation with the registrar after the personal representative has given at least fifteen days written notice to the persons known to be interested in the estate.
