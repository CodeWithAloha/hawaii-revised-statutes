</DIR>

<P>whichever first occurs.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Unless a person having priority under section 560:5-310 has filed an acceptance of appointment, a guardian appointed under section 560:5-302 becomes eligible to act upon the filing of an acceptance of appointment, which shall be filed within thirty days after the guardian's appointment becomes effective.

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;File the notice of acceptance of appointment and a copy of the will with the court of the circuit in which the will was or could be probated or, in the case of another appointing instrument, file the acceptance of appointment and the appointing instrument with the court in the circuit in which the incapacitated person resides or is present; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Give written notice of the acceptance of appointment to the appointing parent, spouse, or reciprocal beneficiary if living, the incapacitated person, a person having care or custody of the incapacitated person other than the appointing parent, spouse, or reciprocal beneficiary, and the adult nearest in kinship.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(g)  The appointment of a guardian under this section is not a determination of incapacity.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>(h)<B>  </B>The powers of a guardian who timely complies with the requirements of subsections (b) and (e) relate back to give acts by the guardian, which are of benefit to the incapacitated person and occurred on or after the date the appointment became effective, the same effect as those that occurred after the filing of the acceptance of appointment.
