</B>
<P>  Circuit court properly denied appellant's petition for appointment as special administrator where appellant was not an "interested person", as defined in §560:1-201, who could petition the court under this section; appellant had no familial relationship to decedent's family, did not have a property right or claim against decedent's estate, and did not have priority under §560:3-203 to be appointed as personal representative of decedent's estate.  88 H. 148, 963 P.2d 1124.</P>
