<P>&#9;(f)  The court may also appoint a physician, psychologist, or other individual qualified to evaluate the alleged impairment to conduct an examination of the respondent.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  While a petition to establish a conservatorship or for another protective order is pending, after preliminary hearing and without notice to others, the court may issue orders to preserve and apply the property of the respondent as may be required for the support of the respondent or individuals who are in fact dependent upon the respondent.  The court may appoint a special conservator to assist in that task. [L 2004, c 161, pt of §1]</P>
