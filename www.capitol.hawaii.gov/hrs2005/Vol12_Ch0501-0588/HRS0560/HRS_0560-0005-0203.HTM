<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§560:5-203  Objection by minor or others to parental appointment.</B>  Until the court has confirmed an appointee under section 560:5-202, a minor who is the subject of an appointment by a parent and who has attained fourteen years of age, the other parent, or a person other than a parent or guardian having care or custody of the minor, may prevent or terminate the appointment at any time by filing a written objection in the court in which the appointing instrument is filed and giving notice of the objection to the guardian and any other persons entitled to notice of the acceptance of the appointment.  An objection may be withdrawn, and if withdrawn, is of no effect.  The objection shall not preclude judicial appointment of the person selected by the parent.  The court may treat the filing of an objection as a petition for the appointment of an emergency or a temporary guardian under section 560:5-204, and proceed accordingly. [L 2004, c 161, pt of §1]</P>
