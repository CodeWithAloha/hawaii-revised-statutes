[L 1996, c 288, pt of §1]</P>

</B>
<P>  A finding of undue influence on the part of the personal representative, who was also the proponent of the rejected will, precludes a finding that he or she defended or prosecuted the will contest in good faith; personal representative's request for attorneys' fees and expenses under this section thus denied.  91 H. 107, 979 P.2d 1133.</P>
