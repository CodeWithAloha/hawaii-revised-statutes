<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§523A-35  Agreement to locate reported property.</B>  No agreement entered into within two years after the report is filed under section 523A-17 shall be valid if any person thereby undertakes to locate property included in that report for a fee or other compensation.  Thereafter, any agreement entered into for the recovery or for assistance in the recovery of such property shall be valid if the fee or other compensation under such agreement does not exceed twenty per cent of the value of the property claimed.  Such an agreement shall be valid only if it is in writing, signed by the owner, and clearly sets forth the nature and value of the property and the value of the owner's share after the fee or compensation has been deducted.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any owner from asserting, at any time, that any agreement to locate property is based upon excessive or unjust consideration. [L 1983, c 37, pt of §2; am L 1986, c 271, §4]</P>
