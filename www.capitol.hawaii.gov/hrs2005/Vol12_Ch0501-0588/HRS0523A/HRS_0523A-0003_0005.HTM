<P>  Act 214, L 1996, which amended Hawaii's unclaimed property law to permit escheat of abandoned property, was constitutional; escheat notice under this section to include names of persons whose property will escheat even though value of property was between values of $5,000 and $100, recommended.  Att. Gen. Op. 98-4.</P>
