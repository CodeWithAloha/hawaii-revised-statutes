</B>
<P>&#9;<B>[§576B-201]  Bases for jurisdiction over nonresident.</B>  In a proceeding to establish, enforce, or modify a support order or to determine parentage, a tribunal of this State may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual or the individual's guardian or conservator if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The individual is personally served with summons or notice within this State;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The individual submits to the jurisdiction of this State by consent, by entering a general appearance, or by filing a responsive document having the effect of waiving any contest to personal jurisdiction;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The individual resided with the child in this State;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The individual resided in this State and provided prenatal expenses or support for the child;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The child resides in this State as a result of the acts or directives of the individual;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The individual engaged in sexual intercourse in this State and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;The individual asserted parentage in the office of health status monitoring maintained in this State by the department of health; or</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;There is any other basis consistent with the constitutions of this State and the United States for the exercise of personal jurisdiction. [L 1997, c 295, pt of §1]</P>

</B>
<P>  As Hawaii retains its continuing jurisdiction to enforce a child support order as long as the order has not been modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to chapter 576B or a law substantially similar to it, this section authorized the family court to enforce the child support order even though the father, mother, and children were no longer residents of this State.  98 H. 168 (App.), 45 P.3d 368.</P>
