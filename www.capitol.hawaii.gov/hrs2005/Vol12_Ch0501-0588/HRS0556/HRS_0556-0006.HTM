If, however, the check is payable to the drawee bank and is delivered to it in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary to it, the bank is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the check. [L 1945, c 197, §7; RL 1955, §189-7; HRS §556-6; gen ch 1985]</P>
