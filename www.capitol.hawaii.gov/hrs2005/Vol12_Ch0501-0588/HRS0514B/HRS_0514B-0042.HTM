<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;[§514B-42]  Metering of utilities.</B>  (a)  Units in a project that includes units designated for both residential and nonresidential use shall have separate meters, or calculations shall be made, or both, as may be practicable, to determine the use by the nonresidential units of utilities, including electricity, water, gas, fuel, oil, sewerage, air conditioning, chiller water, and drainage, and the cost of such utilities shall be paid by the owners of the nonresidential units; provided that the apportionment of the charges among owners of nonresidential units shall be done in a fair and equitable manner as set forth in the declaration or bylaws.  The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to projects for which construction commenced before January 1, 1978.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Subject to any approval requirements and spending limits contained in a project's declaration or bylaws, a board may authorize the installation of meters to determine the use by the individual units of utilities, including electricity, water, gas, fuel, oil, sewerage, air conditioning, chiller water, and drainage.  The cost of metered utilities shall be paid by the owners of the units based on actual consumption and, to the extent not billed directly to the unit owner by the utility provider, may be collected in the same manner as common expense assessments.  Owners' maintenance fees shall be adjusted as necessary to avoid any duplication of charges to owners for the cost of metered utilities. [L 2005, c 93, pt of §2]</P>
