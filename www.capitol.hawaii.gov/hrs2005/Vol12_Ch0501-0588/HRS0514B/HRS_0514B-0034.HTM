If the building or buildings have been built at the time the condominium property regime map is recorded, the certification shall state that, to the best of the architect's, engineer's, or surveyor's knowledge, the condominium property regime map depicts the layout, location, dimensions, and numbers of the units substantially as built.  If the building or buildings, or portions thereof, have not been built at the time the condominium property regime map is recorded, within thirty days from the completion of construction, the developer shall execute and record an amendment to the declaration accompanied by a certification of a licensed architect, engineer, or surveyor certifying that the condominium property regime map previously recorded, as amended by the revised pages filed with the amendment, if any, fully and accurately depicts the layout, location, boundaries, dimensions, and numbers of the units substantially as built.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If the condominium property regime is a conversion and the government official having jurisdiction over the issuance of permits for the construction of buildings in the county in which the condominium property regime is located is unable to locate the original permitted construction plans, the certification need only state that the condominium property regime map depicts the layout, location, boundaries, dimensions, and numbers of the units substantially as built.  If there are no buildings, no certification shall be required. [L 2005, c 93, pt of §2]</P>
