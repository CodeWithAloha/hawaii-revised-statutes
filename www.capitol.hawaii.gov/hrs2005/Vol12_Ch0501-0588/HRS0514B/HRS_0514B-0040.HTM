Any transfer shall be executed and recorded as an amendment to the declaration.  The amendment need only be executed by the owner of the unit whose limited common element is being transferred and the owner of the unit receiving the limited common element; provided that unit mortgages and leases may also require the consent of mortgagees or lessors, respectively, of the units involved.  A copy of the amendment shall be promptly delivered to the association. [L 2005, c 93, pt of §2]</P>
