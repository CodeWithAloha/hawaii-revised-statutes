<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;[§514B-136]  Transfer of developer rights.</B>  (a)  A developer right created or reserved under this chapter may be transferred only by a recorded instrument evidencing the transfer.  The instrument is not effective unless executed by the transferee.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Upon transfer of any developer right, the liability of a transferor developer is as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer, and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed upon the transferor by this chapter, if any.  Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If a successor to any developer right is an affiliate of a developer, the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the condominium;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If a transferor retains any developer rights, but transfers other developer rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the developer, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a developer by this chapter or by the declaration relating to the retained developer rights and arising after the transfer; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a developer right by a successor developer who is not an affiliate of the transferor.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  Unless otherwise provided in a mortgage instrument or other agreement creating a security interest, in case of foreclosure of a security interest, sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings, of any units owned by a developer or real estate in a condominium subject to development rights, a person acquiring title to all the property being foreclosed or sold, but only upon request, succeeds to all developer rights related to that property held by that developer.  The judgment or instrument conveying title must provide for the transfer of only the developer rights requested.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Upon foreclosure of a security interest, sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings, of all interests in a condominium owned by a developer:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The developer ceases to have any developer rights; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The period of developer control under section 514B-106(d) terminates unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all developer rights held by that developer to a successor developer.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  The liabilities and obligations of a person who succeeds to developer rights are as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A successor to any developer right who is an affiliate of a developer is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or by the declaration;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A successor to any developer right, other than a successor described in paragraph (3) or (4) or a successor who is an affiliate of a developer, is subject to the obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or the declaration:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;On a developer which relate to the successor's exercise or nonexercise of developer rights; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;On the transferor, other than:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;Misrepresentations by any previous developer;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;Warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous developer, or made before the condominium was created;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;Breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous developer or the developer's appointees to the board; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(iv)&#9;Any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions after the transfer;</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices, and signs, and who may not exercise any other developer right, is not subject to any liability or obligation as a developer, except the obligation to provide a public report, any liability arising as a result thereof, and the obligations under part IV; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;A successor to all developer rights held by a transferor who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed or other instrument of conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument conveying title under subsection (c), may declare in a recorded instrument the intention to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person.  Thereafter, until transferring all developer rights to any person acquiring title to any unit or real estate subject to development rights owned by the successor, or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by the transferor to control the board in accordance with section 514B-106(d) for the duration of any period of developer control, and any attempted exercise of those rights is void.  So long as a successor developer may not exercise developer rights under this subsection, the successor developer is not subject to any liability or obligation as a developer other than liability for the developer's acts and omissions under section 514B-106(d).</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(f)  Nothing in this section subjects any successor to a developer right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor developer, other than claims and obligations arising under this chapter or the declaration. [L 2004, c 164, pt of §2]</P>
