For example, an association may provide that for a nine-member board where two-thirds of the units are for residential use and one-third is for nonresidential use, sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the nine-member board, or six members, shall be owners of residential use units and thirty-three and one-third per cent, or three members, shall be owners of nonresidential use units.</P>

<P>&#9;(c)  Within thirty days of a decision by the board or receipt of a petition to initiate a bylaw amendment, the board shall mail a ballot with the proposed bylaw amendment to all of the unit owners of record.  For purposes of this section only, the bylaws may initially be amended by a vote or written consent of the majority of the unit owners; and thereafter by at least sixty-seven per cent of all unit owners; provided that each of the requirements set forth in this section shall be embodied in the bylaws.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The bylaws, as amended pursuant to this section, shall be recorded.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Election of the new board in accordance with an amendment adopted pursuant to this section shall be held at the next regular meeting of the association or at a meeting called in accordance with section 514B-121(b) for this purpose.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  As permitted in the declaration or bylaws, the vote of a nonresidential unit owner shall be cast and counted only for the nonresidential seats available on the board and the vote of a residential unit owner shall be cast and counted only for the residential seats available on the board.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  No petition for a bylaw amendment pursuant to subsection (b)(2) to modify the composition of the board shall be distributed to the unit owners within one year of the distribution of a prior petition to modify the composition of the board pursuant to subsection (b)(2).</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  This section shall not preclude the removal and replacement of any one or more members of the board pursuant to section 514B-106(f).  Any removal and replacement shall not affect the proportionate composition of the board as prescribed in the bylaws as amended pursuant to this section. [L 2004, c 164, pt of §2]</P>
