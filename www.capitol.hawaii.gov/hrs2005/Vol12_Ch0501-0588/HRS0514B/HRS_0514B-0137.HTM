Each unit owner shall afford to the association and the other unit owners, and to their agents or employees, during reasonable hours, access through the owner's unit reasonably necessary for those purposes.  If damage is inflicted on the common elements or on any unit through which access is taken, the unit owner responsible for the damage, or the association, if it is responsible, is liable for the prompt repair thereof; provided that the association shall not be responsible to pay the costs of removing any finished surfaces or other barriers that impede its ability to maintain and repair the common elements.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The association shall have the irrevocable right, to be exercised by the board, to have access to each unit at any time as may be necessary for making emergency repairs to prevent damage to the common elements or to another unit or units. [L 2004, c 164, pt of §2]</P>
