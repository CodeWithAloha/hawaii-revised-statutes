<P>&#9;(3)&#9;No developer, employee or agent of the developer, or any real estate licensee, either directly or through any other person, shall release any information or inform any prospective owner-occupant about the publication announcement or advertisement referred to in section 514B-95.5, including the date it is to appear and when the chronological system will be initiated, until after the announcement or advertisement is published; provided that a developer, as part of any preregistration solicitation permitted under section 514B-85, may disclose whether units will be offered to owner-occupants pursuant to this subpart and whether a chronological or lottery system will be used; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The developer shall compile and maintain a list of all prospective purchasers that submit a completed owner-occupant affidavit, an executed sales contract or reservation, and an earnest money deposit, and maintain a back-up reservation list, if any.

Any person, including all prospective owner-occupants eligible for the lottery, shall be allowed to attend the lottery;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The public lottery shall be conducted so that no prospective owner-occupant shall have an unfair advantage and, as to all owner-occupants whose affidavits were submitted to the developer or the developer's real estate broker within the time period specified in paragraph (1), shall be conducted without regard to the order in which the affidavits were submitted.  If two or more prospective owner-occupants intend to reside jointly in the same residential unit, only one of them shall be entitled to enter the public lottery; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;After the public lottery, each prospective owner-occupant purchaser, in the order in which they are selected in the lottery, shall be given the opportunity to select one of the residential units that have been designated pursuant to section 514B-96, execute a sales contract, and submit an earnest money deposit in a reasonable amount designated by the developer.  The developer shall maintain a list, in the order of selection, of all prospective purchasers selected in the lottery, and maintain a list of all prospective purchasers who selected one of the residential units designated pursuant to section 514B-96.
