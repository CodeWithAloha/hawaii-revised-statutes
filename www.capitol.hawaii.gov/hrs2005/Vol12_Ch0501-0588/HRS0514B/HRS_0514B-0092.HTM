<P>&#9;(c)  A purchaser's deposits may be disbursed prior to closing only to pay costs set forth in the project budget submitted pursuant to subsection (b)(3)(A) that are approved for payment by the project lender or an otherwise qualified, financially disinterested person.  In addition, purchaser deposits may be disbursed prior to closing to pay construction costs only in proportion to the valuation of the work completed by the contractor, as certified by a licensed architect or engineer.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If purchaser deposits are to be disbursed prior to closing, the following notice shall be prominently displayed in the developer's public report for the project:</P>

<B><P>&#9;"Important Notice Regarding Your Deposits: </B> Deposits that you make under your sales contract for the purchase of the unit may be disbursed before closing of your purchase to pay for project costs, construction costs, project architectural, engineering, finance, and legal fees, and other incidental expenses of the project.  While the developer has submitted satisfactory evidence that the project should be completed, it is possible that the project may not be completed.  If your deposits are disbursed to pay project costs and the project is not completed, there is a risk that your deposits will not be refunded to you.  You should carefully consider this risk in deciding whether to proceed with your purchase."</P>
