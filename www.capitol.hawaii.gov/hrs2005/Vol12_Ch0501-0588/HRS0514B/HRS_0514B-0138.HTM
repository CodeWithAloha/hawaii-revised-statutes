<P>&#9;(c)  The imposition of requirements by the board under subsection (b) shall not relieve unit owners of obligations regarding high-risk components as set forth in the declaration or bylaws including, without limitation, the obligation to maintain, repair, and replace the components.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If a unit owner fails to follow requirements imposed by the board pursuant to this section, the association, after reasonable notice, shall enter the unit to perform the requirements with regard to such high-risk components at the sole cost and expense of the unit owner, which costs and expenses shall be a lien on the unit as provided in section 514B-146.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the remedies of the association for damages, or injunctive relief, or both. [L 2004, c 164, pt of §2]</P>
