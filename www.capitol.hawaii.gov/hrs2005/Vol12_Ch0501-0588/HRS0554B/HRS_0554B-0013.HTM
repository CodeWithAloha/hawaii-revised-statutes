If the beneficiary is incapacitated, or fails to act within ninety days after the ineligibility, resignation, death, or incapacity of the custodial trustee, the beneficiary's conservator becomes successor custodial trustee; and, if the beneficiary does not have a conservator or the conservator declines to act, the resigning custodial trustee may designate a successor custodial trustee.</P>
