Worksheets that are stored on computer media shall be reduced to printed form for the lessee.  The worksheets shall be maintained by the retail lessor or its agents during the first six months of the term of the lease agreement.  The retail lessor shall not be required to provide those portions of any worksheets that contain dealer markup information or lease assignment settlement amounts.
