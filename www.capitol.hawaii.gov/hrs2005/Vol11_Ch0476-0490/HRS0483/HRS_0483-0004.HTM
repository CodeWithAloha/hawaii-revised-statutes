</B>
<P>  Where there was no reservation of rights in purchase agreement option by obligee against one co-obligor and no relationship between the co-obligors as joint debtors requiring payment, indemnification or contribution, §483-5 did not apply; thus, as there was no reservation of rights in purchase option by obligee against one co-obligor, as required under this section, the purchase option which discharged that co-obligor from liability for the balance due under the agreement of sale discharged the other co-obligor as well.  89 H. 461 (App.), 974 P.2d 1051.</P>
