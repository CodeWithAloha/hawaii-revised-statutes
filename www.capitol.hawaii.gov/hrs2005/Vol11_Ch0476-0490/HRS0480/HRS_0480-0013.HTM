<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The minimum $1,000 recovery provided in subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply in a class action or a de facto class action lawsuit;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;In class actions or de facto class actions where both direct and indirect purchasers are involved, or where more than one class of indirect purchasers are involved, a defendant shall be entitled to prove as a partial or complete defense to a claim for compensatory damages that the illegal overcharge has been passed on or passed back to others who are themselves entitled to recover so as to avoid the duplication of recovery of compensatory damages;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;That portion of threefold damages in excess of compensatory damages shall be apportioned and allocated by the court in its exercise of discretion so as to promote effective enforcement of this chapter and deterrence from violation of its provisions;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;In no event shall an indirect purchaser be awarded less than the full measure of compensatory damages attributable to the indirect purchaser;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;In any lawsuit or lawsuits in which claims are asserted by both direct purchasers and indirect purchasers, the court is authorized to exercise its discretion in the apportionment of damages, and in the transfer and consolidation of cases to avoid the duplication of the recovery of damages and the multiplicity of suits, and in other respects to obtain substantial fairness;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;In any case in which claims are being asserted by a part of the claimants in a court of this State and another part of the claimants in a court other than of this State, where the claims arise out of same or overlapping transactions, the court is authorized to take all steps reasonable and necessary to avoid duplication of recovery of damages and multiplicity of suits, and in other respects, to obtain substantial fairness; </P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;In instances where indirect purchasers file an action and obtain a judgment or settlement prior to the completion of a direct purchaser's action in courts other than this State, the court shall delay disbursement of the damages until such time as the direct purchaser's suits are resolved to either final judgment, consent decree or settlement, or in the absence of a direct purchaser's lawsuit in the courts other than this State by direct purchasers, the expiration of the statute of limitations, or in such manner that will minimize duplication of damages to the extent reasonable and practicable, avoid multiplicity of suit, and obtain substantial fairness; and</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;In the event damages in a class action or de facto class action remain unclaimed by the direct or indirect purchasers, the class representative or the attorney general shall apply to the court and such funds shall escheat to the State upon showing that reasonable efforts made by the State to distribute the funds have been unsuccessful.</P></DIR>

Supp. 1438.</P>
<P>  Plaintiffs' unfair or deceptive acts or practices claims dismissed; this section and §480-2 do not provide a cause of action for personal injury claims.  100 F. Supp. 2d 1265.</P>

<P>  Real estate or residences did not qualify as "goods" under §480-1, but did qualify as "personal investments"; homebuyer thus had standing as "consumer" to bring claim under this section.  80 H. 54, 905 P.2d 29.</P>

<P>  Where employer was not a "consumer" as defined under §480-1, employee could not maintain action under this section, based on employee's third party beneficiary status, against workers' compensation insurer for alleged violation of §480-2.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858.</P>
<P>  There is no private claim for relief under this section for unfair methods of competition in violation of §480-2; private remedy is restricted to claims of unfair or deceptive acts or practices.  91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.</P>
<P>  Where appellants failed to adduce evidence of a causal connection  between appellees' "anticompetitive" conduct and appellees' alleged monopoly power, trial court properly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to sustain appellants' attempt to monopolize claim under §480-9; thus, as appellants failed to prove a violation of chapter 480, appellants had no standing to bring claim for relief under subsection (a).  91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.</P>
<P>  As subsection (b) enumerates the specific damages that a consumer may recover under this chapter and makes no provision for punitive damages, plaintiffs were precluded from seeking punitive damages under this chapter.  98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.</P>
<P>  By the plain language of this chapter, no actual purchase is necessary as a prerequisite to a consumer recovering damages under this section, based on injuries stemming from violations of §480-2.  98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.</P>

<P>  Plaintiff suing store's commercial general liability insurer for injuries received in slip and fall was not "consumer" as defined in §480-1, and therefore lacked standing to maintain private cause of action under this section.  82 H. 363 (App.), 922 P.2d 976.</P>
<P>  When litigant is entitled to treble damages under this section, trial court shall not award three times compensatory damages plus compensatory damages; proper measurement of treble damages is simply three times compensatory damages.  84 H. 162 (App.), 931 P.2d 604.</P>
<P>  In action by consumer under §480-2, "unclean hands" of consumer not a defense to claim for damages under subsection (b)(1).  86 H. 405 (App.), 949 P.2d 1026.</P>
<P>  Though section does not provide for setoff in unfair and deceptive trade practice cases, under certain circumstances, such setoff allowable; court properly awarded defendant car dealer car's ten-day rental value and cost of repairs for damage to car inflicted by plaintiff.  86 H. 405 (App.), 949 P.2d 1026.</P>
