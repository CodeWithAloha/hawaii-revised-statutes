</B>
<P>  A partially illegal contract may be upheld by severing the illegal portion.  61 H. 607, 607 P.2d 1304.</P>
<P>  As this section voided the contract between homeowner and contractor, §507-42 and this section precluded the imposition of a §507-42 lien upon the homeowner's property by contractor who failed to comply with the requirements of §444-25.5.  96 H. 365 (App.), 31 P.3d 222.</P>
<P>  Section 444-25.5(d) and this section do not preclude some recovery in quantum meruit from a homeowner by a contractor who fails to comply with the requirements of §444-25.5; the amount cannot exceed the amount that would have been due the general contractor under the contract had the contract not been void, less the amount previously paid the contractor and the total of the amount paid and owed to all sub-contractors and materialmen.  96 H. 365 (App.), 31 P.3d 222.</P>
