</B>
<P>  Because defendant wholesale food marketer and distributor did not meet definition of a consumer, it lacked standing to sue for deceptive practices under §480-2.  61 F. Supp. 2d 1092.</P>
<P>  Defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim under §480-4 granted; although the word "commodity" was defined to include "any other business", the purchase of real estate by an individual owner could not be considered a business.  338 F. Supp. 2d 1106.</P>
<P>  Suit against State based on this chapter precluded by sovereign immunity.  60 H. 228, 588 P.2d 430.</P>
<P>  Real estate or residences did not qualify as "goods" under this section, but did qualify as "personal investments"; homebuyer thus had standing as "consumer" to bring claim under §480-13.  80 H. 54, 905 P.2d 29.</P>
<P>  Where employee was not a "consumer" as defined under this section, employee lacked standing to maintain private cause of action under §480-13 against workers' compensation insurer based on alleged violation of §480-2.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858.</P>
<P>  Where employer was not a "consumer" as defined under this section, employee could not maintain action under §480-13, based on employee's third party beneficiary status, against workers' compensation insurer for alleged violation of §480-2.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858.</P>
<P>  By the plain language of this chapter, no actual purchase is necessary as a prerequisite to a consumer recovering damages under §480-13, based on injuries stemming from violations of §480-2.  98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff suing store's commercial general liability insurer for injuries received in slip and fall was not "consumer" as defined in this section, and therefore lacked standing to maintain private cause of action under §480-13.  82 H. 363 (App.), 922 P.2d 976.</P>
