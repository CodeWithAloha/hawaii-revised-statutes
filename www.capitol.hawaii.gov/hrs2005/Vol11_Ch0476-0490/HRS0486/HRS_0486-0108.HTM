The department, through the measurement standards branch, shall reject and mark or tag as "rejected" such measures and measurement standards as it finds, upon inspection and test, to be in noncompliance provided that sealing or marking shall not be required with respect to such measures and measurement standards as may be exempted therefrom by a rule of the board adopted under section 486-7.  Measures and measurement standards that have been rejected may be confiscated and may be destroyed by the department, through the measurement standards branch, if not corrected as required by section 486-109, or if used or disposed of contrary to the requirements of section 486-109.  In carrying out this section, the department, through the measurement standards branch, may use such terms as "rejected," "accepted," "incorrect," "inaccurate," "accurate," "tested," "approved," "certified," or terms of similar import on marks or tags or certificates, as necessary, to convey to all interested parties the condition or state of the device or apparatus.  Any such mark or tag shall be subject to section 486-7 and its unauthorized application or removal shall be a violation of this chapter. [L 1991, c 153, pt of §6; am L 1998, c 192, §5]</P>
