<B><P> </B> <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  This section incorporates a type of statute adopted in twenty-six jurisdictions.  The time limit is set at six months because banking and commercial practice regards a check outstanding for longer than that period as stale, and a bank will normally not pay such a check without consulting the depositor.  It is therefore not required to do so, but is given the option to pay because it may be in a position to know, as in the case of dividend checks, that the drawer wants payment made.</P>
<P>  Certified checks are excluded from the section because they are the primary obligation of the certifying bank (Sections 3-411 and 3-413), which obligation runs direct to the holder of the check.  The customer's account was charged when the check was certified.</P>
