<P>&#9;(b)  A system satisfies subsection (a), and a person is deemed to have control of an electronic document of title, if the document is created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that:</P><DIR>

<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A single authoritative copy of the document exists that is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), unalterable;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The person to which the document was issued; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;If the authoritative copy indicates that the document has been transferred, the person to which the document was most recently transferred;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person asserting control or its designated custodian;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Copies or amendments that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control; </P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Any amendment of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized. [L 2004, c 163, pt of §1]</P>
