<P>&#9;(a)&#9;The seller must discharge all liens arising out of the carriage and furnish the buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to deliver the goods; and</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;The risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ship's tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded. [L 1965, c 208, §2-322; HRS §490:2-322]</P>

<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  The delivery term, "ex ship", as between seller and buyer, is the reverse of the f.a.s. term covered.</P>
<P>  2.  Delivery need not be made from any particular vessel under a clause calling for delivery "ex ship", even though a vessel on which shipment is to be made originally is named in the contract, unless the agreement by appropriate language, restricts the clause to delivery from a named vessel.</P>
<P>  3.  The appropriate place and manner of unloading at the port of destination depend upon the nature of the goods and the facilities and usages of the port.</P>
<P>  4.  A contract fixing a price "ex ship" with payment "cash against documents" calls only for such documents as are appropriate to the contract.  Tender of a delivery order and of a receipt for the freight after the arrival of the carrying vessel is adequate.  The seller is not required to tender a bill of lading as a document of title nor is he required to insure the goods for the buyer's benefit as the goods are not at the buyer's risk during the voyage.</P>
