<P>&#9;(b)  Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of any person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated.  That title may be defeated under section 490:7-504 to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of any person to which a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated.  However, delivery by the carrier in accordance with part 4 pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver. [L 2004, c 163, pt of §1]</P>
