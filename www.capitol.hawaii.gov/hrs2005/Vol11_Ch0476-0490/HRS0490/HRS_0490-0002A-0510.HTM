<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§490:2A-510  Installment lease contracts:  rejection and default.</B>  (a)  Under an installment lease contract a lessee may reject any delivery that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that delivery and cannot be cured or the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (b) and the lessor or the supplier gives adequate assurance of its cure, the lessee must accept that delivery.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more deliveries substantially impairs the value of the installment lease contract as a whole there is a default with respect to the whole.  But, the aggrieved party reinstates the installment lease contract as a whole if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming delivery without seasonably notifying of cancellation or brings an action with respect only to past deliveries or demands performance as to future deliveries. [L 1991, c 40, pt of §1]</P>
