<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§490:9-334  Priority of security interests in fixtures and crops.</B>  (a)  A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures.  A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The security interest is a purchase-money security interest;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days thereafter.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Factory or office machines;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;Replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article; or</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The security interest is:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Perfected pursuant to a statute described in section 490:9-311(a)(2).</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(f)  A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(g)  The priority of the security interest under subsection (f) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction.  A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.</P>
<P>&#9;(i)  A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property. [L 2000, c 241, pt of §1]</P>
