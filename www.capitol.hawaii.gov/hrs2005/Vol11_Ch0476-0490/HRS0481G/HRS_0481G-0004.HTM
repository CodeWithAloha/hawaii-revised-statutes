<P>&#9;(b)  A dealer suffering damages as a result of the termination or cancellation of, or failure to renew, the dealership may bring an action under this section against the distributor who wrongfully or illegally terminated, canceled, or unreasonably refused to renew the dealership in the court of general jurisdiction of the dealer's principal place of business.  The action may be brought without regard to the amount in controversy.  If the dealer prevails in the action, the dealer may recover actual damages sustained, the costs of the suit, including reasonable attorney's fees, and such equitable relief as the court deems proper.</P>
<P>&#9;The court may also grant such temporary relief as it may deem necessary and proper.</P>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Of other legitimate business reasons; provided that a termination, cancellation, or failure to renew a dealership for the purpose of enabling the distributor to assume operation of the dealer's business shall not be considered to be a legitimate business reason unless the dealer is paid reasonable compensation for the value of the dealership, including good will.</P></DIR>
