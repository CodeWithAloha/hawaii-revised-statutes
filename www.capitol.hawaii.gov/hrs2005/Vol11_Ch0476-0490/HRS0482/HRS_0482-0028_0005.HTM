<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The registered mark has been abandoned;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The registered mark has not been used by the registrant in accordance with the declaration either in this State or elsewhere in the United States for a period of three hundred sixty-five consecutive days and has not been registered in the name of the registrant in the United States Patent and Trademark Office;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The registration was granted improperly;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The registration was obtained fraudulently;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The registered mark is or has become the generic name for the goods or services, or a portion thereof, for which it has been registered; or</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The registered mark is so similar, as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive, to a mark registered by another person in the United States Patent and Trademark Office prior to the date of filing the application for registration under this part; provided that if a registrant proves that the registrant is the owner of a concurrent registration of a mark registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office that covers an area including this State, the registration shall not be revoked for such an area.</P></DIR>

<P>The petition shall set forth facts in support of the petitioner's ownership of the mark and the claim for revocation.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The petitioner, at the petitioner's expense, shall notify the registrant of the hearing in the manner prescribed by the director and section 91-9.5, and the registrant shall be given the opportunity of a full hearing in accordance with chapter 91.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  After granting an opportunity for hearing to the petitioner and the registrant, the director shall grant or deny the petition for revocation, as the facts shall warrant. [L 2003, c 124, §4]</P>
