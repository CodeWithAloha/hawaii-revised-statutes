<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§262-7  Permits, hazard markings, and lighting.</B>  (a) Permits.  Any airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter may require that before any new structure, tree, or use may be constructed, planted, or established, and before any existing use, tree, or structure may be substantially changed, replanted, or substantially altered or repaired, a permit be obtained authorizing such construction, planting, establishment, change, replanting, alteration, or repair.  In any event, all the regulations shall provide that before any nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the department of transportation authorizing the replacement, alteration, repair, rebuilding, or replanting.  No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment, maintenance, or creation of an airport hazard.  Except as provided herein, all applications for permits shall be granted.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Hazard markings and lighting.  In granting any permit under this section, the director may, if the director deems such action advisable to effectuate the purposes of this chapter and reasonable under the circumstances, so condition such permit as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the State, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to operators of aircraft the presence of an airport hazard.
