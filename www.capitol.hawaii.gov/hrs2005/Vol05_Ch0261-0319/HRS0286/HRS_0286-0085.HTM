</B>
<P>  Where Hawaii county did not require posting of reconstructed vehicle permit decal on vehicle and no evidence that defendant actually operated vehicle, officer’s suspicion that defendant operated a reconstructed vehicle without a valid permit was not reasonable; thus, evidence of DUI and no reconstruction permit was illegally obtained through an unconstitutional warrantless seizure.  87 H. 487 (App.), 960 P.2d 157.</P>
