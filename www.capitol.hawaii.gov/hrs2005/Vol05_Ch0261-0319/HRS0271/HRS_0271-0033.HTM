<P>  Given that the "aggrieved party" provision of §271-32(e) did not apply to the case, supreme court had jurisdiction to hear competitor's appeal; competitor appealed from a final order of the public utilities commission and from the commission's denial of competitor's motion for reconsideration; thus, competitor satisfied the requirements of §271-32(e) and this section.  104 H. 98, 85 P.3d 623.</P>
