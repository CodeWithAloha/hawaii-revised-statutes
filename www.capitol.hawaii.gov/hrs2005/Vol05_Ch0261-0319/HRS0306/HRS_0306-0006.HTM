The validity of the bonds shall not be dependent on nor affected by the validity or regularity of any proceedings relating to the construction or maintenance of the university project or projects or university system or systems for which the bonds were issued.  The resolution authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds may provide that the bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this chapter, which recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance.
