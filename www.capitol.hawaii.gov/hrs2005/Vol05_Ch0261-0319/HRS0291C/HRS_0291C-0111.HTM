<P>&#9;<B>§291C-111  Noncompliance with stopping, standing, or parking requirements.</B>  (a)  With respect to highways under their respective jurisdictions, the director of transportation is authorized to and the counties by ordinance may prohibit or restrict the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles where the stopping, standing, or parking is dangerous to those using the highway or where the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles would interfere unduly with the free movement of traffic; provided that the violation of any law or any ordinance, regardless of whether established under this or any other section, prohibiting or restricting the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles shall constitute a traffic infraction.  The counties shall not provide any other penalty, civil or criminal, or any other charge, in the form of rental or otherwise, in place of or in addition to the fine to be imposed by the district court for any violation of any ordinance prohibiting or restricting the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles.</P>
<P>&#9;This section shall not be construed as prohibiting the authority of the director of transportation or the counties to allow the stopping, standing, or parking of motor vehicles at a "T-shaped" intersection on highways under their respective jurisdictions; provided that such stopping, standing, or parking of motor vehicles is not dangerous to those using the highway or where the stopping, standing, or parking of motor vehicles would not unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic.</P>
<P>&#9;The appropriate police department and county or prosecuting attorney of the various counties shall enforce any law or ordinance prohibiting or restricting the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles, including but not limited to the issuance of parking tickets.  Any person committing a violation of any law or ordinance, regardless of whether established under this or any other section, prohibiting or restricting the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles shall be subject to a fine to be enforced and collected by the district courts of this State and to be deposited into the state general fund for state use.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The director of transportation, the counties, and owners of private highways, with the consent of the county official responsible for traffic control with respect to highways under their respective jurisdictions shall place signs or curb markings which are clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person prohibiting or restricting the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles on the highway.  Such signs or curb markings shall be official signs and markings and no person shall stop, stand, or park any vehicle in violation of the restrictions stated on such signs or markings.
