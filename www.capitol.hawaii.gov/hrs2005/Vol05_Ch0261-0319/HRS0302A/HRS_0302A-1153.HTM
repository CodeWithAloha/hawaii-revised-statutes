<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§302A-1153  Vandalism damage to public school property.</B>  (a)  Any pupil found to be responsible for an act of vandalism against any public school, building, facility, or ground shall make restitution in any manner, including monetary restitution by the pupil or pupil's parents, or guardian, or both.</P>
<P>&#9;This section shall be in addition to, and shall in no way limit the provisions of any other law concerning, offenses against property rights.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  No pupil, parent, or guardian shall be required to make restitution in any manner unless the pupil and the parents or guardian have been notified and have been given an opportunity to be heard, on any report of vandalism involving the pupil, and the pupil, parent, or guardian have executed a written agreement to make restitution.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The principal of the school in which the vandalism occurred shall make or order an investigation of the vandalism.  If after the investigation, the principal has reasonable cause to believe that a specific pupil is responsible for the vandalism, the principal shall schedule a conference with the pupil and the pupil's parents or guardian.  Except for the principal of the school in which the vandalism occurred, the pupil and the parents or guardian, no other person shall be permitted to be in the conference for any reason.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  At the conference, the principal of the school in which the vandalism occurred shall present the findings of the investigation and the requirements of restitution to the pupil and parents or guardian.</P>
<P>&#9;If the pupil and the parents or guardian agree with the findings of the principal and the manner in which restitution is to be made, the principal and the pupil and parent or guardian shall execute a written agreement which shall specify the manner in which restitution is to be made.</P>
<P>&#9;Agreements shall be made only for damages that do not exceed $3,500.</P>
<P>&#9;If restitution is made in this fashion, then no information about the investigation, conference, and the actions taken shall be communicated to any person not directly involved in the proceedings.</P>
<P>&#9;If the pupil and parent or guardian do not agree with the findings made by the principal, the principal shall report the findings, including all the records and documents regarding the investigation and conference, to the complex area superintendent, who shall review the findings and may refer the matter to the attorney general for any further action pursuant to section 577-3.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  If the damages exceed $3,500, the principal shall report the matter to the complex area superintendent, who shall refer the matter to the attorney general for any further action pursuant to section 577-3.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Notwithstanding any provisions in this section to the contrary, the State may elect to bring any appropriate action for the recovery of all damages to school properties.  Nothing in this section shall limit the right of the State to bring an action against any person to recover these damages. [L 1996, c 89, pt of §2; am L 2003, c 187, §11]</P>
