Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the department shall adopt rules under chapter&nbsp;91 as are deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of this section and may issue licenses, revocable permits, concessions, or rights of entry to school buildings and grounds for such periods of use as deemed appropriate by the department.  All such dispositions, including those in excess of fourteen days, need not be approved by the board of land and natural resources; provided that approval by the board of land and natural resources shall be required when the dispositions are for periods in excess of a year.  The department may assess and collect fees and charges from the users of school buildings, facilities, grounds, and equipment.  The fees and charges shall be deposited into a separate fund and expended by the department under rules as may be adopted by the board. [L 1996, c 89, pt of §2]</P>
