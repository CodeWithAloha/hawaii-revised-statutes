<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§302A-408  After-school and weekend programs.</B>  The department and the appropriate county agencies may establish and regulate programs of after-school and weekend community-school activities for children, including but not limited to child-care programs, arts and crafts, hula, ukulele, and other recreational projects, wherever feasible, at public school and public park facilities.  In addition to any appropriation of public funds, reasonable fees established by the agencies operating the programs may be collected from children enrolled, in the furtherance of particular programs.  The appropriate agencies may obtain from time to time the services of persons in a voluntary or unpaid capacity, exempt from chapter 76, as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this section, and may regulate their duties, powers, and responsibilities when not otherwise provided by law.  Any person whose services have been so accepted, while engaged in the performance of duty under this section, shall be deemed a state employee or an employee of a political subdivision, as the case may be, in determining the liability of the State or the political subdivision for the negligent acts of these persons.
