<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;§304-6  Suits.</B>  (a)  The university may sue and be sued in its corporate name.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, all claims arising out of the acts or omissions of the university or the members of its board of regents, its officers, or its employees, including claims permitted against the State under chapter 661, and claims for torts permitted against the State under chapter 662, may be brought only pursuant to this section, and only against the university.  However, the university shall be subject to suit only in the manner provided for suits against the State, including section 661-11, and any liability incurred by the university in such a suit shall be solely the liability of the university, shall be payable solely from the moneys and property of the university, and shall not constitute a general obligation of the State, or be secured directly or indirectly by the full faith and credit of the State or the general credit of the State, or by any revenue or taxes of the State.  All defenses available to the State, as well as all limitations on actions against the State, shall be applicable to the university.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The board of regents, upon the advice of its attorney, may arbitrate, compromise, or settle any claim, action, or suit brought against the university pursuant to this section.  Any claim compromised or settled under this subsection shall be payable solely from the moneys and property of the university and shall not constitute a general obligation of the State, or be secured directly or indirectly by the full faith and credit of the State or the general credit of the State, or by any revenue or taxes of the State.  Nothing in this subsection precludes the board of regents from requesting and securing legislative appropriations to fund the settlement of any such claim or judgment against the university, its regents, officers, employees, or agents.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Rights and remedies conferred by this section shall be exclusive and shall not be construed to authorize any other claim, suit, or action against the State.  In addition, a judgment, compromise, or settlement in an action brought against the university under this section shall constitute a complete bar to any action brought by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the State or an officer or employee of the university.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The university may purchase insurance to cover any claims anticipated under this section. [L 1919, c 203, §8; RL 1925, §407; RL 1935, §825; RL 1945, §1945; RL 1955, §44-5; am L 1959, c 92, §1; HRS §304-6; am L 1998, c 115, §16; am L 1999, c 102, §2]</P>
