<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§269-102  Standard contract or tariff; rate structure.</B>  (a)  Every electric utility shall develop a standard contract or tariff providing for <STRONG>net</STRONG> <STRONG>energy</STRONG> <STRONG>metering </STRONG>and shall make this contract available to eligible customer-generators, upon request, on a first-come-first-served basis until the time that the total rated generating capacity produced by eligible customer-generators equals .5 per cent of the electric utility's system peak demand; provided that the public utilities commission may increase, by rule or order, the total rated generating capacity produced by eligible customer-generators to an amount above .5 per cent of the electric utility's system peak demand.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Each <STRONG>net</STRONG> <STRONG>energy</STRONG> <STRONG>metering</STRONG> contract or tariff shall be identical, with respect to rate structure, to the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned if the customer was not an eligible customer-generator.  The charges for all retail rate components for eligible customer-generators shall be based exclusively on the eligible customer-generator's <STRONG>net</STRONG> kilowatt-hour consumption over a monthly billing period.  Any new or additional demand charge, standby charge, customer charge, minimum monthly charge, interconnection charge, or other charge that would increase an eligible customer-generator's costs beyond those of other customers in the rate class to which the eligible customer-generator would otherwise be assigned are contrary to the intent of this section, and shall not form a part of <STRONG>net</STRONG> <STRONG>energy</STRONG> <STRONG>metering </STRONG>contracts or tariffs.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The public utilities commission may amend the rate structure or standard contract or tariff by rule or order. [L 2001, c 272, pt of §6; am L 2005, c 104, §3]</P>
