These costs include but shall not be limited to: the cost of photocopying documents; conditional license permits, temporary permits, temporary motor vehicle registrations, temporary number plates, and relicensing forms; interpreter services; and other similar costs; provided that the costs of issuing subpoenas for witnesses, including mileage fees, shall be borne by the party requesting the subpoena.
