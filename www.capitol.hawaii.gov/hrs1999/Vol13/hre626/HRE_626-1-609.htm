<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>Rule 609  Impeachment by evidence of conviction of crime.</B>  (a)  General rule.  For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime is inadmissible except when the crime is one involving dishonesty.  However, in a criminal case where the defendant takes the stand, the defendant shall not be questioned or evidence introduced as to whether the defendant has been convicted of a crime, for the sole purpose of attacking credibility, unless the defendant has oneself introduced testimony for the purpose of establishing the defendant's credibility as a witness, in which case the defendant shall be treated as any other witness as provided in this rule.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Effect of pardon.  Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this rule if the conviction has been the subject of a pardon.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Juvenile convictions.  Evidence of juvenile convictions is admissible to the same extent as are criminal convictions under subsection (a) of this rule.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Pendency of appeal.  The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible.  Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible. [L 1980, c 164, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]</P>
