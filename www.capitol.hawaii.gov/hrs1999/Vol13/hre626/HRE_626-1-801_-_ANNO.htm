</B>
<P>  This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 801(a), (b), and (c).  The substance of Fed. R. Evid. 801(d) (prior witness statements and party admissions) is treated in Rules 802.1 and 803(a) infra.</P>
<P>  Paragraph (1):  The definition of "statement" includes some nonverbal conduct as well as express oral or written assertions, see McCormick §250.  The definition expresses an important limitation, however.  A "statement" must be intended by the declarant to be an "assertion," that is, a declaration of fact or belief.  This limitation is relevant primarily to nonverbal rather than oral or written conduct.  "It can scarcely be doubted that an assertion made in words is intended by the declarant to be an assertion," Fed. R. Evid. 801, Advisory Committee's Note.</P>
<P>  The determination of intent in relation to nonverbal conduct is not always simple.  Patently assertive gestures such as nodding to signal acquiescence or, in the instance of a mute, using hand-signing offer no problem.  "[W]here the gesture or other act is done, so far as appears, solely for the purpose of expression it is on a parity...with any purely verbal statement," McCormick §250.  However, much nonverbal conduct, although tending logically to prove the actor's belief in an event or condition, is not motivated by the intent to assert that belief and should not be considered hearsay.  An example of nonassertive, non-hearsay conduct is the treatment of a patient by a physician for a particular ailment.  The physician's conduct on this occasion logically evidences his belief that the patient is so afflicted, but the intent to assert is lacking, and thus the conduct does not constitute a "statement," even though offered to prove that belief.  Other than in instances in which the assertive intent of nonverbal conduct is clear and unambiguous, the issue is properly one for preliminary determination by the court in accordance with Rule 104.</P>
<P>  Paragraph (3):  This definition of "hearsay" is identical with that contained in Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).  It is also consistent with recent expressions of the Hawaii Supreme Court, see Kekua v. Kaiser Foundation Hosp., 61 H. 208, 217, 601 P.2d 364, 370 (1979) ("Extrajudicial statements...offered in evidence for the truth of the matter asserted therein"); State v. Murphy, 59 H. 1, 16, 575 P.2d 448, 458-59 (1978).  Compare Territory v. Williams, 41 H. 348 (1956), where the statements were not offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted but rather to prove that the declarant understood the English language and the nature of an oath.  In such a case the court can minimize the danger that the trier of fact may consider the statements as proof of the matters asserted by delivering an instruction pursuant to Rule 105.</P>
<P>  Another class of non-hearsay statements is illustrated in State v. Iwasaki, 59 H. 401, 581 P.2d 1171 (1978), where the defendant was charged with managing a prostitution business.  Testimony by undercover police officers that alleged prostitutes had solicited the officers and discussed sexual activities was objected to as hearsay, but the court held that the prostitutes' statements "were [admissible as] part of the transaction constituting the alleged violation."  The court also characterized the statements as "verbal acts" and as part of the "res gestae."  To the same effect was Wilson v. Von Holt, 25 H. 529 (1920), where the conversation served to explain the purpose and nature of the delivery of a painting.  The statements, although perhaps assertive in nature, were an integral part of the transaction and thus acquired a measure of independent legal significance, similar to the words of a contract or a marriage ceremony.</P>
<P>  In determining whether or not a statement is offered "to prove the truth of the matter asserted," the proposition sought to be proved by the proponent of the statement must be evaluated.  In Kainea v. Kreuger, 31 H. 108 (1929), for example, a predecessor in possession of land had told witnesses that "the property belongs to them."  Ownership of the property was very much in question, but the proponent of the statement claimed title through adverse possession, and the statement was offered, not for the truth of the assertion, but rather to show that the declarant had given "notice to the world that the possession which he was holding was hostile to all others."  31 H. at 113.  In such cases where statements are offered to show notice, limiting instructions under Rule 105 may be in order.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Declarant's statement offered for truth of contents, not for fact that statement was made.  67 H. 499, 692 P.2d 1158.</P>
<P>  Written document, alleged contract, was not hearsay and was properly admitted into evidence by trial court.  10 H. App. 15, 859 P.2d 935.</P>
<P>  Officer’s testimony was not hearsay because it did not go to show the truth of the statement, but to establish the basis for the officer’s subsequent actions in arresting defendant.  79 H. 175 (App.), 900 P. 2d 172.</P>
<P>  Complainant's out-of-court statements not hearsay where offered by State not for their truth, but to show that police had reasonable grounds under §709-906 to issue warning citation which defendant subsequently violated.  82 H. 381 (App.), 922 P.2d 994.</P>
