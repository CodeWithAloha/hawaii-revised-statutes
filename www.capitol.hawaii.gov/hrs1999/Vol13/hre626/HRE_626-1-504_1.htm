<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A communication is "confidential" if not intended to be disclosed to third persons other than those present to further the interest of the client in the consultation, examination, or interview, or persons reasonably necessary for the transmission of the communication, or persons who are participating in the counseling or psychotherapy under the direction of the psychologist, including members of the client's family.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  General rule of privilege.  A client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications made for the purpose of counseling or psychotherapy with respect to behavioral problems, including substance addiction or abuse, among oneself, the client's psychologist, and persons who are participating in the counseling or psychotherapy under the direction of the psychologist, including members of the client's family.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Who may claim the privilege.  The privilege may be claimed by the client, the client's guardian or conservator, or the personal representative of a deceased client.

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Examination by order of court.  If the court orders an examination of the physical, mental, or emotional condition of a client, whether a party or a witness, communications made in the course thereof are not privileged under this rule with respect to the particular purpose for which the examination is ordered unless the court orders otherwise.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Condition an element of claim or defense.

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Proceedings against psychologist.  There is no privilege under this rule in any administrative or judicial proceeding in which the competency, practitioner's license, or practice of the psychologist is at issue, provided that the identifying data of the clients whose records are admitted into evidence shall be kept confidential unless waived by the client.  The administrative agency, board, or commission may close the proceeding to the public to protect the confidentiality of the client. [L 1980, c 164, pt of §1; am L 1985, c 115, §18; gen ch 1985]</P>
