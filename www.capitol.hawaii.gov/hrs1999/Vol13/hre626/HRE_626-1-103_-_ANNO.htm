<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 103 COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 103.</P>
<P>  Subsection (a):  This subsection expresses the principle that a ruling admitting or excluding evidence cannot be assigned as error unless it affects a substantial right and unless the court is clearly apprised of the nature of the claimed error and of the corrective action sought.  The objection or motion to strike, addressed to a ruling admitting evidence, and the offer of proof, directed to a ruling excluding evidence, provide the appropriate procedural mechanisms.</P>
<P>  The rule restates existing Hawaii law.  In Trask v. Kam, 44 H. 10, 22, 352 P.2d 320, 326-27 (1959), the court pointed out that error in admission of testimony is not a basis for reversal absent "substantial resulting prejudice" to the rights of a party.  See Berkson v. Post, 38 H. 436 (1949); HRCP 61.</P>
<P>  In State v. Okura, 56 H. 455, 458, 541 P.2d 9, 11 (1975), the court held:  "A motion to strike must be specific; it must be directed with precision to the matter sought to be stricken and a general motion to strike all testimony must be overruled if any portion of that testimony is admissible."  There is a need for a specific offer of proof, Warshaw v. Rockresorts, 57 H. 645, 651, 562 P.2d 428, 433 (1977), unless the nature of the error is clear, Territory v. Branco, 42 H. 304, 313 (1958).</P>
<P>  Subsection (b):  This subsection generally restates relevant provisions of HRCP 43(c).  The intent is to provide the appellate court with a record adequate for final disposition of an evidentiary point.  The provision is discretionary rather than mandatory, leaving determination of adequacy of record to the judgment of the trial court.</P>
<P>  Subsection (c):  This provision recognizes that an exclusionary ruling may be nullified if the evidence sought to be excluded is brought to the attention of the jury either through an offer of proof or other means.  Cf. Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968); HRCP 43(c).</P>
<P>  Subsection (d):  This provision resembles HRCrP 52(b):  "Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court."  Cf. Lindeman v. Raynor, 43 H. 299, 303 (1959):  "[E]ven without objection the court may reject improper evidence."</P>

</B>
<P>  Where plaintiffs’ counsel did not object to defendant’s expert’s testimony until after expert had been questioned on direct examination, cross-examination, and redirect examination, and no motion to strike expert’s testimony was made until two days later, after defense had already rested its case and the court had already determined the instructions to be submitted to jury, plaintiffs’ objection to expert’s testimony was untimely and was thus waived for appeal purposes.  77 H. 446 (App.), 887 P.2d 656.</P>
<P>  Chemist's testimony regarding net weight of cocaine improperly admitted where prosecution failed to lay proper foundation that balance was in proper working order such that weight measured by balance could be relied upon as substantive fact.  80 H. 382, 910 P.2d 695.</P>
<P>  Where objection to officer's testimony regarding gross weight of cocaine did not challenge accuracy of certified gram scale, issue of accuracy of scale waived.  80 H. 382, 910 P.2d 695.</P>
<P>  Mentioned:  74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.</P>
