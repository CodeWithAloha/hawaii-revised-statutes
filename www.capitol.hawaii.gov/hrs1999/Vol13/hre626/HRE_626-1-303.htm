<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>Rule 303  Presumptions imposing burden of producing evidence. </B> (a)  General rule.  A presumption established to implement no public policy other than to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of producing evidence.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Effect.  The effect of a presumption imposing the burden of producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence, in which case no instruction on presumption shall be given and the trier of fact shall determine the existence or nonexistence of the presumed fact from the evidence and without regard to the presumption.  Nothing in this rule shall be construed to prevent the drawing of any inferences.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Presumptions.  The following presumptions, and all other presumptions established by law that fall within the criteria of subsection (a) of this rule, are presumptions imposing the burden of producing evidence:</P><DIR>
