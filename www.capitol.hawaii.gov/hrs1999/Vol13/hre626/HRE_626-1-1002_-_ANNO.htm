</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 1002 except that "statute" is substituted for "Act of Congress."  Rule 1002 states the so-called "best evidence rule," requiring the production of the original document whenever the proponent seeks to prove the document's contents.  See, e.g., Ripley v. Kapiolani Estate, 22 H. 86 (1914).  The present rule applies this requirement to writings, recordings, and photographs as those terms are defined in Rule 1001.</P>
<P>  Note that this rule applies only when the effort is to "prove the content of a writing."  The Advisory Committee's Note to Fed. R. Evid. 1002 addresses this point:  "Thus an event may be proved by nondocumentary evidence, even though a written record of it was made.  If, however, the event is sought to be proved by the written record, the rule applies.  For example, payment may be proved without producing the written receipt which was given.  Earnings may be proved without producing books of account in which they are entered."  Cf. Brown v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 14 H. 80 (1902).</P>
