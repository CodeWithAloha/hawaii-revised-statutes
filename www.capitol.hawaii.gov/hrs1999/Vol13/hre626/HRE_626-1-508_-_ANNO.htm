<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">RULE 508 COMMENTARY</P>
</B>
<B><P>  </B>This rule is similar to Uniform Rule of Evidence 507.  Unlike the other privileges in this section, the rule provides a qualified right against disclosure, subject to broad judicial discretion.  Hawaii courts have not addressed the issue at the appellate level; however, HRCP 26(c)(7) provides qualified protection against such disclosure during pre-trial discovery, investing the court with discretion to order "that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way."  This rule extends that protection to the trial stage.</P>
