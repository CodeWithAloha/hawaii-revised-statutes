<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§671-3  Informed consent; board of medical examiners standards.</B>  (a)  The board of medical examiners, insofar as practicable, shall establish standards for health care providers to follow in giving information to a patient, or to a patient's guardian if the patient is not competent to give an informed consent, to ensure that the patient's consent to treatment is an informed consent.  The standards may include the substantive content of the information to be given, the manner in which the information is to be given by the health care provider and the manner in which consent is to be given by the patient or the patient's guardian.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If the standards established by the board of medical examiners include provisions which are designed to reasonably inform a patient, or a patient's guardian, of:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The condition being treated;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The nature and character of the proposed treatment or surgical procedure;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The anticipated results;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The recognized possible alternative forms of treatment; and</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The recognized serious possible risks, complications, and anticipated benefits involved in the treatment or surgical procedure, and in the recognized possible alternative forms of treatment, including nontreatment,</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>then the standards shall be admissible as evidence of the standard of care required of the health care providers.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  On or before January&nbsp;1, 1984, the board of medical examiners shall establish standards for health care providers to follow in giving information to a patient or a patient's guardian, to ensure that the patient's consent to the performance of a mastectomy is an informed consent.  The standards shall include the substantive content of the information to be given, the manner in which the information is to be given by the health care provider and the manner in which consent is to be given by the patient or the patient's guardian.  The substantive content of the information to be given shall include information on the recognized alternative forms of treatment.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Nothing in this section shall require informed consent from a patient or a patient's guardian when emergency treatment or emergency surgical procedure is rendered by a health care provider and the obtaining of consent is not reasonably feasible under the circumstances without adversely affecting the condition of the patient's health.
