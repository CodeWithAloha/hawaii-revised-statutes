</B>
<P>  Where provision of insurance policy was an agreement to submit any dispute regarding property value and amount of loss to appraisal panel at request of either party, and panel's decision was to be binding on both parties, the provision constituted an agreement to arbitrate as Hawaii case law developed; as an arbitration agreement pursuant to Hawaii state law, the provision fell squarely within scope of Federal Arbitration Act.  904 F. Supp. 1142.</P>
<P>  Non-judicial modification of original arbitration award violated chapter.  73 H. 201, 830 P.2d 503.</P>
<P>  To change award under this chapter, party must timely move to vacate under §658-9 or modify or correct under §658-10.  74 H. 210, 847 P.2d 652.</P>
<P>  In light of legislative intent of this chapter, circuit court had no jurisdiction to consolidate arbitrations where arbitration agreements were silent as to consolidation.  77 H. 481, 889 P.2d 58.</P>
<P>  Discussed:  87 H. 136 (App.), 952 P.2d 893.</P>
