Where a subpoena is served in behalf of the State or any county by a nonsalaried subordinate of the sheriff or chief of police, the regular fee for such service shall be payable to such subordinate.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit the police commission of any county from requiring all such fees, mileage, and expenses to be paid into a police benefit fund.
