</B>
<P>  Comparative negligence doctrine will not be applied to claims accruing before July&nbsp;14, 1969.  51 H. 636, 466 P.2d 429.  Comparative negligence applies only to claims accruing after July&nbsp;14, 1969, and the rule of contributory negligence continues on claims that accrued before that date.  52 H. 129, 471 P.2d 524.</P>
<P>  Contributory negligence is available as defense against claims accruing before July&nbsp;14, 1969.  55 H. 375, 520 P.2d 62.</P>
<P>  Evidence relating to degree of fault of nonparty litigant should not be presented to diminish plaintiff's verdict.  56 H. 598, 546 P.2d 527.</P>
<P>  Costs allowable to prevailing party not subject to reduction in proportion to negligence attributable.  56 H. 613, 546 P.2d 1013.</P>
<P>  Prior law.  "Negligence of the person against whom recovery is sought" means aggregate negligence of defendants.  64 H. 401, 642 P.2d 930.</P>
<P>  Section does not affect action between two joint tortfeasors under sections 663-11 to 17.  65 H. 428, 653 P.2d 96.</P>
<P>  Comparative negligence principles not applicable to strict liability case.  69 H. 176, 738 P.2d 79.</P>
<P>  Contributory negligence is no longer a complete defense or total bar to a tort claim; legislature, in enacting comparative negligence statute did not intend to alter judicially created derivative action for loss of consortiums.  69 H. 192, 738 P.2d 85.</P>
<P>  Pure comparative negligence principles apply to strict products liability claims.  69 H. 232, 738 P.2d 416.</P>
<P>  Section required that judgment be entered for defendant where jury's special verdict apportioned greater fault to victim than to defendant.  87 H. 265, 954 P.2d 644.</P>
<P>  Instructions to jury.  1 H. App 94, 614 P.2d 402.</P>
<P>  Comparative negligence and products liability doctrines merged; in products liability case injured plaintiff cannot recover if more negligent than defendant.  6 H. App. 652, 736 P.2d 440.</P>
<P>  Because this section clearly permits apportionment of damages and no justification exists to maintain doctrine of last clear chance, use of doctrine by a plaintiff abolished.  83 H. 78 (App.), 924 P.2d 572.</P>
<P>  Trial court should have instructed jury on law of comparative negligence and failure to do so made jury instructions that were given prejudicially insufficient.  83 H. 78 (App.), 924 P.2d 572.</P>
<P>  Cited:  60 H. 381, 590 P.2d 564.</P>
