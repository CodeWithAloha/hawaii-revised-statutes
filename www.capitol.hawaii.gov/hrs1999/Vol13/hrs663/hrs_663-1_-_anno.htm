</B><P>  Intervening negligence and proximate causation.  45 H. 128, 363 P.2d 969.</P>
<P>  Negligence.  Causation construed.  57 H. 460, 558 P.2d 1018.</P>
<P>  Where causation is a primary issue, it is plain and reversible error for a trial court not to explain the meaning of "legal cause" to a jury.   77 H. 282, 884 P.2d 345.</P>
<P>  When read as a whole, or when considering both jury instruction where trial court used term "legal cause" as opposed to "substantial factor" and instruction that properly defined "legal cause", the instructions given were not prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.  78 H. 230, 891 P.2d 1022.</P>
<P>  In breach of express warranty actions based on seller's failure to deliver goods in conformance with an express promise, affirmation of fact, or description, "substantial factor" test proper standard to apply in determining proximate cause.  86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.</P>

<B><P>Damages.</P>
</B><P>  Defendant insurance company's motion for summary judgment granted as to plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, where plaintiff alleged that defendant's conduct was wanton and oppressive; there was not sufficient evidence to reach clear and convincing standard, and thus the question of punitives could not be put to a jury.  999 F. Supp. 1369.</P>
<P>  If plaintiff succeeded on bad faith claim, and plaintiff could show that plaintiff's emotional distress damages were proximately caused by defendant insurance company's actions, plaintiff could recover damages for plaintiff's emotional distress as incidentally flowing from the breach.   999 F. Supp. 1369.</P>
<P>  Where court construed plaintiff's claim as one for tortious breach of contract, as court could not identify a breach of contract, it necessarily followed that there was no material issue of fact whether defendant's alleged breach of contract was sufficiently "wanton or reckless" to justify recovery for tortious breach.  11 F. Supp. 2d 1204.  </P>
<P>  Punitive damages not allowed against principal unless principal participated in the wrongful act or authorized or approved it.  8 H. 411; 24 H. 579; 29 H. 524.  Punitive damages may be awarded though actual damages nominal.  40 H. 492.</P>

<P>  Use of mathematical formula to compute damages for pain and suffering improper.  47 H. 408, 390 P.2d 740; 48 H. 22, 395 P.2d 365.  But see §635-52.</P>
<P>  Defendant title company was liable to plaintiffs only for damages limited to the transaction for which certificate of title search was intended to influence, that is, only for damages plaintiffs suffered in the transaction wherein they purchased the property; defendant’s negligence was not the proximate cause of the loss of anticipated profits.  51 H. 462, 462 P.2d 905.</P>
<P>  Clear and convincing standard of proof adopted for all punitive damage claims.  71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.</P>
<P>  Punitive damages may be awarded in products liability action based on underlying theory of strict liability where plaintiff proves requisite aggravating conduct on part of defendant.  71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff has duty to mitigate damages.  56 H. 507, 542 P.2d 1265.</P>
<P>  Mental distress damages may be recovered in a products liability implied warranty action.  74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.</P>
<P>  Apportionment of damages, discussed, where plaintiff had a pre-existing condition, had been injured or plaintiff’s condition had been aggravated by independent acts of successive tortfeasors, and had allegedly caused some of plaintiff’s own injuries after the accident from which plaintiff had brought suit.  77 H. 282, 884 P.2d 345.</P>
<P>  Circuit court correctly granted plaintiff-appellee’s motion for directed verdict as to punitive damages regarding interference with contract claim, where defendants-appellants failed to show actual damages.  78 H. 40, 890 P.2d 277.</P>
<P>  Punitive damages may not be awarded in bad faith tort case unless evidence reflects something more than the conduct necessary to establish the tort.  82 H. 120, 920 P.2d 334.</P>
<P>  Emotional distress damages resulting from breach of contract recoverable only where parties specifically provide for them in the contract or where the nature of the contract clearly indicates that such damages are within the parties’ contemplation or expectation in the event of a breach.  89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707.</P>
<P>  Tort recovery, including recovery of punitive damages, is not allowed under Hawaii law for breach of contract in the absence of conduct that (1) violates a duty that is independently recognized by principles of tort law and (2) transcends the breach of the contract.  89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff alleging defamation failed to prove "actual damages" caused by newspaper’s negligence, summary judgment for newspaper properly granted.  89 H. 254, 971 P.2d 1089.</P>
<P>  Inconsistent for jury not to award pain and suffering general damages where it awarded special damages for medical expenses and lost wages.  80 H. 188 (App.), 907 P.2d 774.</P>
<P>  "Pure" comparative negligence principles should be applied to reduce a plaintiff's recovery in those tort actions for breach of express warranty where a plaintiff is found to be negligent.  86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.</P>

<B><P>Defamation.</P>
</B><P>  Defendants' statements implying attorney's poor client representation constitutionally protected speech and not defamatory where general and specific contexts in which statements were made did not imply assertion of an objective fact and statements were incapable of being proved true or false.  56 F.3d 1147.</P>
<P>  False statement that attorney had been a prosecutor in South Africa was libelous per se; no recovery for defamation based on a truthful statement of fact.  825 F. Supp. 906.</P>
<P>  Some statements that allegedly defamed plaintiff or cast plaintiff in false light were privileged expressions of opinion.  825 F. Supp. 906.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff was not a public figure for purposes of its defamation claim.  833 F. Supp. 802.</P>
<P>  Statements in editorial about plaintiff (when plaintiff was mayor) were protected by First Amendment and thus, not actionable.  930 F. Supp. 1403.</P>
<P>  Where alleged defamatory statements occurred during a conversation between an employee of defendant and representatives of defendant's temporary disability insurer, there was a qualified privilege as defendant and its insurer shared a common interest, their business relationship; an employer who communicates information to its insurance carrier is acting, at the very least, to promote the private interest of the companies; questions remained regarding potential abuse of the privilege.  26 F. Supp. 2d 1241.  Public official.  50 H. 648, 448 P.2d 337.</P>
<P>  Qualified privilege; publication.  52 H. 366, 477 P.2d 162.</P>
<P>  Libel per se; qualified privilege.  53 H. 456, 497 P.2d 40.</P>
<P>  Broadcast charging falsely that person is communist is libel per se.  56 H. 522, 543 P.2d 1356.</P>
<P>  Qualified privilege discussed.  57 H. 390, 557 P.2d 1334.</P>
<P>  Trial court clearly erred, to defendant's prejudice, by leaving to jury determination of existence of a qualified privilege.  76 H. 310, 876 P.2d 1278.</P>
<P>  Defendant’s statement not false or defamatory where statement was rhetorical hyperbole--figurative or hyperbolic language that would negate the impression that defendant was asserting an objective fact about plaintiff; statement thus was constitutionally protected.  88 H. 94, 962 P.2d 353.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff in defamation action failed to prove that newspaper had acted with actual malice when it erroneously published story naming plaintiff as the target of an investigation, summary judgment for newspaper properly granted.  89 H. 254, 971 P.2d 1089.</P>

<B><P>Defenses.</P>
</B><P>  Fact that manufacturers of blood clotting agent followed industry standards in negligence action by hemophiliac patients who tested positive for HIV did not necessarily immunize defendants from liability.  971 F.2d 375.</P>
<P>  Where defendant contended that claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of limitations governing damage to persons and property (§657-7), since there is no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a "personal injury", and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is found in the catchall provision of §657-1 (§657-1(4)).  986 F. Supp. 1334.</P>
<P>  It could not be disputed that by the time the underinsured motorist benefits were paid, plaintiff either knew or should have known that defendant's alleged refusal to engage in settlement negotiations caused plaintiff injury; any claims for emotional distress were time-barred.  11 F. Supp. 2d 1204.</P>
<P>  Limitations period applicable to cause of action for bad faith, discussed; where complaint was not filed until almost one year after the limitations period had lapsed, to the extent that complaint alleged a claim for the tort of bad faith denial of benefits, summary judgment granted in favor of defendant as to plaintiff's claim for tort of bad faith.  11 F. Supp. 2d 1204.  </P>
<P>  Contributory negligence.  48 H. 22, 395 P.2d 365.  Assumption of risk.  49 H. 1, 406 P.2d 887; 49 H. 351, 417 P.2d 816. Unavoidable accident.  47 H. 408, 390 P.2d 740; 48 H. 330, 402 P.2d 289.</P>
<P>  Comparative negligence applies only to claims accruing after July 14, 1969, and the rule of contributory negligence continues on claims that accrued before that date.  52 H. 129, 471 P.2d 524.</P>
<P>  Interspousal tort immunity upheld.  63 H. 653, 634 P.2d 586.</P>
<P>  In implied warranty and strict products liability tort actions, express assumption of risk is available as separate defense that may bar recovery; implied assumption of risk is defense only when plaintiff's assumption of risk is a form of contributory negligence.  74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.</P>
<P>  Assumption of risk defense generally applied to tort claims for relief.  74 H. 85, 839 P.2d 10.</P>

<B><P>Duty.</P>
</B><P>  Plaintiff failed to demonstrate facts to establish duty owed by defendant, where, inter alia, no evidence found of custody or control of plaintiff's employer's machinery or employees that would create special relationship between defendant and plaintiff's employer or plaintiff.  863 F. Supp. 1193.</P>
<P>  In case arising out of alleged assault on airplane, tort claim for breach of duty of reasonable care preempted by Airlines Deregulation Act.  905 F. Supp. 823.</P>
<P>  Evidence demonstrated that plaintiffs had never had a relationship with defendant; without a relationship between plaintiffs and defendant, there could be no legal duty.  920 F. Supp. 1080.</P>
<P>  Defendant did not owe plaintiffs a duty to deny doctor hospital privileges, where defendant could not reasonably foresee that plaintiff would be injured as a result of doctor's performance of plaintiff's hip revision surgery.   985 F. Supp. 1241.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiffs asserted cause of action against defendant for negligent supervision, contending that based on defendant's knowledge of doctor's prior substance abuse, defendant had a duty to supervise doctor's surgical procedures, defendant did not have a duty to specifically supervise doctor's surgical procedures, as opposed to any other physician on its medical staff.   985 F. Supp. 1241.</P>
<P>  Defendant, which acted as custodian, granted summary judgment on counts where plaintiff alleged that defendant acted in a negligent or grossly negligent manner by permitting securities to be substituted into custodial account and by releasing cash as alleged.   30 F. Supp. 2d 1255.</P>

<P>  Section 281-78(a)(2)(A) (1989) imposes a duty to innocent third parties upon a liquor licensee who sells alcohol to a minor; the duty includes the situation where an innocent third party has been injured by an intoxicated minor other than the minor to whom the liquor was sold, subject to determinations by the trier of fact on the issue of reasonable foreseeability.  76 H. 137, 870 P.2d 1281.</P>
<P>  Circuit court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment where plaintiff was a business visitor of hotel and there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding issue of reasonable foreseeability.  79 H. 110, 899 P.2d 393.</P>
<P>  Insurer has legal duty, implied in first-and third-party insurance contracts, to act in good faith in dealing with insured; breach of that duty gives rise to independent tort cause of action.  82 H. 120, 920 P.2d 334.</P>
<P>  Plaintiff's allegations stated a claim that potentially could warrant relief under a theory based on duty by defendant wife to refrain from conduct that would create an unreasonable risk of harm to another through husband's conduct.  82 H. 293, 922 P.2d 347.</P>
<P>  Where deceased was not in the custody of defendant, a special relationship did not exist to impose a duty on defendant to prevent deceased's suicide.  83 H. 154, 925 P.2d 324.</P>
<P>  Manufacturer not negligent in failing to warn of "blind zone" danger where danger involved in using straddle carrier was obvious and apparent, discernible by casual inspection, and generally known and recognized.  85 H. 336, 944 P.2d 1279.</P>
<P>  Manufacturers are not subject in Hawaii to an independent, continuing duty to retrofit its products, subsequent to their manufacture and sale, with post-manufacture safety devices that were unavailable at the time of manufacture.  85 H. 336, 944 P.2d 1279.</P>
<P>  No duty by insurance agent to advise insured of option to stack coverage where no evidence agent had informed insureds in the past of changes in insurance laws such that insured would rely on agent to inform them of changes in available coverage without their inquiry.  87 H. 307, 955 P.2d 100.</P>
<P>  As dangers of riding unrestrained in open cargo bed of pickup truck are obvious and generally known to ordinary user, truck manufacturer had no duty to warn potential passengers of those dangers.  87 H. 413, 958 P.2d 535.</P>
<P>  Hawaii civil rights commission is subject to a duty to follow its own administrative rules, utilizing reasonable care, and was potentially negligent for instituting legal action barred by its own administrative rules.  88 H. 85, 962 P.2d 344.</P>
<P>  Where police department did not have "special relationship" with victim, department did not have duty to protect victim or victim’s parents from harm caused by assailant.  89 H. 315, 972 P.2d 1081.</P>
<P>  Non-liquor licensee social host does not have non-statutory tort law duty to protect third persons from risks of personal injury and/or property damage caused when certain events occur in certain sequence.  9 H. App. 490, 851 P.2d 332.</P>
<P>  Because of the obvious danger to young children, it was unreasonable to require that swimming pool manufacturer furnish labels with its pools warning of that danger; swimming pool manufacturer’s duty to put a safe product on the market includes duty to take such measures in manufacturing and marketing the pool as will reasonably protect against injury to young children arising from their use of the pool.  10 H. App. 547, 879 P.2d 572.</P>
<P>  An accountant may be held liable to third parties under §552(2) of Restatement of Torts for negligence in the preparation of an audit report.  86 H. 301 (App.), 949 P.2d 141.</P>

<B><P>Landowner.</P>
</B><P>  Liability of wife who is joint owner of land with husband for collapse of retaining wall.  47 H. 149, 384 P.2d 303.</P>

<P>  Occupier of land--extent of duty to warn of dangers on premises.  60 H. 32, 586 P.2d 1037.</P>
<P>  If a condition exists upon land which poses an unreasonable risk of harm to persons using the land, then the possessor of the land, if the possessor knows, or should have known of the unreasonable risk, owes a duty to persons using the land to take reasonable steps to eliminate the unreasonable risk, or adequately to warn users against it.  70 H. 415, 772 P.2d 693.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiff was injured on motocross track, an area of raceway park not thrown open for admission of the public, Restatement (Second) of Torts §359 could not be a basis for lessor’s liability; lessor not liable under Restatement (Second) of Torts §358, where plaintiffs failed to adduce any facts demonstrating that lessees or sublessees did not know or have reason to know track’s lighting was dangerously inadequate.  76 H. 77, 869 P.2d 216.</P>
<P>  Continuing-tort exception, which tolls running of statute of limitations under §662-4, adopted; thus, where an actor continuously diverts water over which he or she has direct control onto another’s land, and the diversion causes continuous and substantial damage to that person’s property and the actor knows of this damage, such an act may present evidence of a continuous tort.  88 H. 241 (App.), 965 P.2d 783.</P>

<P>  In actions for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment, district court conviction conclusively establishes probable cause even if conviction is reversed.  56 H. 383, 538 P.2d 320.</P>
<P>  Appellants’ state tort claims for false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution failed as a matter of law because appellants did not contest the preliminary hearing determination of probable cause and their commitment to circuit court for trial.  Appellants failed to cite to any persuasive or relevant authority in support of their contention that where actions or inactions of the prosecutor subsequent to a preliminary hearing "erodes" probable cause, an action for false arrest, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution arises.  76 H. 219, 873 P.2d 98.</P>

<P>  Where insured’s bad faith claim was not "any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing" under §658-5, and action for bad faith in the first-party insurance context is independent of the policy, an ongoing appraisal process did not bar insured from bringing a lawsuit alleging bad faith handling of insured’s claim.  88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d 639.</P>
