Supp. 593.</P>
<P>  Party was not allowed to recover as a joint tortfeasor.  682 F. Supp. 1499.</P>

<P>  A party who settles before suit and is found not negligent in action for contribution is not a joint tortfeasor and is therefore not entitled to contribution but may recover under subrogation.  53 H. 398, 495 P.2d 585.</P>

<P>  When conduct of all joint tortfeasors is not sufficiently culpable to justify award of punitive damages against each tortfeasor, such damages may not be the subject of contribution among joint tortfeasors.  87 H. 273 (App.), 954 P.2d 652.</P>
