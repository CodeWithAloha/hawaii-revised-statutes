It may enter an amended or modified judgment, order, or decree, or may remand the case to the trial court for the entry of the same or for other or further proceedings, as in its opinion the facts and law warrant.  Any judgment, order or decree entered by the supreme court may be enforced by it or remitted for enforcement by the trial court.</P>
<P>&#9;Every appeal shall be taken on the record and no new evidence shall be introduced in the supreme court.  The supreme court may correct any error appearing on the record, but need not consider a point which was not presented in the trial court in an appropriate manner.  No judgment, order or decree shall be reversed, amended or modified for any error or defect unless the court is of the opinion that it has injuriously affected the substantial rights of the appellant.
