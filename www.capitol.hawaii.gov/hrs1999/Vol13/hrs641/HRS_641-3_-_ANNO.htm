Appeals from judgment in habeas corpus proceedings stay execution.  13 H. 534; 19 H. 346; 26 H. 701.  While supersedeas operates, statute of limitations suspended.  20 H. 370.  An abortive appeal, until disposed of, operates as a supersedeas.  20 H. 370.  Re stay pending interlocutory appeal.  26 H. 69.  That part of section permitting execution to issue pending appeal does not apply to district court cases wherein jury trial is demandable of right.  14 H. 524.  But see 15 H. 590, where amendment to statute was upheld and execution ordered to issue in accordance therewith.  Executions pending appeal apply to proceedings for summary possession as well as to other proceedings and cannot issue unless upon good cause shown and an opportunity to file supersedeas bond.  15 H. 624.  In cases other than for the nonpayment of rent, an appeal from a judgment of summary possession does not operate as a supersedeas.  27 H. 362.

Effect of appeal on sequestration:  33 H. 725; appeal as stay, 33 H. 911.</P>
