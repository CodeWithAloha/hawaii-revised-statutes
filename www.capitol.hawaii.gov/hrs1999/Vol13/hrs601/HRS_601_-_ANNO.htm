<P>  Pursuant to Article VI, Section 7 of the State Constitution, the Supreme Court has promulgated rules having the force and effect of law.  Statutes relating to process, practice, procedure and appeals remain in force and effect if, but only if, they are not in conflict with the rules of court.  Accordingly, the procedural statutes set out in this division should be compared with the rules of court to ascertain whether they have been superseded in whole or in part.  As to applicability of rules, see HRCP rules 1 and 81; HRPP rules 1 and 54; RCC rules 32 and 34; HAR rule 2; RDC rules 31 and 32; DCRCP rules 1 and 81; RSCD rule 1; HFCR rules 1 and 81; HRAP rules 1 and 49; see also Rules of the Supreme Court, Code of Professional Responsibility, Code of Judicial Conduct, Rules of the Intermediate Court of Appeals, Rules of the Tax Appeal Court, and Rules of the Land Court.</P>
