The ordinances should include provisions for permitting an appropriate number of unrelated persons with developmental disabilities and two supervisory staff to reside in a single-family dwelling provided that in determining the appropriate number, the political subdivisions should consider the cost of maintenance and construction of the residence, in order that financial obligations can be met.
