Disclosure of health information in the form of nonidentifiable health information shall not be construed as a disclosure of protected health information.</P>
<P>(b)  For the purpose of treatment or qualified health care operations, an entity may only use or disclose protected health information within the entity if the use or disclosure is properly noticed pursuant to sections 323C-13 and 323C-22.  For all other uses and disclosures, an entity may only use or disclose protected health information, if the use or disclosure is properly consented to pursuant to section 323C-23.  Disclosure to agents of an entity described in subsection (a) shall be considered as a disclosure within an entity.</P>
<P>(c)  If an individual does not want protected health information released pursuant to [subsection] (b), the individual shall advise the provider prior to the delivery of services that the relevant protected health information shall not be disclosed pursuant to subsection (b), and the individual shall pay the health care provider directly for health care services.  A health plan may decline to cover particular health care services if an individual has refused to allow the release of protected health care information pertaining to those particular health care services.  Protected health information related to health care services paid for directly by the individual shall not be disclosed without consent.</P>
