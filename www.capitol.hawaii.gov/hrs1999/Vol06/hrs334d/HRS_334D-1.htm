<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§334D-1]</B> <B> Findings and purpose.</B>  Nursing is a stressful occupation and some nurses may be tempted to escape the pressures of their job by consuming alcohol or taking drugs.  Many times nurses do not realize that they have developed a chemical dependency problem, and that they need help before the problem gets worse.  </P>
<P>&#9;The legislature finds that there is no formal peer program to assist nurses who have developed a chemical dependency problem.  There is, however, an informal peer program operated by the Hawaii Nurses Association.  This is a peer assistance program for nurses who have not been reported to the department of commerce and consumer affairs because of a chemical dependency problem.  The diversion program created by this chapter is a component of the Hawaii Nurses Association's peer assistance program, and is intended for nurses who have been reported to the department of commerce and consumer affairs.</P>
<P>&#9;The purpose of this chapter is to establish a diversion program for nurses with chemical dependency problems and to place the program under the auspices of the board of nursing for oversight purposes.  It is the intent of this chapter that nurses who are abiding by the terms and conditions of the diversion program shall not be subject to further disciplinary action for their chemical dependency problems by the board of nursing.
