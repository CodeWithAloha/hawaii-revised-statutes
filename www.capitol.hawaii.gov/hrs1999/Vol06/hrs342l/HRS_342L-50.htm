<P>&#9;"Exposure assessment" means a determination regarding the extent of exposure of, or potential for exposure of, individuals to petroleum from a release from an underground storage tank or tank system.  This assessment shall be based on factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, the existence of or potential for pathways of human exposure (including ground or surface water contamination, air emissions, dermal exposure, soil ingestion, and food chain contamination), the size of the community or communities within the likely pathways of exposure, an analysis of expected human exposure levels with respect to short-term and long-term health effects associated with identified contaminants, and any available recommended exposure or tolerance limits for the contaminants.</P>
<P>&#9;"Facility" means, with respect to any owner or operator, a single parcel of property (or any contiguous or adjacent property), including improvements, in or upon which all underground storage tanks or tank systems used for the storage of petroleum that are owned or operated by the owner or operator are located.</P>
<P>&#9;"Fund" means the leaking underground storage tank fund.</P>
<P>&#9;"Owner" means any person who falls within the definition of owner contained within part I but excluding a person who does not participate in the management of an underground storage tank or tank system and is otherwise not engaged in petroleum production, refining, and marketing but holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in the tank or tank system.
