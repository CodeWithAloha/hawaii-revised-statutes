<P>&#9;The department shall assign priority in undertaking response actions, pursuant to this subsection, to cases in which the department cannot identify, within the time necessary to protect human health or the environment, a solvent owner or operator of the tank or tank system, or even if able to identify such a person, has cause to believe that the person cannot or will not properly undertake a response action.</P>

<P>&#9;The department shall assign priority in undertaking response actions pursuant to this subsection and in issuing orders requiring owners or operators to undertake response actions to those cases involving releases of petroleum from underground storage tanks or tank systems that pose the greatest threat to human health or the environment.</P>

<P>&#9;(d)  Response actions undertaken by the department may include the temporary or permanent relocation of residents and the provision of alternative household water supplies.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  In connection with the performance of any response action, the department may undertake an exposure assessment.  A response action to abate immediate hazards or reduce exposure shall not be delayed in order to complete any exposure assessment.  The costs of any such assessment may be deemed to have been incurred in undertaking the response action.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Except as provided in this subsection, in order to protect human life, at any facility whose owner or operator has failed to maintain evidence of financial responsibility in amounts at least equal to the amounts established pursuant to section 342L-36, the department shall expend no moneys from the fund to respond to releases at the facility pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).  At these facilities the department may use the authority provided in this chapter to order a response action to these releases.  The department may use moneys from the fund to take a response action if necessary to protect human health at these facilities and shall seek full recovery of the costs of all such actions.  Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the department from taking a response action at a facility where there is no solvent owner or operator or where immediate action is necessary to respond to an imminent and substantial endangerment of human health or the environment.
