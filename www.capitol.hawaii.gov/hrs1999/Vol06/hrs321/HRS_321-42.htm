This assistance may consist of furnishing statistical information on the incidence or prevalence of tumors of various kinds in the State.  Other assistance, such as clerical or stenographic help, may be furnished as needed.  In all activities under this section, the department may consult and cooperate with the Hawaii state medical association and the Hawaii cancer society.</P>
<P>&#9;Insofar as is needed the department may assist tumor clinics or private physicians in the follow-up of tumor cases for the purpose of determining the progress of the disease or for further treatment.  This part of the program shall be limited to those cases on which follow-up is requested by the attending physicians, and it shall also be limited by the funds which are provided for this purpose.
