<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§328-16  Drugs limited to dispensing on prescription.</B>  (a)  A prescription drug shall be dispensed only if its label bears the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The name, business address, and telephone number of the seller.  The business address shall be the physical location of the pharmacy or the dispensing practitioner's office;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The name of the person for whom the drug was prescribed or the name of the owner of the animal for which the drug was prescribed;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The serial number of the prescription;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The date of the prescription or of its filling;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The name of the practitioner if the seller is not the practitioner;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The name, strength, and quantity of the drug;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;The date the potency of the drug expires if the date is available from the manufacturer or principal labeler;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;The number of refills available, if any; and</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;Specific directions for the drug's use; provided that if the specific directions for use are too lengthy for inclusion on the label, the notation "take according to written instructions" may be used if separate written instructions for use are actually issued with the drug by the practitioner or the pharmacist, but in no event shall the notation "take as directed," referring to oral instructions, be considered acceptable.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>If any prescription for the drug does not indicate the number of times it may be refilled, if any, the pharmacist shall not refill that prescription unless the pharmacist is subsequently authorized to do so by the practitioner.  The act of dispensing a drug other than a professional sample contrary to this subsection shall be deemed to be an act that results in a drug being misbranded while held for sale.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  In addition to the requirements enumerated in subsection (a), a prescription drug shall be dispensed only:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;By a pharmacist or a pharmacy intern upon a written prescription from a practitioner or an out-of-state practitioner as provided in section 328-17.6; provided that all valid written prescriptions shall include the following information:</P><DIR>

<P>(E)&#9;The name and address of the person for whom the prescription was written or the name of the owner of the animal for which the drug was prescribed, unless the pharmacy filling the prescription has the address on file;</P>
<P>(F)&#9;The room number and route of administration, if the patient is in an institutional facility; and</P>
<P>(G)&#9;The number of allowable refills, if the prescription is refillable.  If the number of refills authorized by the practitioner is indicated using the terms "as needed" or "prn", the prescription may be refilled up to twelve months from the date the original prescription was written.  After the twelve-month period, the "as needed" or "prn" prescription may be refilled for a subsequent three-month period; provided:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(i)&#9;The prescription is refilled only once during the three-month period;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&#9;The refill does not exceed a thirty-day supply of the drug;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&#9;The refill does not provide any amount of the drug fifteen months beyond the date the original prescription was written; and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&#9;The provisions listed in this subparagraph shall apply only to pharmacies practicing in the State.</P></DIR>

</DIR>

<P>(B)&#9;The prescriptions and records described in subparagraph (A) shall be subject to the inspection of the department or its agents at all times; and</P>
<P>(C)&#9;The department of health assigns the oral code designation to the practitioner;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(3)&#9;By a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, to an ultimate user; provided that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(A)&#9;The practitioner shall promptly record in the practitioner's records:</P><DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  For the purposes of this section, a "prescription drug" is a drug intended for use by a person which:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Is a habit forming drug to which section 328-15(4) applies;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Because of its toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its use, is not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Is limited by an approved application under section 505 of the Federal Act or section 328-17 to use under the professional supervision of a practitioner.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(f)  A drug which is subject to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be deemed to be misbranded if at any time prior to dispensing its label fails to bear the statement "Caution:  Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription," or "Caution:  State law prohibits dispensing without prescription."  A drug to which subsections (a) and (b) of this section do not apply shall be deemed to be misbranded if at any time prior to dispensing its label bears the caution statement quoted in the preceding sentence.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement, prescribed by or under authority of law with respect to drugs now included or which may hereafter be included within the classifications of narcotic drugs or marijuana as defined in the applicable federal and state laws relating to narcotic drugs and marijuana.
