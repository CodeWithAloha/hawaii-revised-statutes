<P>&#9;Sick leave allowances for firefighters shall be recorded and administered on a calendar year basis, the allowance accruing during each calendar year being credited to firefighters as of December&nbsp;31 of each year.  The sick leave provided for in this section, which is not used by a firefighter during the year in which it accrues shall accumulate and be available for use in succeeding years.</P>
<P>&#9;A licensed physician's certificate shall be required when absences are five or more consecutive days; provided the department head may investigate any absence for sickness and upon a finding that the firefighter's claim of illness was falsely made, the department head shall take proper disciplinary action in accordance with the rules governing these matters.</P>
<P>&#9;Additional sick leave with pay, in excess of that which the firefighter is entitled to, may be granted with the written approval of the governor or mayor, as the case may be; provided that due consideration shall be given to the length of service of the particular firefighter requesting an excess of that to which the firefighter is entitled.
