Further, any law to the contrary notwithstanding, in order to make optimal use of available state government resources, the governor may waive annual report requirements if information included in such reports is available in other reports and is acceptable for the purpose required or is deemed to be no longer pertinent for program reporting purposes.  If there is duplication of information in annual reports within an agency, these annual reports shall be consolidated.  In lieu of the submittal of individual annual reports by state departments, agencies, boards, or commissions, the governor may submit a consolidated annual report for the executive branch or direct the consolidation of one or more reports.  These provisions shall not preclude the legislature from requesting specific reports through concurrent resolution. [L 1961, c 42, §1; Supp, §7-46; HRS §93-12; am L 1985, c 71, §2]</P>
