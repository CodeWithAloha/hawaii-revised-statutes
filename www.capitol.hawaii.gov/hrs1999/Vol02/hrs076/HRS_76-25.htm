A person on a reemployment list shall be deemed eligible for certification to positions in the class in which the person last held a permanent status prior to separation, demotion, or reallocation.  A person may also be deemed eligible for certification to positions in a class, in the same or lower grade, which are related to the class in which the person last held a permanent appointment.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Whenever a regular employee has been laid off because the employee's position has been abolished due to lack of work or funds or because the employee was displaced by another employee because of reduction-in-force, the employee shall have the right to have the employee's name placed on appropriate recall lists and be deemed eligible for certification to positions in the class in which the employee last held permanent status or in a related class in the same or lower grade for which the employee meets the qualification requirements.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The director of human resources development may remove the name of a person on any reemployment or recall list or refuse to certify the person's name on any list of eligibles, if the director finds, after giving the person notice and an opportunity to be heard, that the person is no longer able to perform the necessary duties satisfactorily.
