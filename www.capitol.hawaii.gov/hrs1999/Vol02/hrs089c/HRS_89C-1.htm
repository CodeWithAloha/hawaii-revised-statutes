<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§89C-1  Purpose.</B>  The legislature finds that existing statutes do not permit the chief executives of the State and counties, the board of education, the board of regents, the auditor, the director of the legislative reference bureau, the ombudsman, and the chief justice of the supreme court sufficient flexibility to make appropriate and timely adjustments in the compensation, hours, terms, and conditions of employment, amounts of contributions by the State and respective counties to the Hawaii public employees health fund, and other benefits for public officers and employees who are excluded from collective bargaining coverage under  chapter 89.  To this end, the legislature grants to the respective chief executives, the board of education, the board of regents, the auditor, the director of the legislative reference bureau, the ombudsman, and the chief justice, the authority to make such adjustments for officers and employees excluded from collective bargaining in conformance with this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to interfere with or diminish any authority already provided by statutes to the chief executives, the board of education, the board of regents, the auditor, the director of the legislative reference bureau, the ombudsman, or the chief justice.
