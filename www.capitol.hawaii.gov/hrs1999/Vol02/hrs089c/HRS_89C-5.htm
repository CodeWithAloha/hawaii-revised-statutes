<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§89C-5  Implementation; effective date, appropriations, approval.</B>  (a)  Adjustments made under this chapter which do not exceed those for officers and employees in collective bargaining units shall take effect on the same dates as appropriate collective bargaining agreements.  Any such adjustments which constitute cost items shall be subject to appropriations by the appropriate legislative bodies.  Such cost items shall be submitted separately from any cost items under collective bargaining to the appropriate legislative bodies, except that if appropriation by the state legislature is required, and it is not in session at the time, such cost items shall be submitted for inclusion in the governor's next operating budget.  The state legislature or the legislative bodies of the counties acting in concert, as the case may be, may approve or reject the cost items submitted to them, as a whole.  If the state legislature or the legislative body of any county rejects any of the cost items submitted to them, all cost items shall be returned for revision.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Any other adjustments made under this chapter which constitute cost items or which were specifically provided for by legislative enactment shall be subject to approval or rejection as a whole by the appropriate legislative body.  Such adjustments for officers and employees covered under chapter 77 shall be subject to the approval or rejection as a whole by all appropriate legislative bodies acting in concert.  If the state legislature or the legislative body of any county rejects any of the adjustments submitted to it, all adjustments for officers and employees covered under chapter 77 or all adjustments for other officers and employees, as the case may be, shall be returned for revision.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The chief executives of the State or counties, the board of education, the board of regents, the auditor, the director of the legislative reference bureau, the ombudsman, or the chief justice, shall not make any adjustments nor use funds for purposes of this chapter without the prior approval of the appropriate legislative bodies as required in this section.
