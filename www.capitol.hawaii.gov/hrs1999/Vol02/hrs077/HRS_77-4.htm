Representatives of organizations representing employees and interested persons may attend and participate in the deliberations, but not vote.  The conference of personnel directors shall hold as many meetings as are necessary to accomplish the above-stated purposes and to resolve any differences.  Decisions shall be made from majority vote of all directors.  If any director is absent, the director may authorize the director's designated representative to act in the director's stead.

The appeals board shall upon receipt see to it that the tentative compensation plan is published and that copies, together with the view of the conference of directors, are available to interested parties.</P>

Decisions on changes to the compensation plan shall be made on the basis of majority vote, shall be in writing and accompanied by separate findings, and shall be binding on all jurisdictions.  Each jurisdiction shall be entitled to one vote.  In the event a commissioner is absent, the alternate of that jurisdiction shall vote in the commissioner's stead.</P>

Following the final adjustments, each director shall submit to the state legislature, through the office of the governor, a report setting forth the compensation plan and the cost thereof for its information and approval.  The approved compensation plan shall be effective as of July 1 of each even-numbered year.  The salary range assignments of classes shall not be appealable until the next biennial review of the compensation plan.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The director shall assign new classes to salary ranges on the basis of the policies and standards referred to hereinabove.  The assignments shall be effective immediately if the availability of funds is certified to by the respective fiscal officers, and shall be in effect until adoption of the next compensation plan; provided that pricing appeals therefor may be held every six months, or at the time of the next biennial review.</P>
