The pay differentials may not exceed twenty-five per cent of the minimum rate of the salary range, and shall terminate six months after the date of approval, unless terminated sooner.  Requests for the renewal of such differentials as originally approved by the commission may be granted by the director for periods no longer than six months at a time.</P>
