<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The minimum standard of living which is compatible with decency and health;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The amount of compensation which is offered by employers competing for labor sought by the government with due consideration being given to compensation offered or paid of a nonmonetary character and with proper concern over apparent economic trends.</P></DIR>
