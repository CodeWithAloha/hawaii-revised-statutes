<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§78-12  Salary withheld for indebtedness to the government.</B>  (a)  In case any officer, agent, employee or other person in the service of the State, any county, or any independent board or commission, is indebted to the State, any county, or to any independent board or commission, and the indebtedness has been determined by a hearing pursuant to chapter 91, upon demand of the officer charged with the duty of collecting the indebtedness, the comptroller or other officer charged with the duty of paying the indebted officer, agent, employee, or other person, after notice to the indebted person, shall withhold one-quarter of the salary, wages, or compensation due the indebted person and pay the same, from time to time as the same shall become due, to the officer charged with the duty of collecting the indebtedness, until the full amount of the indebtedness, together with penalties and interest thereon, is paid.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If the indebtedness has arisen or been incurred by reason of the indebted officer, agent, employee, or other person having embezzled, stolen, or otherwise unlawfully acquired any moneys or other property of the State, any county, or any independent board or commission, the whole amount of the salary, wages, or compensation, or so much thereof as may be required to pay the indebtedness in full, shall be withheld and paid over to the officer charged with the duty of collecting the indebtedness.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The officer, agent, employee or other person in the service of the State, any county, or any independent board or commission alleged to be indebted to the State, any county, or to any independent board or commission may waive the right to a hearing to determine the indebtedness and instead assign by contract to the officer charged with the duty of collecting debts:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The priority right to payment of the total amount of the alleged indebtedness; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The right of the officer to deduct from each and every periodic payment normally due the assignor an amount equal to the maximum legally permissible amount deductible under garnishment law until the total amount owing is paid in full.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;For purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to waive the hearing if the person fails to request a hearing within fifteen days from the date the person was notified of the indebtedness and the opportunity to request a hearing.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The operation of all garnishment process served upon the comptroller or other paying officer shall be stayed until the indebtedness has been fully paid.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  If the indebtedness has occurred as a result of salary or wage overpayment, the comptroller or other officer shall determine the amount of indebtedness and notify the employee in writing of the indebtedness.  If the employee contests the comptroller or other officer's determination of indebtedness, the employee may request a hearing pursuant to chapter 91, and upon conclusion of the hearing or if the employee waives the hearing, if the indebtedness is equal to or less than $1,000, the comptroller or other officer shall immediately deduct from any subsequent periodic payment normally due the employee any amount up to the total amount of indebtedness.  For indebtedness greater than $1,000, the comptroller or other officer shall deduct:</P><DIR>
