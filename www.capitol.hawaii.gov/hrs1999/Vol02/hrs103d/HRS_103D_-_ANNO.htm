<P>  The Code did not apply to board of trustees of deferred compensation plan's current administrator and investment-product-provider contracts because they were entered into before the Code's July&nbsp;1, 1994 effective date.  The Code would apply to contracts entered into after that date if "public funds" are used to fund them.  Att. Gen. Op. 94-4.</P>
