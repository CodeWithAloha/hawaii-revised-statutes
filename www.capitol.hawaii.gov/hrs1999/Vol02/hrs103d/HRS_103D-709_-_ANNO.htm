<P>  Where nothing in procurement code or this section gave hearings officer authority to remand award of contract to agency for reevaluation of proposals, remand was in excess of statutory authority.  85 H. 431, 946 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Where, if after award of contract, chief procurement officer finds no violation of law, but after de novo review pursuant to this section, hearings officer finds otherwise, §103D-705 requires hearings officer to determine whether to ratify or terminate contract as provided in §103D-707(1)(A) and (B).  85 H. 431, 946 P.2d 1.</P>
