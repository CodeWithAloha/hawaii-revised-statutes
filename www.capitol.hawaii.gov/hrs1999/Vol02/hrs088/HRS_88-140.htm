In the event the service member fails to reenter the service of the State or any county within the ninety-day period, and shall not have resigned from the system and waived the service member's right to reemployment, the service member's status thereafter shall be the same as that of a regular member who terminated the regular member's employment as such an employee and such termination shall be deemed to have occurred on the ninetieth day after the termination of the service member's service in the armed forces.</P>
