<P>  Board was empowered to make declaratory judgment regarding validity of collective bargaining agreement.  60 H. 436, 591 P.2d 113.</P>
<P>  Section does not bar arbitration of grievances over tenure and promotion.  66 H. 207, 659 P.2d 717.</P>
<P>  Does not limit board's power to order union to implement staffing of essential positions.  66 H. 461, 667 P.2d 783.</P>
<P>  Policy statement was not bargainable to the extent that it constituted compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act.

<P>  County did not violate collective bargaining statutes by refusing to bargain over effects of privatization where because privatization effort was contrary to law, it was outside scope of negotiable topics.  85 H. 61, 937 P.2d 397.</P>
