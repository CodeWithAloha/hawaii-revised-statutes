<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§89-6  Appropriate bargaining units.</B>  (a)  All employees throughout the State within any of the following categories shall constitute an appropriate bargaining unit:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Nonsupervisory employees in blue-collar positions;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Supervisory employees in blue-collar positions;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Nonsupervisory employees in white-collar positions;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Supervisory employees in white-collar positions;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Teachers and other personnel of the department of education under the same salary schedule, including part-time employees working less than twenty hours a week who are equal to one-half of a full-time equivalent;</P>

<P>    (10)&#9;Institutional, health, and correctional workers;</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>    (13)&#9;Professional and scientific employees, other than registered professional nurses.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;Because of the nature of work involved and the essentiality of certain occupations that require specialized training, units (9) through (13) are designated as optional appropriate bargaining units.  Employees in any of these optional units may vote either for separate units or for inclusion in their respective units (1) through (4).  If a majority of the employees in any optional unit desire to constitute a separate appropriate bargaining unit, supervisory employees may be included in the unit by mutual agreement among supervisory and nonsupervisory employees within the unit; if supervisory employees are excluded, the appropriate bargaining unit for these supervisory employees shall be (2) or (4), as the case may be.</P>
<P>&#9;The compensation plans for blue-collar positions pursuant to section 77-5 and for white-collar positions pursuant to section 77-13, the salary schedules for teachers pursuant to section 302A-624 and for educational officers pursuant to section 302A-625, and the appointment and classification of faculty pursuant to sections 304-11 and 304-13, existing on July 1, 1970, shall be the bases for differentiating blue-collar from white-collar employees, professional from institutional, health and correctional workers, supervisory from nonsupervisory employees, teachers from educational officers, and faculty from nonfaculty.  In differentiating supervisory from nonsupervisory employees, class titles alone shall not be the basis for determination, but, in addition, the nature of the work, including whether or not a major portion of the working time of a supervisory employee is spent as part of a crew or team with nonsupervisory employees, shall also be considered.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  For the purpose of negotiations, the public employer of an appropriate bargaining unit shall mean the governor or the governor's designated representatives of not less than three together with not more than two members of the board of education in the case of units (5) and (6), the governor or the governor's designated representatives of not less than three together with not more than two members of the board of regents of the University of Hawaii in the case of units (7) and (8), and the governor or the governor's designated representatives together with the mayors of all the counties or their designated representatives in the case of the remaining units.  The designated employer representatives for units (5), (6), (7), and (8) shall each have one vote and in the case of the remaining units, the governor shall be entitled to four votes and the mayor of each county shall each have one vote, which may be assigned to their designated representatives.  Any decision to be reached by the applicable employer group shall be on the basis of simple majority.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No elected or appointed official, member of any board or commission, representative of a public employer, including the administrative officer, director, or chief of a state or county department or agency, or any major division thereof, as well as any first deputy, first assistant, legal counsel, and other top-level managerial and administrative personnel, secretary to top-level managerial and administrative personnel, individual concerned with confidential matters affecting employee-employer relations, part-time employee working less than twenty hours per week except part-time employees included in unit (5), temporary employee of three months' duration or less, employee of the executive office of the governor, household employee at Washington Place, employee of the executive office of the mayor, staff of the legislative branch of the State, employee of the executive office of the lieutenant governor, inmate, kokua, patient, ward or student of a state institution, student help, any commissioned and enlisted personnel of the Hawaii national guard, or staff of the legislative branches of the city and county of Honolulu and counties of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai, except employees of the clerks' offices of said city and county and counties, shall be included in any appropriate bargaining unit or entitled to coverage under this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Where any controversy arises under this section, the board shall, pursuant to chapter 91, make an investigation and, after a hearing upon due notice, make a final determination on the applicability of this section to specific positions and employees.
