</B>
<P>  The supreme court in Konno v. County of Hawaii rejected the county's §76-77(10) argument not because §46-85 made no reference to civil service laws but because the court was not convinced that §46-85's authorization to contract applied to both garbage-to-energy plants and landfills.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</P>

</B>
<P>  Landfill worker positions were within civil service where position not specifically exempted by another statute as provided by §76-77(10) and this section mentions nothing about civil service nor does it include a specific exemption.  85 H. 61, 937 P.2d 397.</P>
