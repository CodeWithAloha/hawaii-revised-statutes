<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§47-6  Method of authorization.</B>  All bonds of a county issued pursuant to this chapter must be authorized by the governing body of the county issuing same, and shall be authorized by an ordinance or resolution of the governing body, which ordinance or resolution may relate to more than one public improvement or purpose or combination thereof.  It shall be a sufficient recital of purpose of issuance if the ordinance or resolution recites that the proceeds of the bonds authorized therein which are issued for public improvements are to be used to pay all or part of the cost of appropriations for public improvements made in a capital budget ordinance or resolution identified in the bond authorizing ordinance or resolution, or are to be used to establish, maintain, or replenish the special assessment revolving fund of the county, and neither the individual appropriations nor public improvements to which the proceeds are to be applied need be specified in the bond authorizing ordinance or resolution.  The governing body of the county may authorize bonds to pay all or part of the cost of appropriations for public improvements made in a capital budget ordinance in such capital budget ordinance and, in that event, the capital budget ordinance shall constitute the authorizing ordinance under this chapter.
