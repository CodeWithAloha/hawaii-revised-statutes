A decision to appeal to the office of information practices for review of the agency denial shall not prejudice the individual's right to appeal to the circuit court after a decision is made by the office of information practices.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If the decision is to disclose, the office of information practices shall notify the individual and the agency, and the agency shall make the record available.  If the denial of access is upheld, in whole or in part, the office of information practices shall, in writing, notify the individual of the decision, the reasons for the decision, and the right to bring a judicial action under section 92F-27.
