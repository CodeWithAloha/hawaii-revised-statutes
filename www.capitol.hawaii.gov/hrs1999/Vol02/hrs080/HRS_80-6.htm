<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§80-6  Stand-by time pay.</B>  Whenever any government employee is required to report to work and reports to work, but is unable to work because of inclement weather, breakdown of machinery, or other conditions beyond the employee's control, the employee shall be paid a minimum of two hours' pay for that day.</P>
<P>&#9;Any employee of the State or any county, or independent board or commission thereof, who is on stand-by duty after the employee's normal hours of work, or on weekends or holidays, for each day on which the employee renders the service, shall be paid, in addition to the employee's basic compensation, an amount equal to twenty-five per cent of the employee's daily rate of compensation.  An employee shall be deemed to be on stand-by duty when the employee is assigned by the head of the department or other superior to remain at home or at any other designated place for a specified period for the purpose of responding to calls for immediate service.  The fact that an employee may be called to duty in cases of emergency shall not, unless the employee is on stand-by duty, entitle the employee to the additional twenty-five per cent compensation; but, if called to duty, the employee shall be entitled to overtime compensation.
