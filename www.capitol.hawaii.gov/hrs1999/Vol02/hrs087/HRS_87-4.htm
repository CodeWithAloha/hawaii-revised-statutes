If both husband and wife are employee-beneficiaries, the total contribution by the State or the appropriate county shall not exceed the monthly contribution of a family plan for both of them.  If, however, the State or any of the several counties establish cafeteria plans in accordance with section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and part II of chapter 78, the monthly contribution to the fund for those employee-beneficiaries who participate in a cafeteria plan shall be made through the cafeteria plan.  In this event, the payments made by the State or the counties shall include the State's and the counties' respective contributions to the fund and the employee-beneficiary's share of the cost of the health benefits plan selected and authorized by the employee-beneficiary through the cafeteria plan.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The State through the department of budget and finance and the several counties through their respective departments of finance shall pay to the fund a monthly contribution equal to the amount established under chapter 89C or specified in the applicable public sector collective bargaining agreement, whichever is appropriate, for each child who has not attained the age of nineteen of all employee-beneficiaries who are enrolled for dental benefits.  The contributions shall be used towards the payment of costs of dental benefits of a health benefits plan.  Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, no part of the fund shall be used to finance the contributions except a rate credit or reimbursement or earnings or interest therefrom received by the fund or general revenues appropriated for that purpose.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The State through the department of budget and finance and the several counties through their respective departments of finance shall pay to the fund a monthly contribution equal to the amount established under chapter 89C or specified in the applicable public sector collective bargaining agreement, whichever is applicable, for each of their respective employees, to be used towards the payment of group life insurance benefits for each employee.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The several counties through their respective departments of finance shall annually reimburse the State no later than December 30 of each fiscal year for their respective pro rata share of the cost of administering the fund for the fiscal year for the benefit of their employee-beneficiaries and dependent-beneficiaries.  Each county's pro rata share shall be determined by allocating the amount appropriated for administering the fund for the fiscal year, after excluding therefrom state and county contributions for health and group life insurance benefits, in the same proportion as the aggregate annual amount of state and county contributions for such benefits as of October&nbsp;31 of the preceding fiscal year.  The amount of any excess or deficiency required to administer the fund shall be subtracted from or added to, as the case may be, the amount due from each county for the succeeding fiscal year.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The State through the department of budget and finance and the several counties through their respective departments of finance shall advance the amount of their respective employee-beneficiaries contributions to the fund on or before the first day of each month.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Contributions made by the State or the several counties shall not be considered as wages or salary of an employee-beneficiary, and no employee-beneficiary shall have any vested right in or be entitled to receive any part of any contribution made to the fund.
