<P>  Additional requirements for publication of notice of public hearings, see §92-41.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Attorney General Opinions</P>
</B>
<P>  The "General Requirements and Covenants" of public works contracts are rules as defined by section 91-1 and any amendments require notice and a public hearing.  Att. Gen. Op. 66-10.</P>
<P>  Section is limited to rules having the force and effect of law; AG Opinion 66-10 superseded.  Att. Gen. Op. 72-5.</P>
<P>  State agency required by subsection (a)(1) to publish notice of hearing must in addition comply with publication requirements of section 92-41.  Att. Gen. Op. 73-12.</P>
<P>  Board cannot adopt "policy" which would have the effect of amending a rule, without following HAPA requirements.  Att. Gen. Op. 81-11.</P>
<P>  Notices are not required to be in the legal section of a newspaper.  Att. Gen. Op. 89-4.</P>
<P>  Substantial changes in proposed rules made after public hearing require additional hearing where material is included on subject not covered in original notice or change was not advocated or discussed at original hearing.  Att. Gen. Op. 91-05.</P>
<P>  For the repeal of rules, this section and §92-41 did not require individual notice to all property owners potentially affected by the change in the rules but only notice by publication, and a mailing to those persons who requested advance notice of department's rulemaking proceedings.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-4.</P>

</B>
<P>  Where defendant did not give notice and hold public hearing pursuant to subsection (a) before issuing approval of use of wood preservative, defendant's approval, together with defendant's conditions of approval, would appear to be rulemaking.  939 F. Supp. 746.</P>
<P>  Department provided adequate notice under this chapter of its intent to hold public hearings on proposed amendments to its administrative rules; nothing in chapter or case law requires that notice of public hearings on proposed amendments be published only after the effective date of the statute authorizing such amendments.  88 H. 307, 966 P.2d 619.</P>
<P>  Where city appraiser’s unwritten methodology for determining imparted value fell within definition of a rule for purposes of §91-1(4), city needed to follow rulemaking procedures set forth in this section prior to applying imparted value deductions toward golf course assessments.  89 H. 381, 974 P.2d 21.</P>
<P>  Changes may be made in a rule between the original proposed and presented at a public hearing and as finally adopted.  Substantial change in a rule after a public hearing may require another public hearing.  50 H. 156, 434 P.2d 516.</P>
<P>  Notice should fairly apprise interested parties of what is being proposed so they can formulate and present rational responses to the proposal.  64 H. 389, 642 P.2d 530.</P>
<P>  "Substance" of proposed rules defined.  64 H. 389, 642 P.2d 530.</P>
<P>  Rule enabling insurance commissioner to prescribe endorsements did not give carte blanche authority to sidestep the independent requirements of chapter 91.  67 H. 148, 682 P.2d 73.</P>
<P>  Adoption by reference of future amendments unlawful.  67 H. 451, 691 P.2d 365.</P>
<P>  No waiver of notice and hearing requirements allowed where agency had discretion to interpret federal provisions as to required rules.  68 H. 80, 705 P.2d 17.</P>
<P>  Inadequate notice, discussed.  70 H. 135, 764 P.2d 1233.</P>
<P>  Notice of public hearing met all requirements of this section; no merit to points on appeal that court erroneously dismissed claims that proposed hearing room was too small and that separate hearings should be held on neighbor islands.  10 H. App. 210, 863 P.2d 344.</P>
