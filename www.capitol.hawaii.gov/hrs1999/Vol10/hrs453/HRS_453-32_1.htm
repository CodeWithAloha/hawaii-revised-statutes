Applicants for reregistration shall pay a renewal fee and provide evidence of compliance with the continuing education requirements set forth in the board's rules.  Failure to reregister, including noncompliance with the continuing education requirements, shall constitute a forfeiture of the certificate which may only be restored upon written application for reregistration and payment to the board of a restoration fee.  A certificate that has been forfeited for one renewal term shall be automatically terminated and cannot be restored, and a new application for certification shall be required.
