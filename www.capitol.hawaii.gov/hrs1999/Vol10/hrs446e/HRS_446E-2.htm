If the unaccredited institution includes in its catalogs, promotional materials, or contracts for instruction any other information relating in any manner to accreditation, or to accreditation by an agency not nationally recognized by the United States Secretary of Education, the disclosure required by this subsection shall be repeated on every page on which the information appears.

<P>&#9;Note:  In the United States, many licensing authorities require accredited degrees as the basis for eligibility for licensing.  In some cases, accredited colleges may not accept for transfer courses and degrees completed at unaccredited colleges, and some employers may require an accredited degree as a basis for eligibility for employment.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  Every unaccredited institution subject to this chapter shall keep true and accurate records of student enrollment, courses, fees, and matriculation rates.  These records shall be retained for five years.  Upon demand, these records, and any other information requested or subpoenaed by the director, shall be made available to the director.
