<P>&#9;Nothing herein contained shall permit or authorize any licensee to perform, or attempt to perform, advertise, or hold out to the public or to any person that the licensee is authorized, qualified, or licensed to perform, pest control work in any branch, or by any method, for which the licensee is not licensed.</P>
<P>&#9;Subcontracting of work, as permitted herein, shall not relieve the prime contractor or the subcontractor from responsibility for, or from disciplinary action because of, any act or omission on the contractor's or subcontractor's part, which would otherwise be a ground for disciplinary action. [L 1975, c 91, §1; gen ch 1985]</P>
