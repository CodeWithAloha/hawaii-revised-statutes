The board may provide separate fees for licensure by endorsement and for limited and temporary licenses.  Every person holding a license under this chapter shall reregister with the board no later than January&nbsp;31 of each even-numbered year, and for registration shall pay a renewal fee.  At the time of reregistration, the licensee shall provide written proof of a minimum of forty hours of postgraduate work or continuing education of podiatric medicine taken during the previous biennium.  Failure to reregister and present this proof shall constitute a forfeiture of the license, which may be restored only upon written application therefor and payment to the board of a restoration fee.  A license that has been forfeited for one renewal term shall be automatically terminated and cannot be restored, and a new application for licensure shall be required.
