<P>&#9;In addition, a licensed dental hygienist may administer intra-oral infiltration local anesthesia and intra-oral block anesthesia under the direct supervision of a dentist after being certified by the board, and for those categories of intra-oral infiltration local anesthesia and intra-oral block anesthesia for which the licensed dental hygienist has been certified through a course of study meeting the requirements of this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The licensed dental hygienist may operate in the office of any licensed dentist, or legally incorporated eleemosynary dental dispensary or infirmary, private school, or welfare center, or in any building owned or occupied by the State or any county, but only under the aforesaid employment and under the direct or general supervision of a licensed dentist; provided that in the private practice of dentistry, the hygienist shall be under the direct supervision of a licensed dentist.
