Any person may prefer charges in writing with the executive secretary of the board against any person holding a license.</P>
<P>&#9;In every case where it is proposed to impose any penalty under this section, the board shall give the licensee concerned notice and hearing in conformity with chapter 91.  The notice shall be given in writing by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested at least fifteen days before the hearing.</P>
<P>&#9;In all proceedings before it, the board and each member thereof shall have the same powers respecting administering oaths, compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence, and examining witnesses, as are possessed by circuit courts.  In case of disobedience by any person of any order of the board or of any member thereof, or of any subpoena issued by it or by a member, or the refusal of any witness to testify to any matter regarding which the person may be questioned lawfully, any circuit judge, on application by the board or a member thereof, shall compel obedience as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued by a circuit court, or a refusal to testify therein.</P>
<P>&#9;Any licensee who violates this chapter or the rules adopted pursuant thereto may also be fined not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 per violation.  Each day of violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense.
