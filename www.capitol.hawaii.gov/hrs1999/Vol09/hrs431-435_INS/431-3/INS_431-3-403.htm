<P>(B)&#9;If a life or health insurer, the insurer has total adjusted capital which is greater than or equal to its company action level risk-based capital but less than the product of its authorized control level risk-based capital and 2.5, and has a negative trend;</P></DIR>

<P>(2)&#9;The notification by the commissioner to the insurer of an adjusted risk-based capital report that indicates the occurrence of the event in paragraph (1), if the insurer does not challenge the adjusted risk-based capital report under section 431:3-407; or</P>

</DIR>

<P>(d)  Within sixty days after the submission by an insurer of a risk-based capital plan to the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the insurer whether the risk-based capital plan shall be implemented or is, in the judgment of the commissioner, unsatisfactory.  If the commissioner determines the risk-based capital plan is unsatisfactory, the notification to the insurer shall set forth the reasons for the determination, and may set forth proposed revisions which will render the risk-based capital plan satisfactory, in the judgment of the commissioner.  Upon notification from the commissioner, the insurer shall prepare a revised risk-based capital plan, which may incorporate by reference any revisions proposed by the commissioner, and shall submit the revised risk-based capital plan to the commissioner:</P><DIR>

<P>(2)&#9;If the insurer challenges the notification from the commissioner under section 431:3-407, within forty-five days after a notification to the insurer that the commissioner has, after a hearing, rejected the insurer's challenge.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(1)&#9;That state has a risk-based capital provision substantially similar to section 431:3-408(a); and</P>
<P>(2)&#9;The insurance commissioner of that state has notified the insurer of its request for the filing in writing, in which case the insurer shall file a copy of the risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan in that state no later than the later of:</P><DIR>

<P>(A)&#9;Fifteen days after the receipt of notice to file a copy of its risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan with that state; or</P>
<P>(B)&#9;The date on which the risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan is filed under subsections (c) and (d). [L 1994, c 190, pt of §1; am L 1995, c 61, §2 as superseded by c 232, §4; am L 1997, c 75, §5; am L 1999, c 128, §2]</P>
