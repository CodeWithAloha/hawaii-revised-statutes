<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§431:10B-109  Premiums and refunds.</B>  (a)  Any insurer may revise its schedules of premium rates from time to time, and shall file the revised schedules for approval with the commissioner.  No insurer shall issue any credit life insurance policy or credit disability insurance policy for which the premium rate exceeds that determined by the schedules of the insurer as then on file with and approved by the commissioner.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Each individual policy, group certificate, or notice of proposed insurance shall provide that in the event of termination of the insurance prior to the scheduled maturity date of the indebtedness, any refund of an amount paid by the debtor for the insurance shall be paid or credited promptly to the person entitled thereto; provided that the commissioner, by rules and regulations, shall prescribe a minimum refund and no refund which would be less than the minimum need be made.  The formula to be used in computing the refund shall be filed with and approved by the commissioner.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If a creditor requires a debtor to make any payment for credit life insurance or credit disability insurance and an individual policy or group certificate of insurance is not issued, the creditor shall immediately give written notice to the debtor and shall promptly make an appropriate credit to the next payment due on the account.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The amount charged to a debtor for any credit life or credit disability insurance shall not exceed the premium charged by the insurer, as computed at the time the charge to the debtor is determined.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to authorize any payments for insurance now prohibited under any statute, or rule thereunder, governing credit transactions. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</P>
