This option shall be available to the insured if requested within five months after termination and shall allow for the collection of past due premium, where appropriate.  The standard of proof of cognitive impairment or loss of functional capacity shall not be more stringent than the benefit eligibility criteria on cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity contained in the policy and certificate.
