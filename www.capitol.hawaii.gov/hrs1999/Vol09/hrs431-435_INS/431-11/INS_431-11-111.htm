<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§431:11-111  Sanctions.  </B>(a)  Any insurer failing, without just cause, to file any registration statement as required in this article shall be required, after notice and hearing, to pay a penalty of $100 for each day's delay, to be recovered by the commissioner and the penalty so recovered shall be paid into the insurance regulation fund of this State.  The maximum penalty under this subsection is $5,000.  The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the insurer demonstrates to the commissioner that the imposition of the penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Every director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates, participates in, or assents to, or who knowingly shall permit any of the officers or agents of the insurer to engage in any transactions or make investments which have not been properly reported or submitted pursuant to sections 431:11-105(a), 431:11-106(a)(2), or 431:11-106(b) or who violates this article, shall pay, in their individual capacity, a civil forfeiture of not more than $5,000 per violation, after notice and hearing before the commissioner.  In determining the amount of the civil forfeiture, the commissioner shall take into account the appropriateness of the forfeiture with respect to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any insurer subject to this article or any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof has engaged in any transaction or entered into a contract which is subject to section 431:11-106 and which would not have been approved had the approval been requested, the commissioner may order the insurer to cease and desist immediately any further activity under that transaction or contract.  After notice and hearing, the commissioner may also order the insurer to void any of the contracts and restore the status quo if that action is in the best interest of the policyholders, creditors, or the public.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any insurer or any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof has committed a wilful violation of this article, the commissioner may cause criminal proceedings to be instituted against the insurer or the responsible director, officer, employee, or agent thereof.  Any insurer who wilfully violates this article may be fined not more than $5,000.  Any individual who wilfully violates this article may be fined in the individual's capacity not more than $5,000, or be imprisoned for not more than one year.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Any officer, director, or employee of an insurance holding company system who wilfully and knowingly subscribes to or makes, or causes to be made, any false statements or false reports or false filings with the intent to deceive the commissioner in the performance of the commissioner's duties under this article, upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for not more than one year, or fined $5,000, or both.  Any fines imposed shall be paid by the officer, director, or employee in their individual capacity. [L 1987, c 349, pt of §8; am L 1999, c 163, §15(1)]</P>
