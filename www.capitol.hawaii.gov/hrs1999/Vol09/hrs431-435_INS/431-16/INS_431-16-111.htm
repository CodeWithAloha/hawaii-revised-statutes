<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§431:16-111  Effect of paid claims.</B>  (a)  Any person recovering under this code shall be deemed to have assigned the person's rights under the policy to the association to the extent of the person's recovery from the association.  Every insured or claimant seeking the protection of this part shall cooperate with the association to the same extent as such person would have been required to cooperate with the insolvent insurer.  The association shall have no cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out except such causes of action as the insolvent insurer would have had if such sums had been paid by the insolvent insurer and except as provided in subsection (b).  In the case of an insolvent insurer operating as an assessable mutual company on a plan with assessment liability, payments of claims of the association shall not operate to reduce the liability of the insureds to the receiver, liquidator or statutory successor for unpaid assessment.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The association shall have the right to recover from the following persons the amount of any covered claim paid on behalf of such person pursuant to this part:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Any insured whose net worth on December&nbsp;31 of the year immediately preceding the date the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer exceeds fifty million dollars and whose liability obligations to other persons are satisfied in whole or in part by payments made under this part; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Any person who is an affiliate of the insolvent insurer and whose liability obligations to other persons are satisfied in whole or in part by payments made under this part.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  The receiver, liquidator or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer shall be bound by settlements of covered claims by the association or a similar organization in another state.  The court having jurisdiction shall grant such claims priority equal to that which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of this part against the assets of the insolvent insurer.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The association shall periodically file with the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer statements of the covered claims paid by the association and estimates of anticipated claims on the association, which shall preserve the rights of the association against the assets of the insolvent insurer.
