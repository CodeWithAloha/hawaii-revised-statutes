<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§431:16-108  Powers and duties of the association.</B>  (a)  The association shall:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Be obligated to the extent of the covered claims existing prior to the determination of insolvency, which the insolvent insurer would have been legally obligated to pay but for its insolvency, and arising within thirty days after the determination of insolvency, or before the policy expiration date if less than thirty days after the determination, or before the insured replaces the policy or causes its cancellation, if the insurer does so within thirty days of the determination, but the obligation shall include only that amount of each covered claim which is less than $300,000, except that the association shall pay the full amount of any covered claim arising out of a workers' compensation policy.  In no event shall the association be obligated to a policyholder or claimant in an amount in excess of the stated policy limit of the insolvent insurer under the policy from which the claim arises;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Be deemed the insurer, but only to the extent of its obligation on covered claims and to that extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Assess insurers amounts necessary to pay the obligations of the association under subsection (a)(1) subsequent to an insolvency, the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, and the cost of examinations under section 431:16-113, and other expenses authorized by this part.  The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year.  Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than thirty days before it is due.  No member insurer may be assessed in any year an amount greater than two per cent of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year.  If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association, does not provide in any one year an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments, the funds available shall be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available.  The association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance.  Each member insurer may set off against any assessment payments authorized by the administrator of the association to be made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of the claims by the member insurer;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Investigate claims brought against the association and adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the association's obligation and deny all other claims and may review settlements, releases, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which such settlements, releases, and judgments may be properly contested;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Notify the persons as the commissioner directs under section 431:16-110(b)(1);</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities.  Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of the commissioner, but the designation may be declined by a member insurer;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;Reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and shall pay the other expenses of the association authorized by this code; and</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Have the authority, notwithstanding sections 431:10C-110 and 431:10C-111, to cancel all policies issued by an insolvent insurer.  All claims under these policies shall be covered by the association in an amount not to exceed the state policy limit of the insolvent insurer under the policy from which the claim arises.</P></DIR>
