<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Make recommendations to the commissioner for the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Respond to requests by the commissioner to discuss and make recommendations regarding the status of any member insurer whose financial condition may be determined by the commissioner to be hazardous to policyholders or the public.  Such recommendations shall not be considered public documents.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The board of directors may, upon majority vote, request that the commissioner order an examination of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public.  Within thirty days of the receipt of such request, the commissioner shall begin the examination.  The examination may be conducted as a National Association of Insurance Commissioners examination or may be conducted by such persons as the commissioner designates.  The cost of such examination shall be paid by the association and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports.  In no event shall such examination report be released to the board of directors prior to its release to the public, but this shall not preclude the commissioner from reporting to the board of directors when the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that any member insurer examined or being examined at the request of the board of directors may be insolvent or in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public.  The commissioner shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed.  The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the commissioner but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  The board of directors may, at the conclusion of any domestic insurer insolvency in which the association was obligated to pay covered claims, prepare a report on the history and causes of such insolvency, based on the information available to the association and submit such report to the commissioner.
