<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§431:10C-308.5</B>  <B>Limitation on charges.</B>  (a)  As used in this article, the term "workers' compensation schedules" means the schedules adopted and as may be amended by the director of labor and industrial relations for workers' compensation cases under chapter 386, establishing fees and frequency of treatment guidelines, and contained in sections 12-13-30, 12-13-35, 12-13-38, 12-13-39, 12-13-45, 12-13-85 through 92, and 12-13-94, Hawaii administrative rules.  References in the workers' compensation schedules to "the employer", "the director", and "the industrial injury", shall be respectively construed as references to "the insurer", "the commissioner", and "the injury covered by personal injury protection benefits" for purposes of this article.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The charges and frequency of treatment for services specified in section 431:10C-103.5(a), except for emergency services provided within seventy-two hours following a motor vehicle accident resulting in injury, shall not exceed the charges and frequency of treatment permissible under the workers' compensation schedules.  Charges for independent medical examinations, including record reviews, physical examinations, history taking, and reports, to be conducted by a licensed Hawaii provider unless the insured consents to an out-of-state provider, shall not exceed the charges permissible under the workers' compensation schedules for consultation for a complex medical problem.  The workers' compensation schedules shall not apply to independent medical examinations conducted by out-of-state providers; provided that the charges for the examination are reasonable.  All records relating to an independent medical examination shall be made available to the claimant upon request.  The commissioner may adopt administrative rules relating to fees or frequency of treatment for injuries covered by personal injury protection benefits.  If adopted, these administrative rules shall prevail to the extent that they are inconsistent with the workers' compensation schedules.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Charges for services for which no fee is set by the workers' compensation schedules or other administrative rules adopted by the commissioner shall be limited to eighty per cent of the provider's usual and customary charges for these services.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Services for which no frequency of treatment guidelines are set forth in the workers' compensation schedules or other administrative rules adopted by the commissioner shall be deemed appropriate and reasonable expenses necessarily incurred if so determined by a provider.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The provider of services described in section 431:10C-103.5(a) shall not bill the insured directly for those services but shall bill the insurer for a determination of the amount payable.  The provider shall not bill or otherwise attempt to collect from the insured the difference between the provider's full charge and the amount paid by the insurer.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)<B>  </B>A<B> </B>health<B> </B>care provider shall be compensated by the insurer for preparing reports documenting the need for treatments which exceed the schedules in accordance with the fee schedule for special reports.  The health care provider may assess the cost of preparing a report to the insurer at no more than $20 per page up to a maximum of $75 for each report.
