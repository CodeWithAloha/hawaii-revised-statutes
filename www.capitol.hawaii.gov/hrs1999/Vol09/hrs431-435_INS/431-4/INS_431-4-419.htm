<P>&#9;(b)  Each subscriber's share of a deficiency for which an assessment is made, not exceeding in any event the subscriber's aggregate contingent liability as computed in accordance with section 431:4-418, shall be computed by applying to the premium earned on the subscriber's policy or policies during the period to be covered by the assessment, the ratio of the total deficiency to the total premiums earned during the period upon all policies subject to assessment.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In computing the earned premiums for the purposes of this section, the gross premium received by the insurer for the policy shall be used as a base, deducting therefrom solely charges not recurring upon the renewal or extension of the policy.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  No subscriber shall have an offset against any assessment for which the subscriber is liable on account of any claim for unearned premium or losses payable. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</P>
