<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§431:4-326  Members' share of assets.</B>  (a)  Upon the liquidation of a domestic mutual insurer, its assets remaining after discharge of its indebtedness and policy obligations shall be distributed to its members who were members within the thirty-six months prior to the last termination of its certificate of authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The distributive share of each member shall be in the proportion that the aggregate premiums earned by the insurer on the policies of the member during the combined periods of the member's membership, bear to the aggregate of all premiums so earned on the policies of all members.  If a life insurer, the insurer shall make a reasonable classification of its life insurance policies so held by the members and a formula, based upon such classification, for determining the equitable distributive share of each such member.  The classification and formula shall be subject to the commissioner's approval. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</P>
