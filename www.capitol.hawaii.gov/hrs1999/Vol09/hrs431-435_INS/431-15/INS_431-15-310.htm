<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Hold hearings, subpoena witnesses to compel their attendance, administer oaths, examine any person under oath, and compel any party to subscribe to their testimony after it has been correctly reduced to writing, and in connection therewith require the production of any books, papers, records or other documents which the liquidator deems relevant to the inquiry;</P>

<P>&#9;(9)&#9;Acquire, hypothecate, encumber, lease, improve, sell, transfer, abandon, or otherwise dispose of or deal with, any property of the insurer at its market value or upon such terms and conditions as are fair and reasonable.  The liquidator shall also have power to execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all deeds, assignments, releases and other instruments necessary or proper to effectuate any sale of property or other transaction in connection with the liquidation;</P>
<P>    (10)&#9;Borrow money on the security of the insurer's assets, or without security, and to execute and deliver all documents necessary to that transaction for the purpose of facilitating the liquidation;</P>

<P>    (12)&#9;Continue to prosecute and institute in the name of the insurer or in the liquidator's own name any and all suits and other legal proceedings in this State or elsewhere, and abandon the prosecution of claims the liquidator deems unprofitable to pursue further.

<P>    (14)&#9;Remove any or all records and property of the insurer to the offices of the commissioner or to such other place as may be convenient for the purposes of efficient and orderly execution of the liquidation.

<P>    (15)&#9;Deposit in one or more banks in this State such sums as are required for meeting current administration expenses and dividend distributions;</P>
<P>    (16)&#9;Invest all sums not currently needed, unless the court orders otherwise;</P>
<P>    (17)&#9;File any necessary documents for recordation in the bureau of conveyances or other appropriate office or elsewhere where property of the insurer is located;</P>
<P>    (18)&#9;Assert all defenses available to the insurer as against third persons, including statutes of limitations, statutes of frauds, and the defense of usury.  A waiver of any defense by the insurer after a petition in liquidation has been filed shall not bind the liquidator.

<P>    (19)&#9;Exercise and enforce all the rights, remedies, and powers of any creditor, shareholder, policyholder, or member, including any power to avoid any transfer or lien that may be given by the general law and that is not included with section 431:15-315 through section 431:15-317;</P>
<P>    (20)&#9;Intervene in any proceeding wherever instituted that might lead to the appointment of a receiver or trustee, and act as the receiver or trustee whenever the appointment is offered;</P>
