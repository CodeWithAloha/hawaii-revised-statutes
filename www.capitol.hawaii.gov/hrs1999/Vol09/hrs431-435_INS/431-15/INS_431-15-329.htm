<P>&#9;(b)  Whenever objections are filed with the liquidator and the liquidator does not alter the denial of the claim as a result of the objections, the liquidator shall ask the court for a hearing as soon as practicable and give notice of the hearing by first class mail to the claimant or the claimant's attorney and to any other persons directly affected, not less than ten nor more than thirty days before the date of the hearing.  The matter may be heard by the court or by a court appointed referee who shall submit findings of fact along with such referee's recommendations. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</P>
