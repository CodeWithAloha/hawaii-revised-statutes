<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-23  Shares represented by certificates and uncertificated shares.</B>  The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates or shall be uncertificated shares. Certificates shall be signed by the chairperson or vice chairperson of the board of directors or the president or a vice president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, and may be sealed with the seal of the corporation or a facsimile thereof.  Any or all of the signatures upon a certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon the certificate has ceased to be an officer, transfer agent or registrar before the certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if the officer, transfer agent or registrar were an officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of its issue.</P>
<P>&#9;Every certificate representing shares issued by a corporation which is authorized to issue shares of more than one class shall set forth upon the face or back of the certificate, or shall state that the corporation will furnish to any shareholder upon request and without charge, a full statement of the designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights of the shares of each class authorized to be issued, and if the corporation is authorized to issue any preferred or special class in series, the variations in the relative rights and preferences between the shares of each such series so far as the same have been fixed and determined and the authority of the board of directors to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of subsequent series.</P>
<P>&#9;Each certificate representing shares shall state upon the face thereof:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;That the corporation is organized under the laws of this State;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The name of the person to whom the certificate is issued;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The number and class of shares, and the designation of the series, if any, which the certificate represents; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The par value of each share represented by the certificate, or a statement that the shares are without par value.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;No certificate shall be issued for any share until the consideration established for its issuance has been paid.</P>
<P>&#9;Unless otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation, the board of directors of a corporation may provide by resolution that some or all of any of all classes and series of its shares shall be uncertificated shares; provided that the resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the corporation.  Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated shares, the corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this section.  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing shares of the same class and series shall be identical.
