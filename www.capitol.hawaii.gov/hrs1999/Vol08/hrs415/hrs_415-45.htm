<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-45  Distributions to shareholders.</B>  Subject to any restrictions in the articles of incorporation, the board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions, except that no distribution may be made if, after giving effect thereto, either:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The corporation would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its business; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities and, unless the articles of incorporation otherwise permit, the maximum amount that then would be payable, in any liquidation, in respect of all outstanding shares having preferential rights in liquidation.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;Determinations under paragraph (2) may be based upon (A) financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances, or (B) a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
<P>&#9;In the case of a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of a corporation's shares, the effect of a distribution shall be measured as of the date money or other property is transferred or debt is incurred by the corporation, or as of the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder of the corporation with respect to the shares, whichever is earlier.  In all other cases, the effect of a distribution shall be measured as of the date of its authorization if payment occurs one hundred twenty days or less following the date of authorization, or as of the date of payment if payment occurs more than one hundred twenty days following the date of authorization.</P>
<P>&#9;Indebtedness of a corporation incurred or issued to a shareholder in a distribution in accordance with this section shall be on a parity with the indebtedness of the corporation to its general unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.
