<P>&#9;Neither the repeals effected by the enactment of this chapter nor the amendment thereof shall impair or take away any existing liability, cause of action, or right against any corporation, its shareholders, directors, or officers incurred prior to the time of the enactment or amendment.</P>
<P>&#9;Nothing in this chapter shall affect the validity of any action taken by any corporation, or shall impair or affect the validity of any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws adopted by any corporation, prior to the effective date of this chapter.</P>
