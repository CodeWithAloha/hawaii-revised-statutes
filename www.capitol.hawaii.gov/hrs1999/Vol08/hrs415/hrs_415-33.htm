If the articles of incorporation provide for more or less than one vote for any share on any matter, every reference in this chapter to a majority or other proportion of shares shall refer to such a majority or other proportion of votes entitled to be cast.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of the other corporation is held by the corporation, shall not be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.</P>

<P>&#9;(e)  If, not less than forty-eight hours prior to the time fixed for any annual or special meeting, any shareholder or shareholders delivers to any officer of the corporation, a request that the election of directors to be elected at the meeting be by cumulative voting, then the directors to be elected at the meeting shall be chosen as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Each shareholder present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall have a number of votes equal to the number of shares of capital stock owned by the shareholder multiplied by the number of directors to be elected at the meeting;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Each shareholder shall be entitled to cumulate the votes of said shareholder and give all thereof to one nominee or to distribute the votes of said shareholder in such manner as the shareholder determines among any or all of the nominees; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The nominees receiving the highest number of votes on the foregoing basis, up to the total number of directors to be elected at the meeting, shall be the successful nominees.  The right to have directors elected by cumulative voting as aforesaid shall exist notwithstanding that provision therefor is not included in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, and this right shall not be restricted or qualified by any provisions of the articles of incorporation or bylaws; provided that this right may be restricted, qualified, or eliminated by a provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of any corporation having a class of equity securities registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are either listed on a national securities exchange or traded over-the-counter on the National Market of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

<P>&#9;(f)  Shares standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent, or proxy as the bylaws of the other corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of any provision, as the board of directors of the other corporation may determine.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  Shares held by a personal representative may be voted by that individual, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of the shares into that individual's name.  Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held without a transfer of the shares into the trustee's name.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by the receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by the receiver without the transfer thereof into the receiver's name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which the receiver was appointed.</P>
<P>&#9;(i)  A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote the shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.</P>
<P>&#9;(j)  On and after the date on which written notice of redemption of redeemable shares has been mailed to the holders thereof and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank or trust company with irrevocable instruction and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders thereof upon surrender of certificates therefor, the shares shall not be entitled to vote on any matter and are not deemed to be outstanding shares.
