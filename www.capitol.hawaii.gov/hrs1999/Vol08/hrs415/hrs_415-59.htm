<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The board of directors shall adopt a resolution setting forth the proposed amendment and, if shares have been issued, directing that it be submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, which may be either the annual or a special meeting.  If no shares have been issued, the amendment shall be adopted by resolution of the board of directors and the provisions for adoption by shareholders shall not apply.  If the corporation has only one class of shares outstanding, an amendment solely to change the number of authorized shares to effectuate a split of, or stock dividend in, the corporation's own shares, or solely to do so and to change the number of authorized shares in proportion thereto, may be adopted by the board of directors, and the provisions for adoption by shareholders shall not apply, unless otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Written notice setting forth the proposed amendment or a summary of the changes to be effected thereby shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote thereon within the time and in the manner provided in this chapter for the giving of notice of meetings of shareholders.  If the meeting is an annual meeting, the proposed amendment or the summary may be included in the notice of the annual meeting.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;With respect to corporations incorporated on or after July&nbsp;1, 1987, at such meeting a vote of the shareholders entitled to vote thereon shall be taken on the proposed amendment.  The proposed amendment shall be adopted upon receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon, unless any class of shares is entitled to vote thereon as a class, in which event the proposed amendment shall be adopted upon receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of each class of shares entitled to vote thereon as a class and of the total shares entitled to vote thereon.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;With respect to corporations incorporated before July&nbsp;1, 1987, at such meeting a vote of the shareholders entitled to vote thereon shall be taken on the proposed amendment.  The proposed amendment shall be adopted upon receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares having voting power.  The articles of incorporation may be amended by the vote set forth in the preceding sentence to provide for a lesser proportion of shares, or of any class or series thereof, than is provided in the preceding sentence, in which case the articles of incorporation shall control, provided that said lesser proportion shall not be less than the proportion set forth in paragraph (3) of this section.  Any number of amendments may be submitted to the shareholders, and voted upon by them, at one meeting.
