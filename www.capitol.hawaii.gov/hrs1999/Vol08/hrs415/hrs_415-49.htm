<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-49  Provisions relating to actions by shareholders.</B>  No action shall be brought in this State by a shareholder in the right of a domestic or foreign corporation unless the plaintiff was a holder of record of shares or of voting trust certificates therefor at the time of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains, or the plaintiff's shares or voting trust certificates thereafter devolved upon the plaintiff by operation of law from a person who was a holder of record at that time.</P>
<P>&#9;In any action hereafter instituted in the right of any domestic or foreign corporation by the holder or holders of record of shares of the corporation or of voting trust certificates therefor, the court having jurisdiction, upon final judgment and a finding that the action was brought without reasonable cause, may require the plaintiff or plaintiffs to pay to the parties named as defendant the reasonable expenses, including fees of attorneys, incurred by them in the defense of the action.</P>
<P>&#9;In any action now pending or hereafter instituted or maintained in the right of any domestic or foreign corporation by the holder or holders of record of less than five per cent of the outstanding shares of any class of the corporation or of voting trust certificates therefor, unless the shares or voting trust certificates so held have a market value in excess of $25,000, the corporation in whose right the action is brought shall be entitled at any time before final judgment to require the plaintiff or plaintiffs to give security for the reasonable expenses, including fees of attorneys, that may be incurred by it in connection with the action or may be incurred by other parties named as defendant for which it may become legally liable.  Market value shall be determined as of the date that the plaintiff institutes the action or, in the case of an intervenor, as of the date that the intervenor becomes a party to the action.  The amount of the security may from time to time be increased or decreased, in the discretion of the court, upon showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or is excessive.  The corporation shall have recourse to the security in such amount as the court having jurisdiction shall determine upon the termination of the action, whether or not the court finds the action was brought without reasonable cause.
