<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-19  Payment for shares.</B>  (a)  The powers granted in this section to the board of directors may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate.  That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefor are fully paid and nonassessable.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  During the first two years after incorporation the corporation shall, and thereafter the corporation may place in escrow, shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares.  The corporation may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the note paid, or the benefits received.  If the services are not performed, the note is not paid, or the benefits are not received, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited may be cancelled in whole or in part.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  If a corporation issues or authorizes issuance of shares for promissory notes or for promises to render services in the future, the corporation shall report in writing to the shareholders the number of shares authorized or issued, and the consideration received by the corporation, with or before the notice of the next shareholders' meeting.
