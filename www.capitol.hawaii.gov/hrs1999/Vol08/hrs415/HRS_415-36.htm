<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§415-36  Number and election of directors.</B>  If the corporation has only one shareholder, the corporation shall have one or more directors.  If the corporation has two shareholders, the corporation shall have two or more directors.  If the corporation has three or more shareholders, the corporation shall have three or more directors.  The number of directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, except as to the number constituting the initial board of directors, which number shall be fixed by the articles of incorporation.  The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment to, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, but no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.  In the absence of a bylaw providing for the number of directors, the number shall be the same as that provided for in the articles of incorporation.  The names and addresses of the members of the first board of directors shall be stated in the articles of incorporation.  Such persons shall hold office until the first annual meeting of shareholders, and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified.  At the first annual meeting of shareholders and at each annual meeting thereafter the shareholders shall elect directors to hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting, except in case of the classification of directors as permitted by this chapter.  Each director shall hold office for the term for which the director is elected and until the director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.
