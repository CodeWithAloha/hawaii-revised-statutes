<P>&#9;(d)  In each case where the director has given a corporation notice of intention to dissolve the corporation on the grounds that its articles of incorporation have been procured through fraud, the corporation shall be entitled to petition for an administrative hearing under chapter 91 and shall give written notice to the director thereof, before the director may declare the corporation dissolved under subsection (a) of this section. </P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The director shall, in each case, deliver a copy of the decree of dissolution to the director of taxation and to the finance officer of each county.</P>
