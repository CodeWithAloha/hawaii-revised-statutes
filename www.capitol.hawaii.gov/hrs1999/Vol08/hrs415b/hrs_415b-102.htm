<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§415B-102]  Filing of claims in liquidation proceedings.</B>  In proceedings to liquidate the assets and affairs of a corporation the court may require all creditors of the corporation to file with the clerk of the court or with the receiver, in any form the court prescribes, proof under oath of their respective claims.  If the court requires the filing of claims it shall fix a date, not less than four months from the date of the order, as the last day for the filing of claims and shall prescribe the notice to be given to creditors and claimants of the date so fixed.  Prior to such date, the court may extend the time for the filing of claims.  Creditors and claimants failing to file proofs of claim on or before the date so fixed may be barred by order of court from participating in the distribution of the assets of the corporation.
