Attendance of a director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting except when a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

<P>&#9;Unless prohibited by the articles of incorporation or bylaws, and subject to provisions therein relating to notice, members of the board of directors or any committee designated thereby may participate in a meeting of the board or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communication equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can simultaneously hear each other.  Participation by this means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. [L 1985, c 270, pt of §1; am L 1987, c 135, §156]</P>
