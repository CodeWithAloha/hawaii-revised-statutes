<P>&#9;(b)  The commissioner may waive, on a case-by-case basis, the federal statewide concentration limits under section 44(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; provided that the commissioner shall apply a standard that does not discriminate against out-of-state banks.  In granting a waiver, the commissioner shall consider whether the waiver promotes the availability of financial services, the marketability of Hawaii banks, or another public interest.  This section shall not affect the applicability, if any, of federal or state antitrust law. [L 1996, c 155, pt of §1]</P>
