<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§412:12-109]  Enforcement.</B>  If the commissioner determines that a branch maintained by an out-of-state state bank in this State is being operated in violation of any provision of the laws of this State, or that the branch is being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner, the commissioner may take all enforcement actions as the commissioner could take if the branch were a Hawaii state bank; provided that the commissioner shall promptly give notice to the home state regulator of each enforcement action taken against an out-of-state state bank and, to the extent practicable, shall consult and cooperate with the home state regulator in pursuing and resolving the enforcement action.  The enforcement and supervisory powers of the commissioner contained in parts III to VI, article 2 of this chapter shall apply to an out-of-state state bank to the same extent that the provisions are applicable to a Hawaii financial institution. [L 1996, c 155, pt of §1]</P>
