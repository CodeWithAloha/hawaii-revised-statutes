<P>&#9;(b)&#9;(1)  An interstate merger transaction resulting in the acquisition by an out-of-state bank of a Hawaii state bank, or of all or substantially all of the branches of a Hawaii state bank, shall not be permitted under this article unless the Hawaii state bank shall have been in continuous operation, on the date of such acquisition, for a period of at least five years.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;For purposes of paragraph (1), a Hawaii state bank chartered solely for the purpose of acquiring another Hawaii state bank is considered to have been in existence for the same period as the Hawaii state bank to be acquired, so long as it does not open for business at any time before the acquisition.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The commissioner may waive the restriction in paragraph (1) in the case of a Hawaii state bank that is subject to, or is in danger of becoming subject to supervisory action under article 2 of this chapter or, if applicable, the equivalent provisions of federal law.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  Any out-of-state bank that will be the resulting bank pursuant to an interstate merger transaction involving a Hawaii state bank shall notify the commissioner of the proposed merger not later than the date on which it files an application for an interstate merger transaction with the responsible federal bank supervisory agency, and shall submit a copy of that application to the commissioner and pay a filing fee of $9,000, or a greater amount as the commissioner may establish by rule pursuant to chapter 91.  The filing fee shall be nonrefundable.  Any Hawaii state bank which is a party to an interstate merger transaction shall comply with part VI, article 3, of this chapter to the extent applicable, and with other applicable state and federal laws.  If the resulting bank in the interstate merger transaction is an out-of-state state bank, the director of commerce and consumer affairs shall not file the articles of merger until the out-of-state state bank has filed a confirmation in writing by the commissioner of compliance with this section.  If the resulting bank in the interstate merger transaction is an out-of-state bank which is a national banking association, the resulting bank shall file with the director of commerce and consumer affairs a confirmation in writing by the commissioner of compliance with this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Any out-of-state state bank which shall be the resulting bank in an interstate merger transaction involving a Hawaii bank shall provide satisfactory evidence to the commissioner of compliance with applicable requirements of chapter 415 relating to foreign corporations.
