Whenever the amount of surplus established herein becomes impaired, it shall be built up again to the required amount in the manner provided for its original accumulation.  Net earnings and surplus shall be determined by the board of directors, after providing for such reserves as the directors deem desirable, and the directors' determination made in good faith shall be conclusive on all persons.
