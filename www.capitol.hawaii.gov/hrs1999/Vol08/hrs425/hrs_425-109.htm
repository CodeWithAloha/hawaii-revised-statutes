For new provision, see below.]</I>  (1)  Every partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business, and the act of every partner, including the execution in the partnership name of any instrument, for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the partnership of which the partner is a member binds the partnership, unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter, and the person with whom the partner is dealing has knowledge of the fact that the partner has no such authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)  An act of a partner which is not apparently for the carrying on of the business of the partnership in the usual way does not bind the partnership unless authorized by the other partners.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  Unless authorized by the other partners or unless they have abandoned the business, one or more but less than all the partners have no authority to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

For present provision, see above.]</I>  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit forms a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  An association formed under a statute other than this part, a predecessor statute, or a comparable statute of another jurisdiction is not a partnership under this part.</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A person who receives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business, unless the profits were received in payment:</P><DIR>
