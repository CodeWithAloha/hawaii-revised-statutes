<P>  Inter-Relationships of Partners and Property Rights of Partners Under the UPA, 9 HBJ 88.</P>

<P>&#9;<B>[§425-118]  Rules determining rights and duties of partners. </B> <I>[Repealed July 1, 2000.  For new provision, see below.]</I>  The rights and duties of the partners in relation to the partnership shall be determined, subject to any agreement between them, by the following rules:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(a)&#9;Each partner shall be repaid the partner's contributions, whether by way of capital or advances to the partnership property and share equally in the profits and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including those to partners, are satisfied; and must contribute towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the partnership according to the partner's share in the profits.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;The partnership must indemnify every partner in respect of payments made and personal liabilities reasonably incurred by the partner in the ordinary and proper conduct of its business, or for the preservation of its business or property.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)&#9;A partner, who in aid of the partnership makes any payment or advance beyond the amount of capital which the partner agreed to contribute, shall be paid interest from the date of the payment or advance.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)&#9;A partner shall receive interest on the capital contributed by the partner only from the date when repayment should be made.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)&#9;All partners have equal rights in the management and conduct of the partnership business.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)&#9;No partner is entitled to remuneration for acting in the partnership business, except that a surviving partner is entitled to reasonable compensation for the surviving partner's services in winding up the partnership affairs.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)&#9;No person can become a member of a partnership without the consent of all the partners.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)&#9;Any difference arising as to ordinary matters connected with the partnership business may be decided by a majority of the partners; but no act in contravention of any agreement between the partners may be done rightfully without the consent of all the partners. [L 1972, c 17, §18; gen ch 1985]</P>

<P>&#9;<B>§425-118  Actions by and against partnership and partners.</B>  <I>[Section effective July 1, 2000.  For present provision, see above.]</I>  (a)  A partnership may sue and be sued in the name of the partnership.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  An action may be brought against the partnership and, to the extent not inconsistent with section 425-117, any or all of the partners in the same action or in separate actions.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  A judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner.  A judgment against a partnership shall not be satisfied from a partner's assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A judgment creditor of a partner shall not levy execution against the assets of the partner to satisfy a judgment based on a claim against the partnership unless the partner is personally liable for the claim under section 425-117 and:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The partner has agreed that the creditor need not exhaust partnership assets;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;A court grants permission to the judgment creditor to levy execution against the assets of a partner based on a finding that partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of partnership assets is excessively burdensome, or that the grant of permission is an appropriate exercise of the court's equitable powers; or</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Liability is imposed on the partner by law or contract independent of the existence of the partnership.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(e)  This section applies to any partnership liability or obligation resulting from a representation by a partner or purported partner under section 425-119. [L 1999, c 284, pt of §1]</P>
