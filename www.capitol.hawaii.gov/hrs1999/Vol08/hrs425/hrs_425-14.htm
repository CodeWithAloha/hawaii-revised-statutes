<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§425-14  Cancellation of registration.</B>  (a)  If any general partnership fails or neglects for a period of two years to file any annual statement as required by this part, the director of commerce and consumer affairs may cancel the registration or the certificate, as the case may be, of such partnership.  The cancellation of such registration or certificate shall not relieve the partners of liability for the penalties for the failure to file any statement or certificates required by this part.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Within two years after the involuntary cancellation of a general partnership under this section, the registration statement of the general partnership may be reinstated by the director upon written application executed by any partner of the general partnership setting forth such information as the director may require, and the payment of all delinquent fees, penalties, assessments, taxes, costs of involuntary cancellation, and the filing of all statements due and unfiled.  Within the applicable reinstatement period, should the name of the general partnership, or a name substantially identical thereto be registered or reserved by another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or limited liability partnership, or should such name or a name substantially identical thereto be registered as a trade name, trademark, or service mark, then reinstatement shall be allowed only upon the registration of a new name by the general partnership pursuant to the amendment provisions of this chapter.
