<P>&#9;(3)&#9;That the foreign limited liability partnership surrenders its authority to transact business in this State;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;That the foreign limited liability partnership revokes the authority of its registered agent in this State to accept service of process, and consents that service of process in any action, suit, or proceeding based upon any cause of action arising in this State during the time the partnership was authorized to transact business in this State may thereafter be made on the partnership by service thereof on the director;</P>

<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The dates that notice of the foreign limited liability partnership's intent to withdraw from the State was published, once in each of four successive weeks (four publications) in a newspaper of general circulation published in the State.

No partnership may withdraw from this State without complying with the conditions of this section and until compliance, service of legal notices and processes may be made on any agent of the partnership within the State.  If none can be found within the State, and in case the partnership, if a foreign limited liability partnership, has not filed with the director pursuant to section 425-155, the name of a person upon whom legal notice and process from the courts of the State may be served, and likewise if the person so named is not found within the State, service may be made upon the partnership by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to a partner of the partnership at its principal office.

</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  Nothing in this section shall limit or affect the right to serve any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served upon a partnership in any other manner permitted by law. [L 1996, c 93, pt of §1]</P>
