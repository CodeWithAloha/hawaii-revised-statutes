<B><P>&#9;§425-114  Partnership registration statement.</B>  <I>[Section effective July 1, 2000.  For present provision, see above.]  </I>(a)  A filed registration statement supplements the authority of a partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority contained in a filed registration statement is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not then contained in the filed registration statement.  A filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed registration statement recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that authority is not then of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property.  The recording in the bureau of conveyances of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  A person not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if a certified copy of the filed registration statement containing the limitation on authority is of record in the bureau of conveyances.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (a) and (b) and sections 425-136 and 425-142, a person not a partner is not deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed registration statement. [L 1999, c 284, pt of §1]</P>
