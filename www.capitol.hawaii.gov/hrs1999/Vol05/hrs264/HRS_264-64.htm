In this connection, the director may divide and separate any controlled-access facility into separate roadways by the construction of raised curbing, central dividing sections, or other physical separations, or by designating the separate roadways by signs, markers, stripes, and the proper lane for the traffic by appropriate signs, markers, stripes, and other devices.</P>
<P>&#9;No person shall have any right of ingress or egress to, from, or across controlled-access facilities to or from abutting lands, except at the designated points at which access may be permitted, upon such terms and conditions as may be specified by the director.  Any person who violates this section shall be fined not more than $250 or imprisoned not more than three months, or both. [L 1960, c 3, pt of §2; Supp, §111-45; HRS §264-64; gen ch 1985]</P>
