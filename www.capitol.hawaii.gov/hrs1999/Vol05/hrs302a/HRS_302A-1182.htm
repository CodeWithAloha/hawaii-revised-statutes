</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  Any public school or schools may form a new century charter school by establishing a local school board as its governing body composed of, at a minimum, one representative from each of the following participant groups:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Principals;</P>

<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The community at-large.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  The local school board shall formulate and develop a detailed implementation plan, which shall include but not be limited to the following:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;A description of the administrative and educational framework, and which provides for the basic protection of employees and their reasonable academic freedoms;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A plan for identifying, recruiting, and selecting students to make certain that student participation is not exclusive, elitist, or segregationalist;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;A plan for assessing student performance that focuses upon the established state educational performance standards, has at least equivalent rigor of standards and technical quality, as well as any other specific student outcomes to be achieved, and making this plan accountable to the general public;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The curriculum, instructional framework, and assessment mechanisms to be used to achieve student outcomes;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;A plan to hold the school, its faculty, and staff (collectively and individually) accountable in at least an equivalent manner as are other public schools throughout the State;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;A governance structure of the school;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;A facilities management plan that is consistent with the state facilities plan; provided that if the facilities management plan includes use of existing school facilities, the new century charter school shall receive authorization from the administrator responsible for the facilities; provided further that the final determination of use shall be under the discretion of the board; and</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Annual financial and program audits.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;The detailed implementation plan shall be approved by sixty per cent of the school's existing administrative, support, and teaching personnel, and parents; provided that the school personnel may request their bargaining unit representative to certify and conduct the elections for their respective bargaining units.  Once approved, the detailed implementation plan shall be submitted to the board for review.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The board shall have thirty days to review the completed implementation plan for the proposed new century charter school to assure its compliance with subsection (c) and section 302A-1184.  Unless the board finds that the plan conflicts with subsection (c) or section 302A-1184, the governor, the superintendent, and the board shall issue a charter designating the proposed new century charter school as a new century charter school within thirty days, and the proposed implementation plan shall be converted to a written performance contract between the school and the board.  If, within thirty days after the submission of the plan, the board finds a conflict with subsection (c) or section 302A-1184, it shall notify the local school board of the finding in writing to enable the local school board to appropriately amend the plan to resolve the conflict.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The new century charter schools shall not charge tuition.  The State shall afford the local school board of any new century charter school the same protections as the State affords to the board. [L 1999, c 62, pt of §2]</P>
