<P>&#9;(b)  The board shall organize and conduct a program of public pregrade education to the extent that funds provided therefor by the United States government are, or from time to time may become, available.  In establishing and carrying on the pregrade education, any such federal funds shall be expended during any school year as nearly as practicable in each of the school supervisory districts of the State in the proportion that the number of inhabitants of each district of less than six years of age bears to the total number of the inhabitants of the entire State within the age limits, as shown by the latest report of the department of health preceding the opening of the school year.
