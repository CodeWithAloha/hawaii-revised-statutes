<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;[§302A-1186]  New century charter schools; self-evaluation.</B>  (a)  Every new century charter school shall conduct self-evaluations annually.  The self-evaluation process shall include but not be limited to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The identification and adoption of benchmarks to measure and evaluate administrative and instructional programs as provided in this section;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The identification of any administrative and legal barriers to meeting the benchmarks, as adopted, and recommendations for improvements and modifications to address the barriers; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The impact of any changes made upon the students of the new century charter school.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Every new century charter school shall submit a report of its self-evaluation to the board within sixty days after the completion of the school year; provided that the department shall have thirty days to respond to any recommendation regarding improvements and modifications that would directly impact the department.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The board shall initiate an independent evaluation of each new century charter school four years after its establishment and every four years thereafter to assure compliance with statewide student performance standards and fiscal accountability; provided that each new century charter school established prior to July 1, 1998, shall be evaluated four years after July 1, 1998, and every four years thereafter.  Upon a determination by the board that student achievement within a new century charter school does not meet the student performance standards, or that the new century charter school is not fiscally responsible, a new century charter school shall be placed on probationary status and shall have two years to bring student performance into compliance with statewide standards and improve the school's fiscal accountability.  If a new century charter school fails to meet its probationary requirements, or fails to comply with any of the requirements of this section, the board, upon a two-thirds majority vote, may then deny the continuation of the new century charter school.
