<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§317-1  Purpose.</B>  The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the establishment of an annual conference of secondary school students, (grades seven to twelve) which will enable students in our secondary schools to identify, discuss, and arrive at recommended solutions to major youth problems, with emphasis on school problems that require the attention and joint action by the students, the department of education, and the legislature.  The conference format may be a state student conference, a student governance summit, or district-centered conferences as determined by the student conference committee.
