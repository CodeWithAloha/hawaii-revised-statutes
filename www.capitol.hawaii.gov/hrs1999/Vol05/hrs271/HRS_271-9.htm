<P>&#9;(c)  Upon complaint in writing to the commission by any person or body politic, or upon its own initiative without complaint, the commission may investigate whether any motor carrier has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, or with any regulation, requirements, or order established or issued pursuant thereto.  If the commission, after notice and hearing as prescribed in section 271-31, finds upon any investigation that the motor carrier has failed to comply with any provision, regulation, requirements, or order, the commission shall issue an appropriate order to compel the carrier to comply therewith.  Whenever the commission is of the opinion that any complaint does not state reasonable grounds for investigation and action on its part, it may dismiss the complaint.
