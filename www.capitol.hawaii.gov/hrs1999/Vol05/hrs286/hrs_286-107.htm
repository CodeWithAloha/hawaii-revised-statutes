<P>&#9;(b)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), an applicant for a renewal of a driver's license under this section, or the reactivation of an expired license under section 286-107.5(a), shall appear in person before the examiner of drivers and the examiner of drivers shall administer such physical examinations as the state director of transportation deems necessary to determine the applicant's fitness to continue to operate a motor vehicle.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Any resident of this State who holds a category (1), (2) or (3) license and who by reason of the resident's temporary absence from the State is unable to appear in person before the examiner of drivers to apply for a renewal of the resident's driver's license, may, if the resident is not disqualified from renewing the resident's license under subsection (a), apply for a renewal by mail.

The examiner of drivers shall upon receipt of the request, furnish the applicant with all necessary forms and instructions.  An application for renewal made pursuant to this subsection shall be accompanied by a statement from a licensed physician certifying that the applicant had been examined by the licensed physician not more than six months prior to the expiration date of the applicant's license and that the applicant had been found by such examination to have met the physical requirements established by the state director of transportation for the renewal of licenses.
