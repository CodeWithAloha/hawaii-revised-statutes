<P>&#9;(b)  The test or tests shall be administered at the request of a police officer having probable cause to believe the person driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle or moped upon the public highways is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, or is under the age of twenty-one and has a measurable amount of alcohol concentration, only after:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  If there is probable cause to believe that a person is in violation of section 291-4 or section 291-4.3, then the person shall have the option to take a breath or blood test, or both, for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If there is probable cause to believe that a person is in violation of section 291-7, then the person shall have the option to take a blood or urine test, or both, for the purpose of determining the drug content.  Drug content shall be measured by the presence of any scheduled drug as provided in section 291-7 or its metabolic products or both.  The person shall be informed of the sanctions of section 286-157.3 for failure to take either test.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  A person who chooses to submit to a breath test under subsection (c) also may be requested to submit to a blood or urine test, if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person was driving under the influence of any drug under section&nbsp;291-7 or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs and the officer has probable cause to believe that a blood or urine test will reveal evidence of the person being under the influence of drugs.  The officer shall state in the officer's report the facts upon which that belief is based.  The person shall have the option to take a blood or urine test, or both, for the purpose of determining the person's drug content.  Results of a blood or urine test conducted to determine drug content also shall be admissible for the purpose of determining the person's alcohol content.  Submission to testing for drugs under subsection (d) or this subsection shall not be a substitute for alcohol tests requested under subsection (c).
