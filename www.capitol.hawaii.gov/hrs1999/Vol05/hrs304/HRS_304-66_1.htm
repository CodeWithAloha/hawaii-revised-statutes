<P>  In this subpart, "department of public safety" substituted for "department of social services and housing" or "department of corrections"; "subpart" substituted for "Act".</P>

<P>&#9;<B>[§304</B>-<B>66.1  Findings and purpose.]</B>  The legislature finds that the limited supply of physicians and attractiveness of private practice inhibit the efforts of the department of health to provide primary medical care in certain rural communities of the State and lessens the ability of the department of public safety to recruit physicians to serve in correctional facilities.  The legislature further finds that an opportunity should be made available to attract physicians to fill positions in the department of health and department of public safety.</P>
<P>&#9;The purpose of this subpart is to establish an innovative program which seeks to provide an opportunity for physicians to serve with the State and, consequently, ease the difficulty of the department of health and department of public safety in recruiting physicians.  This subpart does not change the standards of any medical residency program nor affect the existing relationship between the school of medicine and the various hospitals that take part in any residency program.
