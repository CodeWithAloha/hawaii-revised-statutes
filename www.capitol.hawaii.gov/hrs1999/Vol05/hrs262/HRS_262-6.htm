The regulations shall be reasonable and none shall impose any requirement or restriction which is not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.  In determining what regulations the director may adopt, the director of transportation shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain within the airport hazard area, the character of the neighborhood, and the uses to which the property to be zoned is put and adaptable.</P>
<P> &#9;(b)  Nonconforming uses.  No airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter shall require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use, except as provided in section 262-7. [L 1965, c 140, pt of §1; Supp, §17A-6; HRS §262-6; gen ch 1985]</P>
