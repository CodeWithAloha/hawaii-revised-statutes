<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The commission has issued an effective date for either a contingent final public report or a final public report on the project, and the developer has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the prospective purchaser, either personally or by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, a true copy of either the contingent final public report or the final public report together with a true copy of all prior public reports on the project, if any, which have not been previously delivered to such prospective purchaser; except that such prior public reports need not be delivered to the prospective purchaser if the contingent final public report or the final public report supersedes such prior public reports.  If, prior to the entering into of such contract or agreement for sale or resale, the commission has, subsequent to its issuance of an effective date for the contingent final public report or the final public report, issued an effective date for a supplementary public report on the project, then a true copy of such supplementary public report shall also be delivered to such prospective purchaser in the same manner as the contingent final public report or the final public report, except that if the supplementary public report supersedes all prior public reports on the project, then only the supplementary public report need be delivered to the prospective purchaser.</P>

</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  The receipts and notices taken hereunder shall be kept on file in possession of the developer (or such other person as may offer any apartment in a condominium project prior to completion of its construction), and shall be subject to inspection at a reasonable time by the commission or its deputies, for a period of three years from the date the receipt and notice was taken.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Unless such right has previously been waived pursuant to subsection (a), a prospective purchaser shall have the right to cancel any agreement for the purchase or reservation of an apartment at any time prior to the earlier of:</P><DIR>

<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The conveyance of the apartment to the prospective purchaser; or</P>
