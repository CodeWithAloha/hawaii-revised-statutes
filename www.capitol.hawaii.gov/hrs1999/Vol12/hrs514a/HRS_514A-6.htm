<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§514A-6  Separate taxation.</B>  The laws relating to home exemptions from state property taxes are applicable to the individual apartments, which shall have the benefit of home exemption in those cases where the owner of single-family dwelling would qualify.  Property taxes assessed by the State shall be assessed on and collected on the individual apartments and not on the property as a whole.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each apartment and the common interest appertaining thereto shall be deemed to be a parcel and shall be subject to separate assessment and taxation for all types of taxes authorized by law, including, but not limited to, special assessments.
