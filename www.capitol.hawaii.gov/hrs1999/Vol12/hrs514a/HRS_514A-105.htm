<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§514A-105  Sale of residential units.</B>  (a)  From the issuance of an effective date of the first public report until the developer has complied with section 514A-104, the developer shall offer all the residential units designated pursuant to section 514A-103 for sale only as set forth in section 514A-104; provided that notwithstanding this part, in the case of a project which includes one or more existing structures being converted to condominium status, each residential unit contained in the project shall first be offered for sale to any individual occupying the unit immediately prior to the conversion and who submits an owner-occupant affidavit and an earnest money deposit in a reasonable amount designated by the developer.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Each contract for the purchase of a designated residential unit by an owner-occupant may be conditioned upon the purchaser obtaining adequate financing, or a commitment for adequate financing, by a date which is no earlier than fifty calendar days after the developer's execution and acceptance of the sales contract, and if the financing or commitment is not obtained, the contract may be canceled by either the developer or the purchaser.  If the sales contract is so canceled, the developer shall re-offer the residential unit first to those prospective owner-occupants on the back-up reservation list who have not executed a sales contract for a residential unit in the project in the order in which their names appear on that list.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Any prospective owner-occupant who executes an affidavit as set forth in section 514A-104.5 and a sales contract for the sale of one of the designated residential units shall be required to reaffirm the person's intent to be an owner-occupant no earlier than the person's receipt for a final public report and no later than closing of escrow for the unit.  The developer may provide in its sales contract that failure to sign the reaffirmation upon reasonable request shall constitute a default under the sales contract by the person failing to sign.  The developer shall cancel the sales contract or reservation of any person failing to make the reaffirmation pursuant to this subsection and shall re-offer the residential unit first to those prospective owner-occupants on the back-up reservation list who have not executed a sales contract for a residential unit in the project, in the order in which their names appear on that list.  If the sales contract has become binding upon the purchaser pursuant to section 514A-62, the developer may exercise the remedies provided for in the sales contract and any other remedies provided by law.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Any prospective owner-occupant on the back-up reservation list, at any time, may be offered any residential unit in the project not subject to the designation required by section 514A-103.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The developer, escrow agent, or any other party, at the direction of the developer, shall mail twice to each owner-occupant by registered or certified mail, once by the sixtieth day and once by the two hundred seventieth day following the conveyance of the first unit to an owner-occupant listed on the final reservation list, a complete copy of the executed affidavit to inform them of their legal obligations and penalties as provided for in this part.</P>
<P>&#9;The developer shall keep records of its notice mailings and the owner-occupant affidavits for a period of three years starting from the date of its first mailing pursuant to this subsection and the date of the conveyance of the first unit to an owner-occupant listed on the final reservation list.  Failure of the developer to give the notices required by this subsection shall not affect title to the owner-occupant unit or the obligations of the owner-occupant pursuant to this part.
