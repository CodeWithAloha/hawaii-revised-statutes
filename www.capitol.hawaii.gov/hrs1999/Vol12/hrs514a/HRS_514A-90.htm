<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§514A-90  Priority of lien.</B>  (a)  All sums assessed by the association of apartment owners but unpaid for the share of the common expenses chargeable to any apartment constitute a lien on the apartment prior to all other liens, except:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Liens for taxes and assessments lawfully imposed by governmental authority against the apartment; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;All sums unpaid on any mortgage of record that was recorded prior to the recordation of a notice of a lien by the association of apartment owners, and costs and expenses including attorneys' fees provided in such mortgages.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The lien of the association of apartment owners may be foreclosed by action or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth in chapter 667, by the managing agent or board of directors, acting on behalf of the association of apartment owners, in like manner as a mortgage of real property.  In any such foreclosure the apartment owner shall be required to pay a reasonable rental for the apartment, if so provided in the bylaws, and the plaintiff in the foreclosure shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the rental owed.  The managing agent or board of directors, acting on behalf of the association of apartment owners, unless prohibited by the declaration, may bid on the apartment at foreclosure sale, and acquire and hold, lease, mortgage, and convey the apartment.  Action to recover a money judgment for unpaid common expenses shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the unpaid common expenses owed.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Where the mortgagee of a mortgage of record or other purchaser of an apartment obtains title to the apartment as a result of foreclosure of the mortgage, the acquirer of title and the acquirer's successors and assigns shall not be liable for the share of the common expenses or assessments by the association of apartment owners chargeable to the apartment which became due prior to the acquisition of title to the apartment by the acquirer.  The unpaid share of common expenses or assessments shall be deemed to be common expenses collectible from all of the apartment owners, including the acquirer and the acquirer's successors and assigns.  The mortgagee of record or other purchaser of the apartment shall be deemed to acquire title and shall be required to pay the apartment's share of common expenses and assessments beginning:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Thirty-six days after the order confirming the sale to the purchaser has been filed with the court;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Sixty days after the hearing at which the court grants the motion to confirm the sale to the purchaser; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Upon the recording of the deed,</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>whichever occurs first.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No apartment owner shall withhold any assessment claimed by the association.  An apartment owner who disputes the amount of an assessment may request a written statement clearly indicating:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The amount of common expenses included in the assessment, including the due date of each amount claimed;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The amount of any penalty, late fee, lien filing fee, and any other charge included in the assessment;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The amount of attorneys' fees and costs, if any, included in the assessment;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;That under Hawaii law, an apartment owner has no right to withhold assessments for any reason;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;That an apartment owner has a right to demand mediation or arbitration to resolve disputes about the amount or validity of an association's assessment, provided the apartment owner immediately pays the assessment in full and keeps assessments current; and</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;That payment in full of the assessment does not prevent the owner from contesting the assessment or receiving a refund of amounts not owed.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of an owner to the protection of all fair debt collection procedures mandated under federal and state law.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  An apartment owner who pays an association the full amount claimed by the association may file in small claims court or require the association to mediate to resolve any disputes concerning the amount or validity of the association's claim.  If the apartment owner and the association are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation, either party may file for arbitration under part VII; provided that an apartment owner may only file for arbitration if all amounts claimed by the association are paid in full on or before the date of filing.  If the apartment owner fails to keep all association assessments current during the arbitration, the association may ask the arbitrator to temporarily suspend the arbitration proceedings.  If the apartment owner pays all association assessments within thirty days of the date of suspension, the apartment owner may ask the arbitrator to recommence the arbitration proceedings.  If the owner fails to pay all association assessments by the end of the thirty-day period, the association may ask the arbitrator to dismiss the arbitration proceedings.  The apartment owner shall be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid to the association which are not owed.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  As an alternative to foreclosure proceedings under subsection (a), where an apartment is owner-occupied, the association of apartment owners may authorize its managing agent or board of directors to, after sixty days' written notice to the apartment owner and to the apartment's first mortgagee of the nonpayment of the apartment's share of the common expenses, terminate the delinquent apartment's access to the common elements and cease supplying a delinquent apartment with any and all services normally supplied or paid for by the association of apartment owners.  Any terminated services and privileges shall be restored upon payment of all delinquent assessments.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Before the board of directors or managing agent may take the actions permitted under subsection (e), the board must adopt a written policy providing for such actions and have the policy approved by a majority vote of the apartment owners at an annual or special meeting of the association or by the written consent of a majority of the apartment owners.
