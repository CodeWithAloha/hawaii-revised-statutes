However, if such information materially affects the value of the residential real property, the seller shall provide an amended disclosure statement to the buyer within ten calendar days after the seller's discovery of such information if the seller discovers such information prior to the recorded sale of the residential real property, and in any event, no later than twelve noon of the last business day prior to the recorded sale of the real property.  The buyer shall have fifteen calendar days to examine the amended disclosure statement and, if the buyer was not already aware of such information, may rescind real estate purchase contract in accordance with section 508D-5.
