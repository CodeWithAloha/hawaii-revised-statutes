After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by this article.  After distribution, a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in section 560:3-1004 or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in section 560:3-1005.  This section has no application to a proceeding by a secured creditor of the decedent to enforce the creditor's right to the creditor's security except as to any deficiency judgment which might be sought therein.
