A protected person seeking termination is entitled to the same rights and procedures as in an original proceeding for a protective order.  The court, upon determining that the minority or disability of the protected person has ceased, may terminate the guardianship.  Upon termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the former protected person or to the person's successors subject to provision in the order for expenses of administration or to conveyances from the guardian of the property to the former protected person or the person's successors, to evidence the transfer.
