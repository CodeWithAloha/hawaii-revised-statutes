<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§560:5-419  Accounts.</B>  Every guardian of the property must account to the court for the guardian's administration of the guardianship upon the guardian's resignation or removal, on termination of the protected person's minority or disability, and periodically for such periods and at such times as the court may direct.  Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a guardian of the property, adjudicates as to the guardian's liabilities concerning the matters considered in connection therewith; and an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing a final account adjudicates as to all previously unsettled liabilities of the guardian of the property to the protected person or the person's successors relating to the guardianship.  In connection with any account, the court may require a guardian of the property to submit to a physical check of the estate in the guardian's control, to be made in any manner the court may specify.
