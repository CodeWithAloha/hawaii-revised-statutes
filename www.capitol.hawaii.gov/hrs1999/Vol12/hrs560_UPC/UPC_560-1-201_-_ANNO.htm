<P>  Appellant was not an "interested person", as defined in this section, who could petition the court under §560:3-614 for appointment as special administrator where appellant had no familial relationship to decedent’s family, did not have a property right or claim against decedent’s estate, and did not have priority under §560:3-203 to be appointed as personal representative of decedent’s estate; circuit court thus properly denied appellant’s petition.  88 H. 148, 963 P.2d 1124.</P>
