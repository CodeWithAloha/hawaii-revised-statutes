<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§576D-10.5  Liens.</B>  (a)  Whenever any obligor through judicial or administrative process in this State or any other state has been ordered to pay an allowance for the support, maintenance, or education of a child, or for the support and maintenance of a spouse or former spouse in conjunction with child support, and the obligor becomes delinquent in those payments, a lien shall arise on the obligor's real and personal property and the obligor's real and personal property shall be subject to foreclosure, distraint, seizure and sale, or order to withhold and deliver, which shall be executed in accordance with applicable state law.  No judicial notice or hearing shall be necessary prior to creation of such a lien.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Whenever the dependents of the obligor receive public assistance moneys, the child support enforcement agency or its designated counsel may establish the public assistance debt through an appropriate judicial or administrative proceeding.  Upon the establishment of the public assistance debt, it shall be subject to collection action, and the real and personal property of the obligor shall be subject to lien and foreclosure, distraint, seizure and sale, or order to withhold and deliver.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The child support order or judgment filed through judicial or administrative proceedings in this State or any other state shall be recorded in the bureau of conveyances.  The recordation of the order or judgment in the bureau of conveyances shall be deemed, at such time, for all purposes and without any further action, to procure a lien on land registered in the land court under chapter 501.  The lien shall become effective immediately upon recordation of the child support order and shall attach to all interests in real or personal property then owned or subsequently acquired by the obligor including any interests not recorded with the bureau of conveyances or filed in the land court.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  No fee shall be charged the child support enforcement agency or its designated counsel for recording or filing of the liens provided for in this section or for the recording or filing of any releases requested in conjunction with the liens.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Any lien provided for by this section shall take priority over any lien subsequently acquired or recorded except tax liens.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  The lien shall be enforceable by the child support enforcement agency or its designated counsel or by the obligee by suit in the appropriate court or by bringing an action in an administrative tribunal or shall be enforceable as a claim against the estate of the obligor or by any lawful means of collection.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  The child support enforcement agency, its designated counsel or the obligee, where appropriate, shall issue certificates of release upon satisfaction of the lien.  Certificates of release of any real property shall be recorded in the bureau of conveyances or filed in the office of the assistant registrar of the land court.  Recordation of the certificate of release shall be the responsibility of the obligor. [L 1989, c 304, §1; am L 1995, c 137, §2; am L 1997, c 293, §29]</P></FONT></BODY>
