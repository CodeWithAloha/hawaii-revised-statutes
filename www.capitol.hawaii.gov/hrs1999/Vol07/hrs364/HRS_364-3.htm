<P>&#9;Prior to the sale of a veterans mortgage the mortgagee shall certify to the effect that no default or defaults exist and that the mortgagee knows of no existing condition affecting the mortgagor or the mortgagor's affairs which in the opinion of the mortgagee will cause the veterans mortgage to become delinquent.</P>
<P>&#9;The director of finance may, by rule and regulation, establish such other minimum requirements which must be met by veterans mortgages to qualify for purchase, as are conducive to carrying out this chapter and are not in conflict therewith.
