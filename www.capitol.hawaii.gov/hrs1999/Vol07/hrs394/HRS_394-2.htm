Where a need is indicated to overcome barriers to possible training, the department of labor and industrial relations, either on its own or in cooperation with the various departments and agencies of the state and county governments and private industry, may arrange for transportation, child care, health care and other aids to employment.  The department of labor and industrial relations is also authorized to formulate and carry out a program of providing useful public service employment to unemployed persons other than public assistance recipients.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The department of human services is authorized to formulate and carry out a program of providing useful public service employment to public assistance recipients.  Refusal to accept suitable work as determined by the department of human services without justifiable reasons shall render an unemployed or underemployed recipient ineligible for public assistance.
