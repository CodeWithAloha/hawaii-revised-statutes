<P>  Where department has a TDI plan for its full-time teachers and a TDI plan for A+ employees, and an individual is employed by department as both a full-time teacher and an A+ employee and becomes disabled for both jobs, allowing department to pay only under one TDI plan would produce a harsh result that is contrary to the legislative intent to provide benefits commensurate with wage loss from all employments and this section's command to construe the statute "liberally ... in the light of the stated reasons for its enactment".  Att. Gen. Op. 97-9.</P>
