<P>  Where department essentially has two TDI plans (full-time teachers are covered by a plan approved by DLIR pursuant to subsection (a)(5), and department's A+ and other employees are paid benefits in accordance with TDI law found in chapter 392), if an individual is employed by department as both a full-time teacher and an A+ employee and the individual becomes disabled for both jobs, the department must pay the individual under both TDI plans.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-9.</P>
