<P>  As §706-670 and this section can be given effect without conflict, §706-670(7) is not the "exclusive" law governing parole revocations, does not embrace the entire law on the subject, and does not repeal this section by implication.  88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162.</P>
<P>  The no-hearing requirement for revocation of parole does not only apply to convictions of violations of state law.  88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162.</P>
