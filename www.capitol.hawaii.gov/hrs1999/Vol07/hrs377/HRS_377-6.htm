<P>&#9;(2)&#9;To initiate, create, dominate, or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial support to it, but an employer shall not be prohibited from reimbursing employees at their prevailing wage rate for time spent conferring with the employer, nor from cooperating with representatives of at least a majority of the employer's employees in a collective bargaining unit, at their request, by permitting employee organizational activities on employer premises or the use of employer facilities where the activities or use create no additional expense to the employer;</P>

No employer shall justify any discrimination against any employee for nonmembership in a labor organization if the employer has reasonable grounds for believing that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Or that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition for acquiring or retaining membership;</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;To refuse to bargain collectively with the representative of a majority of the employer's employees in any collective bargaining unit provided that if the employer has good faith doubt that a union represents a majority of the employees, the employer may file a representation petition for an election and shall not be deemed guilty of refusal to bargain;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;To bargain collectively with the representatives of less than a majority of the employer's employees in a collective bargaining unit, or to enter into an all-union agreement except in the manner provided in paragraph (3);</P>
