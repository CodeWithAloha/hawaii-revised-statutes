<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§393</B>-<B>7  Required health care benefits.</B>  (a)  A prepaid health care plan shall qualify as a plan providing the mandatory health care benefits required under this chapter if it provides for health care benefits equal to, or medically reasonably substitutable for, the benefits provided by prepaid health plans of the same type, as specified in section 393-12(a)(1) or (2), which have the largest numbers of subscribers in the State.  This applies to the types and quantity of benefits as well as to limitations on reimbursability, including deductibles, and to required amounts of co-insurance.</P>
