<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§386-204  Rates and reporting of rates.</B>  (a)  Every workers' compensation self-insurance group shall adhere to the uniform classification system, uniform experience rating plan, and manual rules filed with the insurance commissioner by an advisory organization designated by the insurance commissioner.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Premium contributions to the group shall be determined by applying the manual rates and rules to the appropriate classification of each member which shall be adjusted by each member's experience credit or debit.  Subject to approval by the insurance commissioner, premium contributions may also be reduced by an advance premium discount reflecting the group's expense levels and loss experience.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Notwithstanding subsection (b), a group may apply to the insurance commissioner for permission to make its own rates.  The rates shall be based on at least five years of the group's experience.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Each group shall be audited at least annually by an auditor acceptable to the insurance commissioner to verify proper classifications, experience rating, payroll, and rates.  A report of the audit shall be filed with the insurance commissioner in a form acceptable to the insurance commissioner.  A group or any member thereof may request a hearing on any objections to the classifications.  If the insurance commissioner determines that, as a result of an improper classification, a member's premium contribution is insufficient, the insurance commissioner shall order the group to assess that member an amount equal to the deficiency.  If the insurance commissioner determines that, as a result of an improper classification, a member's premium is excessive, the insurance commissioner shall order the group to refund to the member the excess collected.  The audit shall be at the expense of the group. [L 1986, c 304, pt of §1]</P>
