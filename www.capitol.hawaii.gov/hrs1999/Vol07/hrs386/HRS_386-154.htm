<P>&#9;"Employing unit" means an employer who has not secured compensation to the employer's employees under section 386-121(a)(1); except that, for employers who are members of a workers' compensation group under part VI, the term means the group.</P>
<P>&#9;"Average annual compensation" means the average of annual compensation payments made by an employing unit for a period consisting of two consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the year for which the charge is assessed under this section; provided that if, at the end of a calendar year, an employing unit was subject to this chapter for a period less than twelve consecutive months the total amount of compensation payments made by the employing unit during such period shall constitute the employing unit's average annual compensation.</P>
<P>&#9;"Employing unit's compensation ratio" means the percentage ratio derived by dividing an employing unit's average annual compensation at the end of a calendar year by the total average annual compensation paid during the same two calendar years by all employers subject to this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;"Carrier's compensation ratio" means the quotient derived by dividing the total average annual compensation paid during the two most recent calendar years by all insurance carriers on behalf of employers insured and keeping insured under section 386-121(a)(1) by the total average annual compensation paid during the same two calendar years by all employers subject to this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;"Anticipated total assessment" means the amount derived by dividing the total amount of the levy to be paid by insurance carriers in a calendar year as required by section 386-153 by the most recent carrier's compensation ratio.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  For the calendar year 1974 and for each calendar year thereafter an employing unit shall, except as otherwise provided in section 386-152, pay into the special compensation fund a charge in an amount which is equal to the product derived by multiplying the employing unit's most recent compensation ratio by the most recent anticipated total assessment.</P>
<P>&#9;For each calendar year the director shall determine the amount of the charge to be paid by each employing unit, and shall give notice of such charge to each employing unit by August&nbsp;15 of the year for which the charge is assessed.  The amount of the charge shall be paid to the director on or before September&nbsp;30 following notification.</P>
<P>&#9;The director of finance may withhold the additional charge due from a political subdivision from any moneys due the subdivision from the State if the subdivision has not paid its charge as required by this section and shall deposit the withheld amount in the special compensation fund.
