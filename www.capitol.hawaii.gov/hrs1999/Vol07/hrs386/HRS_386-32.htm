<P>&#9;Partial loss or loss of use of member named in schedule.  Where a work injury causes permanent partial disability resulting from partial loss of use of a member named in this schedule, and where the disability is not otherwise compensated in this schedule, compensation shall be paid for a period that stands in the same proportion to the period specified for the total loss or loss of use of the member as the partial loss or loss of use of that member stands to the total loss or loss of use thereof;</P>
<P>&#9;More than one finger or toe of same hand or foot.  In cases of permanent partial disability resulting from simultaneous injury to the thumb and one or more fingers of one hand, or to two or more fingers of one hand, or to the great toe and one or more toes other than the great toe of one foot, or to two or more toes other than the great toe of one foot, the disability may be rated as a partial loss or loss of use of the hand or the foot and the period of benefit payments shall be measured accordingly.  In no case shall the compensation for loss or loss of use of more than one finger or toe of the same hand or foot exceed the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a hand or foot;</P>
<P>&#9;Amputation.  Amputation between the elbow and the wrist shall be rated as the equivalent of the loss of a hand.

Amputation at or above the knee shall be rated as the loss of a leg;</P>
<P>&#9;Disfigurement.  In cases of personal injury resulting in disfigurement the director may award compensation not to exceed $30,000 as the director deems proper and equitable in view of the disfigurement.  Disfigurement shall be separate from other permanent partial disabilities and shall include scarring and other disfiguring consequences caused by medical, surgical, and hospital treatment of the employee;</P>
<P>&#9;Other cases.  In all other cases of permanent partial disability resulting from the loss or loss of use of a part of the body or from the impairment of any physical function, weekly benefits shall be paid at the rate and subject to the limitations specified in this subsection for a period that bears the same relation to a period named in the schedule as the disability sustained bears to a comparable disability named in the schedule.  In cases in which the permanent partial disability must be rated as a percentage of the total loss or impairment of a physical or mental function of the whole person, the maximum compensation shall be computed on the basis of the corresponding percentage of the product of three hundred twelve times the effective maximum weekly benefit rate prescribed in section 386-31.</P>
<P>&#9;Payment of compensation for permanent partial disability.  Compensation for permanent partial disability shall be paid in weekly installments at the rate of sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the worker's average weekly wage, subject to the limitations on weekly benefit rates prescribed in section 386-31.</P>
<P>&#9;Unconditional nature and time of commencement of payment.  Compensation for permanent partial disability shall be paid regardless of the earnings of the disabled employee subsequent to the injury.  Payments shall not commence until after termination of any temporary total disability that may be caused by the injury.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Temporary partial disability.  Where a work injury causes partial disability, not determined to be permanent, which diminishes the employee's capacity for work, the employer, beginning with the first day of the disability and during the continuance thereof, shall pay the injured employee weekly benefits equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the difference between the employee's average weekly wages before the injury and the employee's weekly earnings thereafter, subject to the schedule for the maximum and minimum weekly benefit rates prescribed in section 386-31.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Provisions common to permanent and temporary partial disability.  No determination of partial disability shall be made until two weeks from the date of the injury.
