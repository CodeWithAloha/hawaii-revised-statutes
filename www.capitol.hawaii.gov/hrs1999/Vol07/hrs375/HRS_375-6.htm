<P>&#9;(b)  Each industrial homeworker shall be furnished by the employer with a sample of the work to be performed to which is affixed a notation of the applicable piece-work rate, and which sample is to be present in the place where the industrial homework is performed.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No employer shall deliver or cause to be delivered any materials or articles to be manufactured by any industrial homeworker unless there has been conspicuously affixed to each article or material a label or other mark of identification bearing the employer's name and address, printed or written legibly in English.  But if the goods are of such a nature that they cannot be individually labeled or identified, then the employer shall conspicuously label the goods in such manner as the director of labor and industrial relations may by rule or regulation prescribe.
