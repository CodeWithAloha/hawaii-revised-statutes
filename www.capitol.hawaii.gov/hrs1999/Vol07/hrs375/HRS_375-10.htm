<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§375-10  Records and reports.</B>  (a)  The issuance of a certificate shall not relieve the employer of the duty of maintaining the records required by rule XIII of the department of labor and industrial relations and of chapter 387 and failure to keep the records shall be sufficient cause for revocation or cancellation of certificates issued to such an employer.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  In addition to compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of rule XIII of the department and chapter 387, a separate handbook (to be obtained by the employer from the department and supplied by the employer to each worker) shall be kept for each homeworker.  The information required therein shall be entered by the employer or the person distributing or collecting homework on behalf of the employer each time work is given out to or received from a homeworker.  Except for the time necessary for the making of entries by the employer, the handbook must remain in the possession of the homeworker until such time as the department may request it.  Upon completion of the handbook (that is, no space remains for additional entries) or termination of the homeworker's services the handbook shall be returned to the employer for preservation in accordance with rule XIII of the department.  A separate record and a separate handbook shall be kept for each person performing homework. [L 1959, c 53, §10; am L Sp 1959 2d, c 1, §27; Supp, §96A-10; HRS §375-10; gen ch 1985]</P>
