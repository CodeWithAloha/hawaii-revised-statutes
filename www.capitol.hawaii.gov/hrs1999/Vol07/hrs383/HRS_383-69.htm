<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§383-69  Procedure for rate determination.</B>  The department of labor and industrial relations shall as soon as is reasonably possible in each period make its classification of employers for such period and notify each employer of the employer's rate of contributions for such period as determined pursuant to sections 383-63 to 383-69.  The determination shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer unless, within fifteen days after the mailing of notice thereof to the employer's last known address, or in the absence of mailing within fifteen days after the delivery of the notice to the employer, the employer files an application for review and redetermination, setting forth the employer's reasons therefor.  If the department grants the review, the employer shall be promptly notified thereof and shall be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing, but no employer shall have standing, in any proceeding involving the employer's rate of contributions or contribution liability, to contest the chargeability to the employer's account of any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination, or decision pursuant to sections 383-31 to 383-43 except upon the grounds that the services on the basis of which the benefits were found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in employment for the employer and only in the event that the employer was not a party to the determination, redetermination, or decision or to any other proceedings under this chapter in which the character of the services was determined.  The employer shall be promptly notified of the department's denial of the employer's application, or of the department's redetermination, both of which shall become final unless a proceeding for judicial review in the manner provided in chapter 91 is commenced in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the employer resides or has the employer's principal place of business or in the circuit court of the first judicial circuit.  The proceedings shall be heard in a summary manner and shall be given precedence over all other civil actions except proceedings arising under section 383-41 and the workers' compensation law of the State.  An appeal may be taken from the decision of the circuit court to the supreme court.
