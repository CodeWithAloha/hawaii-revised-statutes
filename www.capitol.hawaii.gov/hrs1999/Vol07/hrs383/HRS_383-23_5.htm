<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;By one-half the prorated weekly amount of the pension if at least half but less than one hundred per cent of the contributions to the plan were provided by such individual; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;By the entire prorated weekly amount of the pension if paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) does not apply; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;By no part of the pension if the entire contributions to the plan were provided by such individual, or by the individual and an employer (or any other person or organization) who is not a base period or chargeable employer as determined under applicable law.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  No reduction shall be made under this section by reason of the receipt of a pension if the services performed by the individual during the base period (or remuneration received for such services) for such employer did not affect the individual's eligibility for, or increase the amount of, such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or similar payment.  The conditions specified by this subsection shall not apply to pensions paid under the federal Social Security Act or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or the corresponding provisions of prior law.  Payments made under those Acts shall be treated solely in the manner specified by subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3). [L 1980, c 117, §1; am L 1981, c 196, §1]</P>
