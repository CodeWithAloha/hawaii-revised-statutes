<P>  Use at sentencing of statements previously obtained in violation of a defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination violates that defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination and right to due process.  74 H. 424, 848 P.2d 376.</P>
<P>  Third-party agreements homestead lessees entered into with third party non-Hawaiian farmers could not be considered property interests.  76 H. 128, 870 P.2d 1272.</P>
<P>  Appellant had a right under the due process clause, to be given reasonable notice of the circuit court’s intention to apply §706-660.1(a) (1985) in sentencing appellant in connection with kidnapping conviction and to be afforded the opportunity to be heard with respect thereto.  76 H. 517, 880 P.2d  192.</P>
<P>  Coercive conduct of a private person may be sufficient to render a confession inadmissible based on this section and article I, §10 of Hawai`i constitution.  77 H. 51, 881 P.2d 538.</P>
<P>  Because appellants had been afforded an adequate opportunity to challenge the fine assessed by department of land utilization on appeal--at both administrative and judicial levels--before they incurred any obligation to pay it, the application of the procedural mechanism set forth in section of land use ordinance had not violated their right to due process of law.  77 H. 168, 883 P.2d 629.</P>
<P>  Supreme court declined to hold that State must tape record a custodial interrogation in order to establish a valid waiver of a criminal defendant’s constitutional rights.  77 H. 403, 886 P.2d 740.</P>
<P>  Presumption of nonconsent imposed on appellant a burden of persuasion of the nonexistence of an essential element of the crime with which appellant was charged; so construed, the presumption would violate due process clauses of Fourteenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution and this section by virtue of improperly shifting burden of proof to appellant.  78 H. 262, 892 P.2d 455.</P>
<P>  To protect the right to testify under Hawai`i constitution, trial courts must advise criminal defendants of their right to testify and must obtain on-the-record waiver of that right in every case in which the defendant does not testify.  79 H. 226, 900 P.2d 1293. </P>
<P>  Reversible error where jury may have reached verdict by improperly shifting burden of proof from prosecution to defense by concluding that defendant had not established defendant's claim of extreme mental or emotional distress before considering whether prosecution had disproved that defense beyond a reasonable doubt. 80 H. 172, 907 P.2d 758.</P>
<P>  Defendant received adequate notice that consecutive sentences may be imposed by sentencing court where court had that discretion by statute, and plain language of §706-668.5 informed defendant that defendant may be sentenced to consecutive sentences.  81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210.</P>
<P>  The right of an accused to a unanimous verdict in a criminal prosecution, tried before a jury in a court of this State, is guaranteed by this section and §14 of this article of the Hawaii constitution.  84 H. 1, 928 P.2d 843.</P>
<P>  When separate and distinct culpable acts are subsumed within a single count charging a sexual assault, the trial court must either (1) require the prosecution to elect the specific act upon which the prosecution is relying to establish the "conduct" element of the charged offense, or (2) give the jury a specific unanimity instruction.  84 H. 1, 928 P.2d 843.</P>
<P>  Section 704-415 does not violate due process principles; at release hearing, insanity acquittee bears burden of proving by preponderance of evidence freedom from mental illness and dangerous propensities.  84 H. 269, 933 P.2d 606.</P>
<P>  Where violation of misdemeanor offense under §712-1248(1)(d) also constituted violation of felony offense under §712-1247(1)(h), conviction of felony offense would have constituted violation of defendant's due process and equal protection rights.  86 H. 48, 947 P.2d 360.</P>
<P>  In products liability action, cumulative effect of three alleged errors by trial court did not deny defendants right to fair trial where overwhelming and substantial evidence supported jury's verdict.  86 H. 214, 948 P.2d 1055.</P>
<P>  Although appellant was not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses who had testified at a public hearing but not before the zoning board of appeals, error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  87 H. 217, 953 P.2d 1315.</P>
<P>  Director's exposure to materials outside the record constitutionally harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as director expressly declined to consider material in rendering decision.  87 H. 217, 953 P.2d 1315.</P>
<P>  A trial court must pass on a defendant’s attempted withdrawal of the prior waiver of his or her right to testify, tendered before the commencement of closing arguments, pursuant to the "liberal approach", whereas such an attempted withdrawal tendered thereafter is subject to the "manifest injustice" standard.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where defendant did not meet burden of establishing plausible and legitimate reasons for withdrawal of defendant’s prior waiver of defendant’s right to testify, defendant failed to present "fair and just reasons" for defendant’s request to exercise defendant’s right to testify in defendant’s own behalf; thus trial court did not abuse discretion by ruling that it would not reopen case.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where trial court’s denial of defendant’s post-verdict motion for a new trial -- based on defendant’s claim that defendant’s attempt to withdraw defendant’s waiver of right to testify in defendant’s own behalf should have been allowed -- was not "manifestly unjust", no abuse of discretion.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where trial court failed to correct prosecution’s erroneous interpretation of "remains unlawfully" under §708-810, defendant’s constitutional rights to due process and a unanimous jury verdict violated.  89 H. 284, 972 P.2d 287.</P>
<P>  Deprivation of property solely on basis of substituted service in adverse possession action violates due process, where, with due diligence, actual notice possible.  6 H. App. 241, 718 P.2d 1109.</P>
<P>  Does not require agency hearing before tax director issues notices of tax assessment.  6 H. App. 260, 718 P.2d 1122.</P>
<P>  In paternity action, due process not violated by exclusion of sexual access information and preclusion of cross-examination of mother regarding her earlier pregnancy.  6 H. App. 629, 736 P.2d 448.</P>
<P>  Act of state witness leaving witness stand in presence of security personnel was not so prejudicial as to deny defendant's right to fair trial; jury is presumed to adhere to court's cautionary instruction to draw no inference from event.  8 H. App. 624, 817 P.2d 130.</P>
<P>  Violated where court imposed attorney sanctions pursuant to its powers under §603-21.9 without adequate prior notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard.  9 H. App. 249, 833 P.2d 85.</P>
<P>  Because the constitutional right of allocution is one afforded "pre-sentence", manifestly, the defendant must be given the opportunity to be heard before the court imposes sentence; defendant had right of allocution before being sentenced for misdemeanor offense of driving with revoked license and for violation charge of illegal turn.  77 H. 241 (App.), 883 P.2d 663.</P>
<P>  Defendant’s constitutional and statutory right to testify in defendant’s own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow defendant’s attorney’s advice and thus refrain from testifying, and the violation was plain error; denial of the right to testify was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>
<P>  Defendant’s right to an impartial judge was violated where nature and extent of the court’s questioning of one of the complainants demonstrated that the court assumed the role of a prosecutor, thus failing to act impartially.  When the court assumes the role of a prosecutor, it violates the fundamental due process requirement that the tribunal be impartial, and such an error, by definition, is inherently prejudicial and not harmless.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>
<P>  Motions court’s order denying defendant’s pre-trial motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay affirmed, where, inter alia, motions court was correct in concluding that defendant failed to establish that defendant’s claimed inability to recollect events prior to defendant’s indictment, even with the aid of others, amounted to substantial prejudice to defendant’s right to a fair trial.  79 H. 165 (App.), 880 P.2d 217.</P>
<P>  Violated where trial court's exclusion of gun-like cigarette lighter prejudiced defendant by precluding jury from properly evaluating essential defense evidence.  79 H. 385 (App.), 903 P.2d 690.</P>
<P>  Violated where petitioner whose driver's license was administratively revoked denied right to cross-examine director's representative regarding basis for continuance of administrative hearing.  80 H. 358 (App.), 910 P.2d 129.</P>
<P>  Defendant entitled to elicit evidence of complainant's past sexual behavior, not to attack complainant's character, but to determine whether complainant was mentally defective and whether defendant knew that complainant was mentally defective.  81 H. 447 (App.), 918 P.2d 254.</P>
<P>  Where discussion that defendant was subject to mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment pursuant to §706-660.1 was conducted at bench outside of defendant's hearing, defendant was not given reasonable notice of intended application of mandatory minimum term statute.  82 H. 158 (App.), 920 P.2d 372.</P>
<P>  Section 291C-112, which prohibits the use of a vehicle "for purposes of human habitation", not unconstitutionally vague.  82 H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170.</P>
<P>  "Reasonable grounds" standard of §709-906(4) not unconstitutionally vague where standard is an objective standard requiring a trial court to independently assess facts and circumstances which responding officers had before them in determining to issue warning citations.  82 H. 381 (App.), 922 P.2d 994.</P>
<P>  Section 709-906(4) not overbroad as issuance of warning citation must be based on objective facts and circumstances, other than merely a complainant's claim, which would lead a reasonable police officer to believe recent physical abuse was inflicted on family or household member.  82 H. 381 (App.), 922 P.2d 994.</P>
<P>  Violated where claimant failed to serve employer and insurer with motion and summons; circuit court thus did not acquire personal jurisdiction over employer and insurer and judgment and garnishee summons issued pursuant to §386-91 in absence of personal jurisdiction void.  82 H. 405 (App.), 922 P.2d 1018.</P>
<P>  Procedural due process right not denied when guardian ad litem not appointed for mother where mother was provided with court-appointed attorney and, pursuant to §587-34(d), court determined mother was capable of comprehending legal significance of issues.  85 H. 119 (App.), 938 P.2d 178.</P>
<P>  Application of preponderance of the evidence standard as appropriate judicial basis for issuance of protective order under §586-5.5 does not violate right.  85 H. 197 (App.), 940 P.2d 404.</P>
<P>  Where building addition was permitted structure under zoning ordinance in existence at time subsequent land use ordinance was adopted, requiring landowner to remove addition and pay daily fines until addition was removed constituted interference with landowner's vested property rights under this clause.  86 H. 343 (App.), 949 P.2d 183.</P>
<P>  Right violated where circuit court’s instruction to jury regarding the statutory presumption created by §708-801(4) failed to further instruct jury pursuant to HRE Rule 306(a) that the presumption is merely a permissible inference of fact and that in order to apply the presumption, the jury must find that the presumed fact exists beyond a reasonable doubt.  88 H. 216 (App.), 965 P.2d 149.</P>
<P>  As no Hawaii statute governing parole requires a parolee’s parole to be automatically revoked upon the parolee’s conviction and sentence to imprisonment for a crime committed while on parole, and §353-62 appears to vest Hawaii paroling authority with discretion to revoke parole, parolee’s right violated when authority summarily revoked parole without giving parolee a final revocation hearing.  88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162.</P>
<P>  Section 852-1 not void for vagueness as:  (1) a person of ordinary intelligence would have a reasonable opportunity to know that it is unlawful to refuse or wilfully fail to move as directed by an officer; (2) person may then choose between the lawful and unlawful conduct; and (3) the statute provides sufficiently explicit standards for those who apply it.  89 H. 27 (App.), 968 P.2d 194.</P>
<P>  Under the due process clause of the Hawaii constitution, entrapment by estoppel defense may be raised against the State in criminal cases and clause would be violated if the facts established the defense.  89 H. 27 (App.), 968 P.2d 194.</P>
<P>  Section 52D-8 provides officers with a constitutionally protected property interest--the right to legal representation for acting within the scope of their duty; due process thus entitles an officer to a contested case hearing under chapter 91 before the officer can be deprived of this interest.  89 H. 221 (App.), 971 P.2d 310.</P>
<P>  Right violated where jury instruction failed to correctly  convey proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard to jury; instruction that jury must be "firmly convinced" of defendant’s guilt diminished this very high standard by which jury must abide in order to convict.  90 H. 113 (App.), 976 P.2d 427.</P>

<B><P>Equal protection.</P>
</B><P>  See also notes to U.S. Const. Amend 14.</P>
<P>  Ordinance creating mechanism through which condominium owners could convert their leasehold interests into fee simple interests was constitutional.  124 F.3d 1150.</P>
<P>  Applicable only to state action not private action.  698 F. Supp. 1496.</P>
<P>  Not violated where city ordinance providing mechanism for transfer of fee simple interest from condominium lessors to lessees did not intentionally discriminate against Native Hawaiians.  802 F. Supp. 326.</P>
<P>  Condominium lease-to-fee ordinance did not violate plaintiff's equal protection rights.  832 F. Supp. 1404.</P>
<P>  No violation, where plaintiff argued that §490:2-725 discriminated among two classes of warranty claimants, and appeared to argue that UCC arbitrarily discriminated among differing classes of defendants, insofar as it granted partial immunity to those in commercial sales without similarly limiting the liability of others potentially liable for industrial diseases.  854 F. Supp. 702.</P>
<P>  Where plaintiffs filed motion for preliminary injunction regarding Act 359 of 1993 Hawaii legislature (relating to Hawaiian sovereignty), as amended in 1994 and 1996, plaintiffs not likely to prevail on constitutional claims under Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of U.S. Constitution, article II, §1 and this section of Hawaii constitution, or Voting Rights Act with regards to native Hawaiian vote.  941 F. Supp. 1529.</P>
<P>  In view of underlying differences between cars and motorcycles, §286-81(1)(A), requiring motorcycle safety helmets, does not violate the equal protection clause.  55 H. 138, 516 P.2d 709.</P>
<P>  Requirement that a woman visitor to an all-male prison wear a brassiere is not invalid.  59 H. 346, 581 P.2d 1164.</P>
<P>  The protection of this section is not necessarily limited to that provided by the Fourteenth Amendment.  60 H. 71, 588 P.2d 394.</P>
<P>  Constitutionality of statute regulating taking of nehu upheld.  60 H. 662, 594 P.2d 130.</P>
<P>  In context of equal protection analysis, right to work does not invoke application of strict scrutiny.  60 H. 662, 594 P.2d 130.</P>
<P>  Rational basis exists for compulsory retirement age for state employees.  63 H. 501, 630 P.2d 629.</P>
<P>  No rational basis for disparate treatment of classes in establishing statute of limitations.  65 H. 26, 647 P.2d 276.</P>
<P>  Certain provisions of motor vehicle insurance law denied equal protection.  65 H. 623, 656 P.2d 736.</P>
<P>  Right to privacy does not invoke strict scrutiny; rational basis for county to require financial disclosure by "regulatory employees".  68 H. 140, 706 P.2d 814.</P>
<P>  Public policy against racial discrimination.  69 H. 238, 738 P.2d 1205.</P>
<P>  Sex is suspect category for purposes of equal protection analysis under this section; §572-1 is presumed to be unconstitutional unless defendant, as agent of State, can show that statute’s sex-based classification is justified by compelling state interests, and statute is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of applicant couples’ constitutional rights.  74 H. 530, 852 P.2d 44.</P>
<P>  Where county imposed impermissibly discriminatory tax, county must be given certain options to correct the impermissible discrimination.  81 H. 248, 915 P.2d 1349.</P>
<P>  Section 704-415 does not violate equal protection; State may place burden on insanity acquittee to prove by preponderance of evidence that acquitee should be released.  84 H. 269, 933 P.2d 606.</P>
<P>  Not violated by trial court's redaction of home street addresses and home and work telephone numbers on juror qualification forms where redaction procedure was not administered differently against other similarly situated criminal defendants having jury trials in the first circuit.  85 H. 258, 942 P.2d 522.</P>
<P>  Where violation of misdemeanor offense under §712-1248(1)(d) also constituted violation of felony offense under §712-1247(1)(h), conviction of felony offense would have constituted violation of defendant's due process and equal protection rights.  86 H. 48, 947 P.2d 360.</P>
<P>  Not violated by §431:10C-306 (pre-1997) as applied to persons ineligible for no-fault benefits.  87 H. 297, 955 P.2d 90.</P>
<P>  As chapter 671 rationally furthers legitimate state interest of assuring the provision of affordable health care to Hawaii’s citizens by requiring  participation in medical malpractice dispute resolution such that the high cost of  litigation may be avoided, plaintiff not denied equal protection of the laws.  89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496.</P>
