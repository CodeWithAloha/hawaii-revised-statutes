<P>&#9;<B>Section 2.</B>  The legislature may submit to the electorate at any general or special election the question, "Shall there be a convention to propose a revision of or amendments to the Constitution?"

<P>&#9;If a majority of the ballots cast upon such a question be in the affirmative, delegates to the convention shall be chosen at the next regular election unless the legislature shall provide for the election of delegates at a special election.</P>
<P>&#9;Notwithstanding any provision in this constitution to the contrary, other than Section 3 of Article XVI, any qualified voter of the district concerned shall be eligible to membership in the convention.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature shall provide for the number of delegates to the convention, the areas from which they shall be elected and the manner in which the convention shall convene.  The legislature shall also provide for the necessary facilities and equipment for the convention.  The convention shall have the same powers and privileges, as nearly as practicable, as provided for the convention of 1978.</P>

<P>&#9;The constitutional convention shall convene not less than five months prior to the next regularly scheduled general election.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ORGANIZATION; PROCEDURE</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;The convention shall determine its own organization and rules of procedure.  It shall be the sole judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its members and, by a two-thirds vote, may suspend or remove any member for cause.  The governor shall fill any vacancy by appointment of a qualified voter from the district concerned.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RATIFICATION; APPROPRIATIONS</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;The convention shall provide for the time and manner in which the proposed constitutional revision or amendments shall be submitted to a vote of the electorate; provided that each amendment shall be submitted in the form of a question embracing but one subject; and provided further, that each question shall have designated spaces to mark YES or NO on the amendment.</P>
<P>&#9;At least thirty days prior to the submission of any proposed revision or amendments, the convention shall make available for public inspection, a full text of the proposed amendments.  Every public library, office of the clerk of each county, and the chief election officer shall be provided such texts and shall make them available for public inspection.  The full text of any proposed revision or amendments shall also be made available for inspection at every polling place on the day of the election at which such revision or amendments are submitted.</P>
<P>&#9;The convention shall, as provided by law, be responsible for a program of voter education concerning each proposed revision or amendment to be submitted to the electorate.</P>
<P>&#9;The revision or amendments shall be effective only if approved at a general election by a majority of all the votes tallied upon the question, this majority constituting at least fifty per cent of the total vote cast at the election, or at a special election by a majority of all the votes tallied upon the question, this majority constituting at least thirty per cent of the total number of registered voters.</P>
<P>&#9;The provisions of this section shall be self-executing, but the legislature shall make the necessary appropriations and may enact legislation to facilitate their operation.
