<P>&#9;<B>Section 2.</B>  Each political subdivision shall have the power to frame and adopt a charter for its own self-government within such limits and under such procedures as may be provided by general law.  Such procedures, however, shall not require the approval of a charter by a legislative body.</P>
<P>&#9;Charter provisions with respect to a political subdivision's executive, legislative and administrative structure and organization shall be superior to statutory provisions, subject to the authority of the legislature to enact general laws allocating and reallocating powers and functions.</P>
<P>&#9;A law may qualify as a general law even though it is inapplicable to one or more counties by reason of the provisions of this section. [Am Const Con 1968 and election Nov&nbsp;5, 1968; ren and am Const Con 1978 and election Nov&nbsp;7, 1978]</P>
