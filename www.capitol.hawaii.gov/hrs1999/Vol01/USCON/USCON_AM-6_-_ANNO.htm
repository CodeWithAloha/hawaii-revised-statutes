<P>  Defendants not deprived of constitutional right to speedy trial where although the reason for the delay factor weighed in favor of the defendants, it was outweighed by the facts that defendants failed to assert their right and failed to demonstrate that they were actually prejudiced by the delay in bringing them to trial.  78 H. 54, 890 P.2d 291.</P>

<P>  Defendant has burden to establish ineffective assistance of counsel and meet two-part test; under Hawaii Constitution, defendant afforded greater protection of right to effective assistance of counsel than under U.S. Constitution.  74 H. 54, 837 P.2d 1298.</P>
<P>  No denial of effective assistance of counsel where counsel waived defendant's presence at conference settling jury instructions, withdrew insanity defense, and failed to object to examiner's testimony.  74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374.</P>
<P>  Where petitioner’s convictions on counts I (attempted first degree murder), II (second degree murder), and III (attempted second degree murder) violated §701-109(1)(c)’s clear prohibition against inconsistent factual findings, the failure to raise this issue, both at trial and on appeal, resulted in withdrawal of not only a potentially meritorious defense, but a defense that would have altered the outcome.  74 H. 442, 848 P.2d 966.</P>
<P>  Post-conviction ineffective assistance of counsel Rule 40 petition not prejudiced where defendant alleges facts that, if proven, would entitle defendant to relief and claim is not patently frivolous and without trace of support in the record.  75 H. 419, 864 P.2d 583.</P>
<P>  Trial counsel’s alleged errors did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where defendant argued, inter alia, that trial counsel should have obtained expert analysis of white powder defendant provided to undercover police officer to determine how much "pure" cocaine it contained; rejection of defendant’s claim that trial counsel’s failure to interview and subpoena defendant’s girlfriend amounted to ineffective assistance was without prejudice to a subsequent HRPP rule 40 petition.  77 H. 72, 881 P.2d 1218.</P>
<P>  A proceeding to review revocation of a driver's license under §286-259 is a civil administrative proceeding, not a criminal proceeding for DUI; thus, accused's right to assistance of counsel inapplicable to administrative driver's license revocation hearing.  80 H. 197, 908 P.2d 545.</P>
<P>  Knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of right to counsel where, inter alia, defendant persistently refused legal assistance despite court's repeated invitation and amply demonstrated capacity to proceed pro se.  81 H. 198, 915 P.2d 672.</P>

<P>  No ineffective assistance where defense counsel's opening statement reflected an accurate understanding of defendant's and victim's rendition at trial of events surrounding incident in question.  83 H. 289, 926 P.2d 194.</P>
<P>  Defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived rights to counsel and to remain silent and voluntarily gave statement to police where defendant was calm and lucid during taped interview, indicated medication did not affect thinking or judgment, never expressed desire to terminate interview, and was particularly sophisticated with respect to criminal process and rights of accused.  83 H. 308, 926 P.2d 599.</P>
<P>  Judicial determination of probable cause proceeding is not a "critical stage" in criminal proceedings such that Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches automatically.  83 H. 443, 927 P.2d 844.</P>
<P>  Where attorney-client privilege was not applicable to communications because they were not "confidential" but "voluntarily disclosed" in known presence of third party who was neither codefendant nor representative of the client or of the lawyer and in a place accessible to the general public, right to effective assistance not violated.  84 H. 229, 933 P.2d 66.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance by counsel's failure to obtain witnesses' testimony on Japanese organized crime where counsel could not have known trial court would refuse to qualify one as expert, other witness fell ill, and testimony would not have been enough to support duress defense.  85 H. 462, 946 P.2d 32.</P>
<P>  Where defendant could have challenged the validity of the search warrant if given a range of dates of the observations by prosecution’s confidential informant and defendant’s attorney could file the appropriate pre-trial motions and prepare for trial without the exact dates, right to effective assistance of counsel not violated by defendant not knowing the exact dates of the observations.  88 H. 396, 967 P.2d 228.</P>
<P>  Appellant has burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel; burden, how met.  1 H. App. 255, 617 P.2d 1235; 1 H. App. 268, 618 P.2d 315.</P>
<P>  Counsel's failure to object to prosecutor's questions or to move for mistrial or to strike as constituting ineffective assistance of counsel.  1 H. App. 536, 621 P.2d 986.</P>
<P>  No per se right on the part of an indigent defendant to change counsel in middle of trial.  2 H. App. 462, 634 P.2d 421.</P>
<P>  Dismissal of indictment not appropriate remedy for violation absent showing of prejudice or substantial threat thereof.  3 H. App. 107, 643 P.2d 807.</P>
<P>  Not violated where imprisonment authorized but not imposed.  3 H. App. 673, 657 P.2d 1062.</P>
<P>  Right to effective assistance of counsel was violated by defense counsel's prior and concurrent representation of prosecution witnesses in other matters.  4 H. App. 327, 666 P.2d 612.</P>
<P>  Infringement of right presumed prejudicial and State must rebut presumption and prove error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  4 H. App. 614, 672 P.2d 1036.</P>
<P>  No right to counsel at post-arrest photographic display.  5 H. App. 127, 681 P.2d 573.</P>
<P>  Standard for effective assistance of appellate counsel; right not violated.  6 H. App. 331, 720 P.2d 1015.</P>
<P>  No right to hybrid representation.  8 H. App. 330, 802 P.2d 482.</P>
<P>  Whether person arrested on basis of indictment and advised of and waived right to counsel under Miranda v. Arizona but not advised of right under Sixth Amendment and article I, §14 of Hawaii constitution, has also knowingly and intelligently waived right under the two provisions, discussed.  9 H. App. 447, 845 P.2d 1194.</P>
<P>  The court’s assumption of defense counsel’s role by persuading defendant to relinquish defendant’s right to testify was an interference with the attorney-client relationship protected by Sixth Amendment and article I, §14 of Hawai`i constitution; the intervention by the court constituted plain error; the error was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>
<P>  Absent valid waiver of right, use of prior uncounseled felony convictions to enhance prison sentence violated defendant's right to counsel.  81 H. 421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel's failure to request trial continuance when police officer was unavailable to testify at trial did not result in prejudice to defendant.  82 H. 394 (App.), 922 P.2d 1007.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance where, inter alia, defendant's counsel adequately prepared for trial, did not fail to offer motion to sever trials, and no evidence that fact that defendant's counsel was not lead counsel was prejudicial to defendant's entrapment defense.  82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d 916.</P>
<P>  No ineffective assistance where there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant as accomplice to second degree murder such that motion for judgment of acquittal would not have succeeded.  84 H. 112 (App.), 929 P.2d 1362.</P>
<P>  Cited:  56 H. 378, 537 P.2d 1187.</P>

<B><P>Impartial jury.</P>

<P>  Excusal of college students from venire did not violate right to jury fairly representing cross-section of community since college students did not qualify as cognizable group.  965 F.2d 781.</P>
<P>  Though prosecutor's remarks were of questionable relevance and conveyed repugnant images, reversal justified only where alleged prosecutorial misconduct materially affects verdict or deprives defendant of fair trial.  1 F.3d 1523.</P>
<P>  Habeas corpus granted due to jury misconduct.  677 F. Supp. 1061.</P>
<P>  Scope of voir dire of prospective jurors in case of extensive pretrial publicity.  55 H. 640, 526 P.2d 94.</P>

<P>  Trial court's supplemental instruction to deadlocked jury that it must unanimously decide that it was unable to reach verdict was prejudicial.  72 H. 327, 817 P.2d 1054.</P>
<P>  Trial court must insure that defendant's right to fair trial is not compromised and at the least prevent or reduce prejudicial pretrial publicity; order imposing restrictions on extrajudicial statements of trial participants was impermissible.  73 H. 499, 835 P.2d 637.</P>
<P>  Circuit court did not commit an abuse of discretion in granting defendant’s motion for new trial; circuit court’s conclusions of law that possible juror misconduct at voir dire and juror misconduct during deliberations deprived defendant of a trial by twelve fair and impartial jurors not clearly erroneous.  76 H. 172, 873 P.2d 51.</P>
<P>  Newscast concerning appellants and their alleged involvement in a burglary other than those charged and prospective juror’s account of the newscast and the effect it had on prospective juror that was given in presence of jury panel, discussed as "outside influences".  78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80.</P>
<P>  Not violated by empaneling of anonymous jury where there was strong reason to believe jury needed protection and trial court took reasonable steps to minimize any prejudicial effect on defendant and ensure that defendant's fundamental rights were protected.  83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Purpose of §612-18(c) is to uphold a criminal defendant's constitutional guarantees of a presumption of innocence and an impartial jury.  83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</P>
<P>  Defendant’s right not violated by having husband and wife serve on same jury; both expressly stated during voir dire that they would each make their own decisions and would not automatically go along with the other person.  88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227.</P>
<P>  Failure to inquire into circumstances of statement overheard by juror, and reliance on juror's own determination of ability to remain impartial while unaware of influences is reversible error.  2 H. App. 643, 639 P.2d 413.</P>
<P>  Not violated by bailiff's statement to jury foreperson that jurors should all agree with verdict if polled.  6 H. App. 320, 721 P.2d 718.</P>
<P>  Where trial court found statements of jurors on voir dire credible, statements were sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that defendant was not denied an impartial jury.  85 H. 49 (App.), 936 P.2d 1297.</P>
<P>  Where State failed to rebut presumption of prejudice to defendant resulting from juror’s improper investigation of details concerning defendant’s welfare status, court properly granted motion for new trial.  89 H. 215 (App.), 971 P.2d 304.</P>

<B><P>Compulsory process.</P>
</B><P>  District court erred in excluding defense expert witness as sanction for asserted violation of discovery rule where no discovery violation occurred.  937 F.2d 1422.</P>
<P>  A sentencing increase based on defendant's false testimony does not unconstitutionally burden defendant's right to testify.  1 F.3d 1523; 35 F.3d 1275.</P>
<P>  Where defendant contended that pursuant to constitutional right to testify, district court was required to permit defendant to explain to jury that defendant behaved in manner that defendant did because defendant was acting under duress, whether or not defendant had demonstrated prima facie evidence of duress, since proposed testimony pertained to a defense that was not relevant as a matter of law, the district court did not err in excluding the evidence during the trial.  102 F.3d 994.</P>
<P>  Defendant only afforded right to compel attendance and testimony of witnesses who can give relevant and beneficial testimony for defense.  64 H. 217, 638 P.2d 324; 67 H. 59, 677 P.2d 465.</P>
<P>  A trial court must pass on a defendant’s attempted withdrawal of the prior waiver of his or her right to testify, tendered before the commencement of closing arguments, pursuant to the "liberal approach", whereas such an attempted withdrawal tendered thereafter is subject to the "manifest injustice" standard.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where defendant did not meet burden of establishing plausible and legitimate reasons for withdrawal of defendant’s prior waiver of defendant’s right to testify, defendant failed to present "fair and just reasons" for defendant’s request to exercise defendant’s right to testify in defendant’s own behalf; thus trial court did not abuse discretion by ruling that it would not reopen case.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Where trial court’s denial of defendant’s post-verdict motion for a new trial -- based on defendant’s claim that defendant’s attempt to withdraw defendant’s waiver of right to testify in defendant’s own behalf should have been allowed -- was not "manifestly unjust", no abuse of discretion.  88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</P>
<P>  Refusal of court to permit defendant at an identification suppression hearing to examine the identification witness was not violative of constitutional rights.  1 H. App. 335, 619 P.2d 1078.</P>
<P>  Constitutional right to present character evidence no greater than right under Hawaii Rules of Evidence.  5 H. App. 251, 687 P.2d 554.</P>
<P>  Defendant’s constitutional and statutory right to testify in defendant’s own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow defendant’s attorney’s advice and thus refrain from testifying, and the violation was plain error; denial of the right to testify was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</P>

<B><P>Appeal.</P>
</B><P>  Seven-day failure to comply with time requirements for filing criminal appeal does not preclude right to appeal.  2 H. App. 606, 638 P.2d 338.</P>

<B><P>Right to be informed.</P>
</B><P>  Indictment that charged defendant with "murder-for-hire" may not have given defendant notice that defendant must be prepared to meet a murder charge based on accomplice liability.  807 F.2d 805.</P>
<P>  Not violated where burglary indictment alleged all elements of the crime and record indicated the specific crime intended to be committed, though specific crime not alleged.  66 H. 312, 660 P.2d 39.</P>
<P>  Indictment charging general intent crime need not contain a particularized allegation of general intent.  66 H. 650, 672 P.2d 554.</P>
<P>  Not violated where indictment alleged all elements of the crime and record indicated the specific crime intended to be committed, though specific crime not alleged.  67 H. 105, 678 P.2d 1078.</P>
<P>  Not violated though indictment stated in disjunctive, where it tracked definition of crime and record indicated specific crime committed.  67 H. 119, 680 P.2d 250.</P>
<P>  Accomplice instruction improper where each defendant was charged separately and charges did not inform them of circumstances in which they acted as accomplices.  72 H. 278, 815 P.2d 428.</P>
<P>  Section 485-21 provides an essential element of offense charged, when a defendant is charged with a criminal violation of Uniform Securities Act; counts of indictment, which cited to §485-21, were insufficient, as counts did not include essential elements of offenses charged. 78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70.</P>
<P>  Violated where minutes before trial was to commence, complaint against defendant amended from driving while license suspended to driving without a license.  81 H. 76 (App.), 912 P.2d 573.</P>
