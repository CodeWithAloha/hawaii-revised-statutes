<P>&#9;The director shall have the authority to adopt rules as heretofore exercised by the civil service commission.  Whenever consistent with economic and efficient administration, the director may delegate any of the duties imposed upon the director by chapter 76 or chapter 77 to the department heads, or any of them, in accordance with standards and procedures issued by the director.  The director shall institute and maintain a system of inspection to determine that the personnel laws are applied and administered by the departments in a manner consistent with the purposes and provisions of the civil service law.  Whenever an inspection indicates failure on the part of a department to comply with established policies, rules, and standards, the director shall take any action that may be appropriate, including suspension or revocation of any delegation of the director's authority.</P>
<P>&#9;The department shall administer the state human resources program, including human resources development and training, and central human resources services such as recruitment, examination, position classification, and pay administration for all departments.</P>
<P>&#9;There shall be within the department of human resources development a commission to be known as the civil service commission which shall sit as an appellate body on matters within the jurisdiction of the department of human resources development.  The commission shall consist of seven members, one from each county and three at large.  At least one member of the commission shall be selected from among persons employed in private industry in skilled or unskilled laboring positions as distinguished from executive or professional positions.  The functions, duties, and powers of the commission with respect to appeals shall be as heretofore provided by law for the civil service commission and for the loyalty board existing immediately prior to November&nbsp;25, 1959.</P>
<P>&#9;The functions and authority heretofore exercised by the department of civil service and loyalty board as heretofore constituted are transferred to the department of human resources development established by this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;Nothing in this section shall be construed as in any manner affecting the civil service laws applicable to the several counties which shall remain the same as if this chapter had not been enacted.
