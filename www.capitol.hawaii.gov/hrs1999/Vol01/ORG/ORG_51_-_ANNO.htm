<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>  The first paragraph of this § was taken, by the commission which drafted this act, from the Hawaiian Const. of 1894 (§69), and the second paragraph was added by Congress, from the Federal Const. (Art. 1, §7).  The latter giving twelve days, including Sundays, in which to return a bill, probably controls the former, and apparently this was recognized by the legislature in the case of L. 1911, c. 143.  In several instances bills have been signed by the governor after the adjournment of the legislature but within ten days after their passage.  Referred to in 16 H. 245.</P>
