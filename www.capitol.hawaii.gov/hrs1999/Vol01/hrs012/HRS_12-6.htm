<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§12-6  Nomination papers:  time for filing; fees.</B>  (a)  Nomination papers shall be filed as follows:  for members of Congress, state, and county offices, and the board of trustees of the office of Hawaiian affairs, with the chief election officer, or clerk in case of county offices, not later than 4:30 p.m. on the sixtieth calendar day prior to the primary, special primary, or special election provided that if such day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday then not later than 4:30 p.m. on the first working day immediately preceding.  A state candidate from the counties of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai may file the declaration of candidacy with the respective clerk.  The clerk shall transmit to the office of the chief election officer the state candidate's declaration of candidacy without delay.  However, if a special primary or special election is to be held by a county and the county charter requires that the council shall issue a proclamation calling for the election to be held within a specified period of time, and if that requirement would not allow the filing of nomination papers with the appropriate office by the sixtieth calendar day prior to the day for holding the special primary or special election, the council shall establish the deadline for the filing of nomination papers in the proclamation calling for the election.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  There shall be deposited with each nomination paper a filing fee on account of the expenses attending the holding of the primary, special primary, or special election which shall be paid into the treasury of the State, or county, as the case may be, as a realization:</P><DIR>
