The original warrant voucher shall have indorsed thereon the approval of the officer in whose department the liability or expense has been incurred, and the appropriation to which it is chargeable; and further, each original bill shall be specially certified to by the subordinate officer of the State directly incurring the liability or expense that all the materials, supplies, and incidentals have been received in good order and condition, unless the bill is for an advance payment or a deposit to be paid as specified in the department's purchase order, in which case the certification of the original bill by the subordinate officer is not required.  Any advance payment made under this section must conform to the common business practice for making such payment as determined by the comptroller.
