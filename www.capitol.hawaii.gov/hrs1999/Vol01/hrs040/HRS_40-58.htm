The comptroller or the chief financial officers of the University of Hawaii and the department of education may prescribe the form for an assignment, and may approve the assignment within a reasonable time period if, in their respective discretion, the rights or obligations of the State, the University of Hawaii, or the department of education under any contract or other undertaking or under any law, rule, or order by a competent authority will not be prejudiced thereby.
