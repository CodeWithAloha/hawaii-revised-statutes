The notice shall include the name, social security number, address, and birthdate of the voter and must be signed by the voter with the name under which the voter is registered to vote.  Upon receipt of that notice containing the information required by this section, the chief election officer shall notify the group or individual to whom the petition was issued and the signature of the individual shall not be counted.
