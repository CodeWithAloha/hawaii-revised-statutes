The following rules shall determine residency for election purposes only:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The residence of a person is that place in which the person's habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever the person is absent, the person has the intention to return;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A person does not gain residence in any precinct into which the person comes without the present intention of establishing the person's permanent dwelling place within such precinct;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If a person resides with the person's family in one place, and does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence; but any person having a family, who establishes the person's dwelling place other than with the person's family, with the intention of remaining there shall be considered a resident where the person has established such dwelling place;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The mere intention to acquire a new residence without physical presence at such place, does not establish residency, neither does mere physical presence without the concurrent present intention to establish such place as the person's residence;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;A person does not gain or lose a residence solely by reason of the person's presence or absence while employed in the service of the United States or of this State, or while a student of an institution of learning, or while kept in an institution or asylum, or while confined in a prison;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;No member of the armed forces of the United States, the member's spouse or the member's dependent is a resident of this State solely by reason of being stationed in the State;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;A person loses the person's residence in this State if the person votes in an election held in another state by absentee ballot or in person.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In case of question, final determination of residence shall be made by the clerk, subject to appeal to the board of registration under part III of this chapter. [L 1970, c 26, pt of §2; am L 1975, c 36, §1(1); am L 1977, c 189, §1(1); gen ch 1985]</P>
