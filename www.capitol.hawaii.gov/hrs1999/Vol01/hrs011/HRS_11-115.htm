<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§11-115  Arrangement of names on the ballot.</B>  The names of the candidates shall be placed upon the ballot for their respective offices in alphabetical order except as provided in section 11-118 and the limitations of the voting system in use, and except for the case of the candidates for vice president and lieutenant governor in the general election whose names shall be placed immediately below the name of the candidate for president or governor of the same political party.</P>
<P>&#9;In elections using the paper ballot or electronic voting systems where the names of the candidates are printed and the voter records the voter's vote on the face of the ballot, the following format shall be used:  A horizontal line shall be ruled between each candidate's name and the next name, except between the names of presidential and vice presidential candidates and candidates for governor and lieutenant governor of the same political party in the general election.  In such case the horizontal line will follow the name of the candidates for vice president and lieutenant governor of the same political party, thereby grouping the candidates for president and vice president and governor and lieutenant governor of the same political party within the same pair of horizontal lines.  Immediately after all the names, on the right side of the ballot, two vertical lines shall be ruled, so that in conjunction with the horizontal lines, a box shall be formed opposite each name and its equivalent, if any.  In case of the candidates for president and vice president and governor and lieutenant governor of the same political party, only one box shall be formed opposite their set of names.  The boxes shall be of sufficient size to give ample room in which to designate the choice of the voter in the manner prescribed for the voting system in use.  All of the names upon a ballot shall be placed at a uniform distance from the left edge and close thereto, and shall be of uniform size and print subject to section 11-119.
