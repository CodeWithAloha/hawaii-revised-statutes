<P>&#9;"Established date of operation" means the date on which the original farming operation first commenced operation.  If the physical facilities of the farming operation are subsequently expanded or new technology adopted, the established date of operation for each change shall be the same as the established date of operation for the original operation, provided that this does not violate existing state law or county ordinances.</P>
<P>&#9;"Farming operation" means a commercial agricultural or aquacultural facility or pursuit conducted, in whole or in part, including the care and production of livestock and livestock products, poultry and poultry products, and apiary, horticultural, or floricultural products; the planting, cultivating, and harvesting and processing of crops; and the farming or ranching of any plant or animal species in a controlled salt, brackish, or freshwater environment.  "Farming operation" also includes, but shall not be limited to, marketed produce at roadside stands or farm markets; noises, odors, dust, and fumes emanating from a commercial agricultural or an aquacultural facility or pursuit; operation of machinery and irrigation pumps; ground and aerial seeding and spraying; the application of chemical fertilizers, conditioners, insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides; and the employment and use of labor.  A farming operation that conducts processing operations or salt, brackish, or freshwater aquaculture operations on land that is zoned for industrial, commercial, or other nonagricultural use shall not, by reason of that zoning, fall beyond the scope of this definition; provided that those processing operations form an integral part of operations that otherwise meet the requirements of this definition.</P>
<P>&#9;"Nuisance" means any interference with reasonable use and enjoyment of land, including but not limited to smoke, odors, dust, noise, or vibration; provided that nothing in this chapter shall in any way restrict or impede the authority of the State to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.  "Nuisance" as used in this chapter includes all claims that meet the requirements of this definition regardless of whether a complainant designates such claims as brought in nuisance, negligence, trespass, or any other area of law or equity; provided that nuisance as used in this chapter does not include an alleged nuisance that involves water pollution or flooding.
