<P>&#9;<B>§195D-1  Findings and declaration of necessity.</B>  Since the discovery and settlement of the Hawaiian Islands by humans, many species of aquatic life, wildlife, and land plants that occurred naturally only in Hawaii have become extinct and many are threatened with extinction, primarily because of increased human use of the land and disturbance to native ecosystems.</P>
<P>&#9;All indigenous species of aquatic life, wildlife, and land plants are integral parts of Hawaii's native ecosystems and comprise the living heritage of Hawaii, for they represent a natural resource of scientific, cultural, educational, environmental, and economic value to future generations of Hawaii's people.</P>
<P>&#9;To insure the continued perpetuation of indigenous aquatic life, wildlife, and land plants, and their habitats for human enjoyment, for scientific purposes, and as members of ecosystems, it is necessary that the State take positive actions to enhance their prospects for survival. [L 1975, c 65, pt of §1; am L 1983, c 111, §2; gen ch 1993]</P>
