<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§171-99  Continuation of rights under existing homestead leases, certificates of occupation, right of purchase leases and cash freehold agreements.</B>  (a)  Issuance of land patents to occupier or lessee of homestead lands.  A fee simple patent shall be issued to every existing occupier under a certificate of occupation issued heretofore, and to every lessee under a nine hundred and ninety-nine year homestead lease issued heretofore, of public lands, where the lands have been improved under the certificate or lease, or have been used as a place of residence by the occupier or lessee for an aggregate continuous period of not less than ten years upon payment to the board of land and natural resources of a fair market price, disregarding the value of the improvements made by the occupier or lessee, which price shall be determined by appraisal as provided for in this chapter; provided that the board may exclude from such patents areas required as roadways to other lots.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Issuance of patent, lessee of right of purchase lease.  The lessee of any existing right of purchase lease shall, at such time and under such conditions as are contained in the lease, be entitled to a land patent from the board conveying to the lessee a fee simple title to the land described in the lessee's lease upon the payment of the fair market price of the land as determined by appraisal as provided for in this chapter, provided the lessee has reduced to cultivation twenty-five per cent of the premises and has resided thereon not less than two years and has substantially performed all other conditions of the lessee's lease.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Cash freeholds, agreement, patent, conditions.  At the end of three years from the date of the payment of the first installment, the holder of a freehold agreement is entitled to a land patent for the premises described therein, if the following conditions, in addition to those set forth herein, have been substantially performed:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Payment of the balance of the purchase price in equal installments, in one, two, and three years respectively, from the date of the freehold agreement with interest annually at the rate of four per cent; provided that the freeholder may pay the installment before it is due, and thereby stop the corresponding interest;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Cultivation of not less than twenty-five per cent of the area of the premises, and the planting and care of not less than an average of ten timber, shade or fruit trees per acre, if agricultural land, at any one time before the end of the third year, or fencing in the same if pastoral land within such time; provided that if the premises are classed as pastoral-agricultural land, the foregoing alternative conditions shall apply respectively to the two kinds of land;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Maintenance by the freeholder of the freeholder's home on the premises from the end of the first to the end of the third year;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Conditions for the prevention of waste, the planting of trees or the protection of trees growing or to be planted on the premises, or for the destruction of vegetable pests that may be on such premises or the prevention of the future introduction of such pests thereon;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Payment of all taxes that may be due on account of the premises.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;The holder of a freehold agreement shall allow the land agents to enter and examine the premises at all reasonable times to see that the conditions are being performed.  The holder shall not assign or sublet, conditionally or otherwise, the holder's interest or any part thereof, under the freehold agreement, without the written consent of the board indorsed on the agreement; and provided further that freeholders having the whole interest in a freehold agreement may at any time when all the conditions thereof to be performed by the freeholder up to such time shall have been substantially performed, surrender to the government the interest by delivery of the freehold agreement to the land agent with the intention to surrender the same clearly indorsed thereon, and signed by them and duly attested.  The surrender shall release the freeholders from all further duty or performance of the conditions of the instrument surrendered.  But no such surrender shall be permitted if any freeholders are under the age of eighteen years unless the minors are represented by statutory guardians; and provided further that any freeholder over the age of eighteen may assign the freeholder's interest to the freeholder's cotenants.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Right of purchase lease; termination, forfeiture, or surrender.  Upon the termination of a right of purchase lease by lapse of time, or upon the forfeiture or surrender of the lease or a freehold agreement, the board may in its discretion and within the limit of its authority open the premises or any part thereof for disposition in the manner or for such uses as provided in this chapter.  Before the disposition the fair market value thereof shall be established by appraisal.  The value attributable to the improvements in the appraisal shall be paid to the surrendering lessees or freeholders, upon resale of the premises, and the director of finance shall pay the amount of the valuation upon the requisition of the board out of such funds.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Interests, descent; certificate of occupation or homestead lease.  In case of the death of any occupier or lessee under an existing certificate of occupation or existing homestead lease, all the interest of the occupier or lessee, any conveyance, devise, or bequest to the contrary notwithstanding, in land held by the decedent by virtue of such certificate of occupation or homestead lease shall vest in the relations of the decedent as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;In the widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If there is no widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary, then in the children;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If there are no children, then in the widows, widowers, or reciprocal beneficiaries of the children;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;If there are no such widows, widowers, or reciprocal beneficiaries, then in the grandchildren;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;If there are no grandchildren, then in the parents or surviving parent;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;If there are no parents or surviving parent, then in the sisters and brothers;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;If there are no sisters and brothers, then in the widowers, widows, or reciprocal beneficiaries of the sisters and brothers;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;If there are no such widowers, widows, or reciprocal beneficiaries, then in the nieces and nephews;</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;If there are no nieces or nephews, then in the widowers, widows, or reciprocal beneficiaries of the nieces and nephews;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)&#9;If there are no such widowers, widows, or reciprocal beneficiaries, then in the grandchildren of the sisters and brothers;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)&#9;If there are no grandchildren of any sister or brother, then in the State.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;All the successors, except the State, shall be subject to the performance of the unperformed conditions of the certificate of occupation, or the homestead lease, in like manner as the decedent would have been subject to the performance if the decedent had continued alive; provided that if a widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary, in whom the interest shall have vested, shall thereafter marry again and decease leaving a widower, widow, or reciprocal beneficiary and a child or children of the first marriage surviving, the interest of the deceased shall vest in such child or children; and provided further that in case two or more persons succeed together to the interest of any occupier or lessee, according to the foregoing provisions, they shall hold the same by joint tenancy so long as two or more shall survive, but upon the death of the last survivor, the estate shall descend as provided above.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Option of cotenant to compel others to buy or sell.  In case two or more persons become cotenants under any existing right of purchase lease, certificate of occupation, or homestead lease by inheritance or otherwise, any one or more of such persons less than the whole number may file in the office of the land agent an offer to the remainder of the persons to buy their interest in the premises or to sell them their own interest therein at a stated price according to the proportion of the respective interest in question, and may deposit with the land agent the amount of the offered price in money, with a fee of $10.  The land agent shall thereupon notify the persons to whom the offer is made of the nature of the offer and order them to file with the land agent their answer within sixty days whether they will buy or sell according to the offer.  If the persons to whom the offer is made file with the land agent within sixty days of the time of their receiving the notification, their answer stating that they will sell their interest according to the terms of the offer, the land agent shall indorse the fact of the sale with the amount of the consideration on the lease and pay to such persons the amount of the consideration deposited with the land agent according to their individual interest; and the interest of such persons shall thereupon vest in the persons making the offer.  The fact of the transfer shall be properly recorded in the official records of the land agent and indorsed upon the lease held by the lessee.</P>
<P>&#9;If, however, the persons to whom the offer is made fail to answer within sixty days from the time of their being notified of the offer or within sixty days from the time the notice of the offer mailed to their last known place or places of abode, or shall answer within sixty days that they will buy the interest of the persons making the offer on the terms offered, but fail within sixty days after the notification to deposit the amount representing the value of the interest according to the terms offered, their interest shall vest in the persons making the offer and the amount of the consideration shall be paid by the land agent of them individually or their respective representatives upon application.  In such case the fact of the transfer shall be recorded and indorsed as above provided.</P>
<P>&#9;In the event that any funds held by the land agent hereunder may not be paid to the persons to whom properly payable, because of the inability of the land agent to locate such persons, the funds shall, after the expiration of one year, be deposited in the department of budget and finance of the State and there abide the claim of any person thereto lawfully entitled; provided that no claim to the funds shall be allowed unless the claim is made within five years after the deposit.  Payment of any claim duly filed may be made if the department of budget and finance and the board concur in finding the claim valid and proper, but if the claimant fails to obtain concurrency of the department of budget and finance and the board within sixty days of the filing of the claimant's claim, the claimant may present a petition to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit in that behalf, notice whereof shall be given to the attorney general, who may appear and defend on behalf of the State, and if the court renders a judgment in favor of the claimant, the department of budget and finance shall pay the amount due without interest.</P>
<P>&#9;But if the persons to whom the offer is made shall, within sixty days from the time of the notification, make answer to the land agent that they will buy the interest of the offering parties and shall deposit within sixty days with the land agent the amount required for the purpose according to the terms of the offer, the land agent shall indorse and record the fact of the sale as above provided, and pay to the offering parties the amount according to their individual interest; and the interest of the offering parties shall thereupon vest in the answering parties.  In such case the consideration money deposited by the offering parties shall be returned to them.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  Forfeiture; existing certificate of occupation or homestead lease.  The violation of any of the conditions of any existing certificate of occupation or homestead lease shall be sufficient cause for the board upon failure of the occupier or lessee within a reasonable period of time to remedy the default after notice thereof in the manner provided in section 171-20 to take possession of the demised premises without demand or previous entry, with or without legal process, and thereby, subject to section 171-21, terminate the estate created.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  Forfeiture; cash freeholds.  In the case of default in the payment of any of the installments due on any cash freehold agreement for thirty days after the same are due, or failure of performance of any other conditions, the board may take possession of the premises, upon failure of the freeholder within a reasonable period of time to remedy the default after notice thereof in the manner provided in section 171-20 without demand or previous entry, with or without legal process, and thereby subject to section 171-21, terminate the estate created.
