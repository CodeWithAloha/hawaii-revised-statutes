The notice shall apprise the owner of the identity and location of the property abandoned or seized and of the intent of the department to sell, donate, or otherwise dispose of the property.

<P>&#9;(f)  The requirement of public notice and public auction shall not apply when the value of the property abandoned or seized is less than $100.
