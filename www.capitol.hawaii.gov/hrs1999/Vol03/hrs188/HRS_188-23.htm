The department may issue permits for the use of electrofishing devices and explosives consistent with other legal requirements.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  It is unlawful to deposit in, permit to pass into, or place where it can pass into the state waters for the purpose of taking aquatic life any of the following:</P><DIR>

<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Any petroleum, coal or oil tar, lampblack, aniline, asphalt, bitumen, or residuary product of petroleum or carbonaceous material or substance;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Hypochlorous acid or any of its salts, including bleaches commonly sold under various trade names, such as Clorox and Purex, and bleaching powders;</P>

<P>&#9;The department may issue permits to allow the possession of stated amounts of these substances poisonous to aquatic life if the department deems the amount in possession is for legitimate purposes or in quantities too small to harm aquatic life.</P>
<P>&#9;The possession of these substances without a permit by any person on or near the water where fish can be taken, or aboard any fishing vessel or boat is prima facie evidence of a violation of this section.</P>
<P>&#9;The department may revoke any permit for any infraction of the terms and conditions of the permit.  Any person whose permit has been revoked shall not be eligible to apply for another permit until the expiration of one year from the date of revocation.</P>
<P>&#9;Nothing in this section shall be held or construed to be an amendment of the rules of the department of transportation. [L 1888, c 30, §1; RL 1925, §761; am L 1925, c 41, §2; RL 1935, §366; RL 1945, §1221; RL 1955, §21-54; HRS §188-23; am L 1981, c 85, §33; am L 1982, c 147, §9]</P>
