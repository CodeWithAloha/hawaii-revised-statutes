<P>  Complaint failed to adequately inform defendant of nature and cause of subsection (a) charge and failed to ensure that district court had before it all facts necessary to find probable cause on the charge.  78 H. 66, 890 P.2d 303.</P>
<P>  Where no evidence was presented that any "dangerous instrument" other than a firearm was involved, which established an element of the underlying felony under §707-716(1)(d), paragraph (a) did not apply.  83 H. 229, 925 P.2d 797.</P>
<P>  The felony underlying a subsection (a) offense is an included offense of the subsection (a) offense; thus pursuant to §701-109(1)(a), defendant should not have been convicted of both the subsection (a) offense and the underlying second degree murder offense.  87 H. 1, 950 P.2d 1201.</P>
<P>  The offense of use of a firearm in the commission of second degree murder in violation of subsection (a) is not an included offense of second degree murder in violation of §707-701.5(1).  87 H. 1, 950 P.2d 1201.</P>
