<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§128-18  Immunities; rights.</B>  Neither the State nor any political subdivision, nor, except in cases of wilful misconduct, the persons engaged in civil defense functions pursuant to this chapter (including volunteers whose services are accepted by any authorized person), shall be liable for the death of or injury to persons, or for damage to property, as a result of any act or omission in the course of the employment or duties, and no act or omission shall be imputed to the owner of any vehicle by reason of the owner's ownership thereof; provided that nothing herein shall preclude recovery by any person for injury or damage sustained from the operation of any vehicle which may be insured under section 41D-8 to the extent of the insurance, and unless specifically provided, insurance effected under section 41D-8 shall not include coverage of such risk during a civil defense emergency period.  The governor may insure vehicles owned by the State or in the custody and use of the civil defense agency, but insurance effected under section 41D-8 on vehicles used for purposes other than civil defense need not necessarily include coverage of the insured vehicle against the risk incurred or which would be incurred under this chapter as a result of the use of the insured vehicle for civil defense.
