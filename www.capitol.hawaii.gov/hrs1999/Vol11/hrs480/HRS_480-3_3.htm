As used in this section, an endless chain scheme means any scheme for the disposal or distribution of property whereby a participant pays a valuable consideration for the chance to receive compensation for introducing one or more additional persons into participation in the scheme, or for the chance to receive compensation when a person introduced by the participant introduces a new participant.  Compensation, as used in this section, does not mean or include payments based upon sales made to persons who are not participants in the scheme and who are not purchasing in order to participate in the scheme.
