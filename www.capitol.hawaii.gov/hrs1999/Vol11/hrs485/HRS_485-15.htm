Pending the hearing the commissioner may order the suspension of the dealer's, investment adviser's, salesperson's, or investment adviser representative's registration; provided the order states the cause for the suspension.</P>
<P>&#9;Until the entry of a final order the suspension of the dealer's or investment adviser's registration, though binding upon the persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be published, unless it appears that the order of suspension has been violated after notice.</P>
<P>&#9;In the event the commissioner determines to refuse or revoke a registration as hereinabove provided, the commissioner shall enter a final order herein with the commissioner's findings on the register of dealers, investment advisers, salespersons, and investment adviser representatives; and suspension or revocation of the registration of a dealer or investment adviser shall also suspend or revoke the registration of all the dealer's or investment adviser's salespersons or investment adviser representatives.</P>
<P>&#9;It shall be sufficient cause for refusal or cancellation of registration in case of a partnership or corporation or any unincorporated association, if any member of a partnership or any officer or director of the corporation or association has been guilty of any act or omission which would be cause for refusing or revoking the registration of an individual dealer, investment adviser, salesperson, or investment adviser representative.
