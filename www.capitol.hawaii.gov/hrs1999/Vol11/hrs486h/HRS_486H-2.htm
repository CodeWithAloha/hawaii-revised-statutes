The action may be brought without regard to the amount in controversy.  If the gasoline dealer prevails in the action, the dealer may recover actual damages sustained, the costs of the suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and such equitable relief as the court deems proper. </P>
<P>&#9;The court may also grant such temporary relief as it may deem necessary and proper. </P>

<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Of other legitimate business reasons; provided that a termination, cancellation, or failure to renew a franchise for the purpose of enabling the petroleum distributor to assume operation of the gasoline dealer's business shall not be considered to be a legitimate business reason unless the gasoline dealer is paid reasonable compensation for the value of the dealer's franchise, including good will. </P></DIR>
