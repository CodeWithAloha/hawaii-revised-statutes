<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: </B> None.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  This section is new, although similar statutory provisions are in existence in seven states.</P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (1) follows existing decisions which hold that a drawee (payor) bank is not liable for the payment of a check before it has notice of the death or incompetence of the drawer.  The justice and necessity of the rule are obvious.  A check is an order to pay which the bank must obey under penalty of possible liability for dishonor.  Further, with the tremendous volume of items handled any rule which required banks to verify the continued life and competency of drawers would be completely unworkable.</P>
<P>  One or both of these same reasons apply to other phases of the bank collection and payment process and the rule is made wide enough to apply to these other phases.  It applies to all kinds of "items"; to "customers" who own items as well as "customers" who draw or make them; to the function of collecting items as well as the function of accepting or paying them; to the carrying out of instructions to account for proceeds even though these may involve transfers to third parties; to depositary and intermediary banks as well as payor banks; and to incompetency existing at the time of the issuance of an item or the commencement of the collection or payment process as well as to incompetency occurring thereafter.  Further, the requirement of actual knowledge makes inapplicable the rule of some cases that an adjudication of incompetency is constructive notice to all the world because obviously it is as impossible for banks to keep posted on such adjudications (in the absence of actual knowledge) as it is to keep posted as to death of immediate or remote customers.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsection (2) provides a limited period after death during which a bank may continue to pay checks (as distinguished from other items) even though it has notice.  The purpose of the provision, as of the existing statutes, is to permit holders of checks drawn and issued shortly before death to cash them without the necessity of filing a claim in probate.  The justification is that such checks normally are given in immediate payment of an obligation, that there is almost never any reason why they should not be paid, and that filing in probate is a useless formality, burdensome to the holder, the executor, the court and the bank.</P>
<P>  This section does not prevent an executor or administrator from recovering the payment from the holder of the check.  It is not intended to affect the validity of any gift causa mortis or other transfer in contemplation of death, but merely to relieve the bank of liability for the payment.</P>
<P>  4.  Any surviving relative, creditor or other person who claims an interest in the account may give a direction to the bank not to pay checks, or not to pay a particular check.  Such notice has the same effect as a direction to stop payment.  The bank has no responsibility to determine the validity of the claim or even whether it is "colorable".  But obviously anyone who has an interest in the estate, including the person named as executor in a will, even if the will has not yet been admitted to probate, is entitled to claim an interest in the account.</P>
