<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Sections 13(3), 13(4), Uniform Trust Receipts Act; Section 10, Uniform Conditional Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Changed in substance.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Prior law was not always clear whether a mortgage filed for record gave constructive notice from the time of presentation to the filing officer or only from the time of indexing.  Subsection (1) adopts the former position.</P>
<P>  2.  Prior statutes have usually limited the effectiveness of a filing to a specified period of time after which refiling is necessary.  Subsection (2) follows the same policy, establishing a maximum length of five years as the filing period.  If the financing statement states a maturity date of five years or less, there is added a sixty-day grace period within which the original filing may be continued without lapse.  A financing statement which states that the obligation secured is payable on demand is treated as one which does not state a maturity date.  The five year maximum period is substantially longer than that accorded under most prior statutes.  Subsection (3) provides for the filing of one or more continuation statements (which need be signed only by the secured party) if it is desired to continue the effectiveness of the original filing.</P>
<P>  3.  Under the fourth sentence of subsection (2) the security interest becomes unperfected when filing lapses.  Thereafter, the interest of the secured party is subject to defeat by those persons who take priority over an unperfected security interest (see Section 9-301), and under Section 9-312(5) the holder of a perfected conflicting security interest is such a person even though before lapse the conflicting interest was junior.  Compare the situation arising under Section 9-103(3) when a perfected security interest under the law of another jurisdiction is not perfected in this state within four months after the property is brought into this state.</P>
<P>  Thus if A and B both make non-purchase money advances against the same collateral, and both perfect security interests by filing, A who files first is entitled to priority under Section 9-312(5)(a).  But if no continuation statement is filed, A's filing may lapse first.  So long as B's interest remains perfected thereafter, he is entitled to priority over A's unperfected interest.  This rule avoids the circular priority which arose under some prior statutes, under which A was subordinate to the debtor's trustee in bankruptcy, A retained priority over B, and B's interest was valid against the trustee in bankruptcy.  In re Andrews, 172 F.2d 996 (7th Cir. 1949).</P>
