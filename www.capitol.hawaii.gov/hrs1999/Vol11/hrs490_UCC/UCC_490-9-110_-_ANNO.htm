</B><P>  The requirement of description of collateral (see Section 9-203 and Comment thereto) is evidentiary.  The test of sufficiency of a description laid down by this Section is that the description do the job assigned to it - that it make possible the identification of the thing described.  Under this rule courts should refuse to follow the holdings, often found in the older chattel mortgage cases, that descriptions are insufficient unless they are of the most exact and detailed nature, the so-called "serial number" test.  The same test of reasonable identification applies where a description of real estate is required in a financing statement.  See Section 9-402.</P>
