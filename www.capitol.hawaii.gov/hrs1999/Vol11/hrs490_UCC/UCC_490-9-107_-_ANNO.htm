<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  None.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Under existing rules of law and under this Article purchase money obligations often have priority over other obligations.  Thus a purchase money obligation has priority over an interest acquired under an after-acquired property clause (Section 9-312(3) and (4)); where filing is required a grace period of ten days is allowed against creditors and transferees in bulk (Section 9-301(2)); and in some instances filing may not be necessary (Section 9-302(1)(c) and (d)).</P>
<P>  Under this Section a seller has a purchase money security interest if he retains a security interest in the goods; a financing agency has a purchase money security interest when it advances money to the seller, taking back an assignment of chattel paper, and also when it makes advances to the buyer (e.g., on chattel mortgage) to enable him to buy, and he uses the money for that purpose.</P>
<P>  2.  When a purchase money interest is claimed by a secured party who is not a seller, he must of course have given present consideration.  This Section therefore provides that the purchase money party must be one who gives value "by making advances or incurring an obligation" the quoted language excludes from the purchase money category any security interest taken as security for or in satisfaction of a pre-existing claim or antecedent debt.</P>
