<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§490:8-304  Indorsement.</B>  (a)  An indorsement may be in blank or special.  An indorsement in blank includes an indorsement to bearer.  A special indorsement specifies to whom a security is to be transferred or who has power to transfer it.  A holder may convert a blank indorsement to a special indorsement.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security certificate representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  An indorsement, whether special or in blank, does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the certificate on which it appears or, if the indorsement is on a separate document, until delivery of both the document and the certificate.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied.  However, against a transferor, a transfer is complete upon delivery and the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary indorsement supplied.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  An indorsement of a security certificate in bearer form may give notice of an adverse claim to the certificate, but it does not otherwise affect a right to registration that the holder possesses.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Unless otherwise agreed, a person making an indorsement assumes only the obligations provided in section 490:8-108 and not an obligation that the security will be honored by the issuer. [L 1997, c 33, pt of §2]</P>
