<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  Under this Article the secured party's right to possession of the collateral (if he is not already in possession as pledgee) accrues on default unless otherwise agreed in the security agreement.  This Article follows the provisions of the earlier uniform legislation in allowing the secured party in most cases to take possession without the issuance of judicial process.  In the case of collateral such as heavy equipment, the physical removal from the debtor's plant and the storage of the equipment pending resale may be exceedingly expensive and in some cases impractical.  The Section therefore provides that in lieu of removal the lender may render equipment unusable or dispose of collateral on the debtor's premises.  The authorization to render equipment unusable or to dispose of collateral without removal would not justify unreasonable action by the secured party, since, under Section 9-504(3), all his actions in connection with disposition must be taken in a "commercially reasonable manner".</P>
