<P>&#9;"Account debtor" means the person who is obligated on an account, chattel paper, or general intangible.</P>
<P>&#9;"Chattel paper" means a writing or writings which evidence both a monetary obligation and a security interest in or a lease of specific goods, but a charter or other contract involving the use or a hire of a vessel is not chattel paper.  When a transaction is evidenced both by such a security agreement or a lease and by an instrument or a series of instruments, the group of writings taken together constitutes chattel paper.</P>
<P>&#9;"Collateral" means the property subject to a security interest, and includes accounts and chattel paper which have been sold.</P>
<P>&#9;"Debtor" means the person who owes payment or other performance of the obligation secured, whether or not the person owns or has rights in the collateral, and includes the seller of accounts or chattel paper.  Where the debtor and the owner of the collateral are not the same person, the term "debtor" means the owner of the collateral in any provision of the Article dealing with the collateral, the obligor in any provision dealing with the obligation, and may include both where the context so requires.</P>
<P>&#9;"Deposit account" means a demand, time, savings, passbook, or like account maintained with a bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or like organization, other than an account evidenced by a negotiable certificate of deposit.</P>

<P>&#9;"Encumbrance" includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests.</P>

"Goods" also includes standing timber which is to be cut and removed under a conveyance or contract for sale, the unborn young of animals, and growing crops.</P>
<P>&#9;"Instrument" means a negotiable instrument (defined in section 490:3-104), or any other writing which evidences a right to the payment of money and is not itself a security agreement or lease and is of a type which is in ordinary course of business transferred by delivery with any necessary indorsement or assignment.  The term does not include investment property.</P>
<P>&#9;"Mortgage" means a consensual interest created by a real estate mortgage, a trust deed on real estate, or the like.</P>
<P>&#9;An advance is made "pursuant to commitment" if the secured party has bound the party's self to make it, whether or not a subsequent event not within the party's control has relieved or may relieve the party from the party's obligation.</P>
<P>&#9;"Security agreement" means an agreement which creates or provides for a security interest.</P>
<P>&#9;"Secured party" means a lender, seller, or other person in whose favor there is a security interest, including a person to whom accounts or chattel paper have been sold.
