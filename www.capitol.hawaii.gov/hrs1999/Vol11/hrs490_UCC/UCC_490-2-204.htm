<P>&#9;(2)  An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sales does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy. [L 1965, c 208, §2-204; HRS §490:2-204]</P>
