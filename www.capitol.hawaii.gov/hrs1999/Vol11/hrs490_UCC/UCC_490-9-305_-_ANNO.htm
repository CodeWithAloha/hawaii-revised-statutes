<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  As under the common law of pledge, no filing is required by this Article to perfect a security interest where the secured party has possession of the collateral.  Compare Section 9-302(1)(a).  This Section permits a security interest to be perfected by transfer of possession only when the collateral is goods, instruments, documents or chattel paper:  that is to say, accounts, contract rights and general intangibles are excluded.  See Section 5-116 for the special case of assignments of letters and advices of credit.  A security interest in accounts, contract rights and general intangibles - property not ordinarily represented by any writing whose delivery operates to transfer the claim - may under this Article be perfected only by filing, and this rule would not be affected by the fact that a security agreement or other writing described the assignment of such collateral as a "pledge".  Section 9-302(1)(e) exempts from filing certain assignments of accounts or contract rights which are out of the ordinary course of financing:  such exempted assignments are perfected when they attach under Section 9-303(1); they do not fall within this Section.</P>
<P>  2.  Possession may be by the secured party himself or by an agent on his behalf:  it is of course clear, however, that the debtor or a person controlled by him cannot qualify as such an agent for the secured party.  See also the last sentence of Section 9-205.  Where the collateral (except for goods covered by a negotiable document) is held by a bailee, the time of perfection of the security interest, under the second sentence of the Section, is when the bailee receives notification of the secured party's interest:  this rule rejects the common law doctrine that it is necessary for the bailee to attorn to the secured party or acknowledge that he now holds on his behalf.</P>
<P>  3.  The third sentence of the Section rejects the "equitable pledge" theory of relation back, under which the taking possession was deemed to relate back to the date of the original security agreement.  The relation back theory has had little vitality since the 1938 revision of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, which introduced in Section 60(a) provisions designed to make such interests voidable as preferences in bankruptcy proceedings.  This Section now brings state law into conformity with the overriding federal policy:  where a pledge transaction is contemplated, perfection dates only from the time possession is taken, although a security interest may attach, unperfected, before that under the rules stated in Section 9-204.  The only exception to this rule is the short twenty-one day period of perfection provided in Section 9-304(4) and (5), during which a debtor may have possession of specified collateral in which there is a perfected security interest.</P>
