<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  To make clear what would of course be true without the Section, that applicable Federal law is paramount.</P>
<P>  2.  To make clear also that regulatory state statutes (such as those fixing or authorizing a commission to fix rates and prescribe services, authorizing different charges for goods of different values, and limiting liability for loss to the declared value on which the charge was based) are not affected by the Article and are controlling on the matters which they cover.  Notice that the reference is not only to such statutes, but to tariffs, classifications and regulations filed or issued pursuant to them.</P>
