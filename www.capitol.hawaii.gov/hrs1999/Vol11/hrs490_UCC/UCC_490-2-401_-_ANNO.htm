<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  See generally, Sections 17, 18, 19 and 20, Uniform Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</B>  To make it clear that:</P>
<P>  1.  This Article deals with the issues between seller and buyer in terms of step by step performance or non-performance under the contract for sale and not in terms of whether or not "title" to the goods has passed.  That the rules of this section in no way alter the rights of either the buyer, seller or third parties declared elsewhere in the Article is made clear by the preamble of this section.  This section, however, in no way intends to indicate which line of interpretation should be followed in cases where the applicability of "public" regulation depends upon a "sale" or upon location of "title" without further definition.  The basic policy of this Article that known purpose and reason should govern interpretation cannot extend beyond the scope of its own provisions.  It is therefore necessary to state what a "sale" is and when title passes under this Article in case the courts deem any public regulation to incorporate the defined term of the "private" law.</P>
<P>  2.  "Future" goods cannot be the subject of a present sale.  Before title can pass the goods must be identified in the manner set forth in Section 2-501.  The parties, however, have full liberty to arrange by specific terms for the passing of title to goods which are existing.</P>
<P>  3.  The "special property" of the buyer in goods identified to the contract is excluded from the definition of "security interest"; its incidents are defined in provisions of this Article such as those on the rights of the seller's creditors, on good faith purchase, on the buyer's right to goods on the seller's insolvency, and on the buyer's right to specific performance or replevin.</P>
<P>  4.  The factual situations in subsections (2) and (3) upon which passage of title turn actually base the test upon the time when the seller has finally committed himself in regard to specific goods.  Thus in a "shipment" contract he commits himself by the act of making the shipment.  If shipment is not contemplated subsection (3) turns on the seller's final commitment, i.e. the delivery of documents or the making of the contract.</P>
