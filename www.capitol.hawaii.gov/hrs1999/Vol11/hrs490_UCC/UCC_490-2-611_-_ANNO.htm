<P>  <B>Purposes:</B>  To make it clear that:</P>
<P>  1.  The repudiating party's right to reinstate the contract is entirely dependent upon the action taken by the aggrieved party.  If the latter has cancelled the contract or materially changed his position at any time after the repudiation, there can be no retraction under this section.</P>
<P>  2.  Under subsection (2) an effective retraction must be accompanied by any assurances demanded under the section dealing with right to adequate assurance.  A repudiation is of course sufficient to give reasonable ground for insecurity and to warrant a request for assurance as an essential condition of the retraction.  However, after a timely and unambiguous expression of retraction, a reasonable time for the assurance to be worked out should be allowed by the aggrieved party before cancellation.</P>
