<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  </B>Section 23, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:  </B>Rewritten in part.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  The provision as to misdating in subsection (1) conforms to the policy of the amendment to the Federal Bills of Lading Act by 44 Stat. 1450 (1927), as amended 49 U.S.C. Section 102, after the holding in Browne v. Union Pac. R. Co., 113 Kan. 726, 216 P. 299 (1923), affirmed on other grounds 267 U.S. 255, 45 S.Ct. 315, 69 L.Ed. 601 (1925).  Subsections (2) and (3) conform to the policy of the Federal Bills of Lading Act, 49 U.S.C. Sections 100, 101, and the laws of several states.  See, e.g., N.Y.Pers.Prop. Law Section 209; Report of N.Y. Law Revision Commission, N.Y.Leg.Doc. (1941) No. 65(F).</P>
<P>  2.  The language of the old Uniform Act suggested that a carrier is ordinarily liable for damage caused by improper loading, but may relieve himself of liability by disclosing on the bill that shipper actually loaded.  A more accurate statement of the law is that the carrier is not liable for losses caused by act or default of the shipper, which would include improper loading.  There is some question whether under present law a carrier is liable even to a good faith purchaser of a negotiable bill for such losses, if the shipper's faulty loading in fact caused the loss.  It is this doubtful liability which subsection (4) permits the carrier to bar by disclosure of shipper's loading.  There is no implication that decisions such as Modern Tool Corp. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 100 F.Supp. 595 (D.N.J.1951), are disapproved.</P>
<P>  3.  This section is a simplified restatement of existing law as to the method by which a bailee may avoid responsibility for the accuracy of descriptions which are made by or in reliance upon information furnished by the depositor or shipper.  The issuer is liable on documents issued by an agent, contrary to instructions of his principal, without receiving goods.  No disclaimer of this liability is permitted since it is not a matter either of the care of the goods or their description.</P>
<P>  4.  The shipper's erroneous report to the carrier concerning the goods may cause damage to the carrier.  Subsection (5) therefore provides appropriate indemnity.</P>
