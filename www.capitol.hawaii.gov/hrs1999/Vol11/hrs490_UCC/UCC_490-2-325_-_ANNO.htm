<P>  <B>Purposes:</B>  To express the established commercial and banking understanding as to the meaning and effects of term calling for "letters of credit" or "confirmed credit":</P>
<P>  1.  Subsection (2) follows the general policy of this Article and Article 3 (Section 3-802) on conditional payment, under which payment by check or other short-term instrument is not ordinarily final as between the parties if the recipient duly presents the instrument and honor is refused.  Thus the furnishing of a letter of credit does not substitute the financing agency's obligation for the buyer's, but the seller must first give the buyer reasonable notice of his intention to demand direct payment from him.</P>
<P>  2.  Subsection (3) requires that the credit be irrevocable and be a prime credit as determined by the standing of the issuer.  It is not necessary, unless otherwise agreed, that the credit be a negotiation credit; the seller can finance himself by an assignment of the proceeds under Section 5-116(2).</P>
<P>  3.  The definition of "confirmed credit" is drawn on the supposition that the credit is issued by a bank which is not doing direct business in the seller's financial market; there is no intention to require the obligation of two banks both local to the seller.</P>
