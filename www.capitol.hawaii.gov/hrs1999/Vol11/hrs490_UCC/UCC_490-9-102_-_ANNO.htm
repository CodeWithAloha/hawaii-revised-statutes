<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  None.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  The purpose of this Section is to bring all consensual security interests in personal property and fixtures, with the exception of certain types of transactions excluded by Sections 9-103 and 9-104, under this Article, as well as sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel paper whether intended for security or not unless excluded by Section 9-104(f).  As to security interests in fixtures created under the law applicable to real estate, see Section 9-313(1).</P>
<P>  1.  Except for sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel paper, the principal test whether a transaction comes under this Article is the transaction intended to have effect as security?  For example, Section 9-104 excludes certain transactions where the security interest (such as an artisan's lien) arises under statute or common law by reason of status and not by consent of the parties.  Transactions in the form of consignments or leases are subject to this Article if the understanding of the parties or the effect of the arrangement shows that a security interest was intended.  (As to consignments the provisions of Section 2-326 of Article 2 (Sales) should be consulted.)  When it is found that a security interest as defined in Section 1-201(37) was intended, this Article applies regardless of the form of the transaction or the name by which the parties may have christened it.  The list of traditional security devices in subsection (2) is illustrative only; other old devices, as well as any new ones which the ingenuity of lawyers may invent, are included, so long as the requisite intent is found.  The controlling definition is that contained in subsection (1).  In connection with the inclusion of "equipment trust" in the subsection (2) list, it should be noted that Section 9-104(e) excludes from the Article equipment trusts on railway rolling stock.</P>
<P>  2.  The Article does not in terms abolish existing security devices.  The conditional sale or bailment-lease for example is not prohibited; but even though it is used, the rules of this Article govern.</P>
<P>  3.  In general this Article adopts the position, implicit in prior law, that the law of the state where the collateral is located should be the governing law, without regard to possible contacts in other jurisdictions.  Thus the applicability of the Article is by this Section stated to extend to transactions concerning "personal property and fixtures within the jurisdiction of this state".  This "narrow" approach, appropriate in the field of security transactions, should be contrasted with the "broad" approach stated in Section 1-105 with reference to the applicability of the Act as a whole.  Section 9-103 states special rules relating to the applicability of this Article where the collateral consists of certain types of intangibles or mobile equipment, or property which is brought into this state subject to a security interest which attached in another jurisdiction.</P>
<P>  4.  An illustration of subsection (3) is as follows:</P>
<P>  The owner of Blackacre borrows $10,000 from his neighbor, and secures his note by a mortgage on Blackacre.  This Article is not applicable to the creation of the real estate mortgage.  However, when the mortgagee in turn pledges this note and mortgage to secure his own obligation to X, this Article is applicable to the security interest thus created in the note and the mortgage.  Whether the transfer of the collateral for the note, i.e., the mortgagee's interest in Blackacre, requires further action (such as recording an assignment of the mortgagee's interest) is left to real estate law.  See Section 9-104(j).</P>
<P>  5.  While most sections of this Article apply to a security interest without regard to the nature of the collateral or its use, some sections state special rules with reference to particular types of collateral.  An index of sections where such special rules are stated follows:</P>
