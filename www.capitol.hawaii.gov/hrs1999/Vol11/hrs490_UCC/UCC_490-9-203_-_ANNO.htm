<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 2, Uniform Trust Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Adapted to fit the scheme of this Article.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Here as elsewhere in this Article, following the policy of the Uniform Trust Receipts Act, formal requisites are reduced to a minimum.  The technical requirements of acknowledgment, accompanying affidavits, etc., common to much chattel mortgage legislation, are abandoned.  The only requirements for the enforceability of non-possessory security interests in cases not involving land are (a) a writing; (b) the debtor's signature; and (c) a description of the collateral or kinds of collateral.  (Typically, of course, the agreement will contain much more.)  As to the type of description which will satisfy the requirements of this Section, see Section 9-110 and Comment thereto.</P>
<P>  2.  In the case of crops, or timber growing on land, or of gas or oil or minerals to be extracted, the best identification is by describing the land and subsection (1)(b) requires such a description.</P>
<P>  3.  One purpose of the formal requisites stated in subsection (1)(b) is evidentiary.  The requirement of written record minimizes the possibility of future dispute as to the terms of a security agreement and as to what property stands as collateral for the obligation secured.  Where the collateral is in the possession of the secured party, the evidentiary need for a written record is much less than where the collateral is in the debtor's possession; customarily, of course, as a matter of business practice the written record will be kept, but, in this Article as at common law, the writing is not a formal requisite.  Subsection (1)(a), therefore, dispenses with the written agreement - and thus with signature and description - if the collateral is in the secured party's possession.</P>
<P>  4.  The definition of "security agreement" (Section 9-105) is "an agreement which creates or provides for a security interest".  Under that definition the requirement of this Section that the debtor sign a security agreement is not intended to reject, and does not reject, the deeply rooted doctrine that a bill of sale although absolute in form may be shown to have been in fact given as security.  Under this Article as under prior law a debtor may show by parol evidence that a transfer purporting to be absolute was in fact for security and may then, on payment of the debt, assert his fundamental right to return of the collateral and execution of an acknowledgment of satisfaction.</P>
<P>  5.  The formal requisites stated in this Section are not only conditions to the enforceability of a security interest against third parties.  They are in the nature of a Statute of Frauds.  Unless the secured party is in possession of the collateral, his security interest, absent a writing which satisfies subsection (1)(b), is not enforceable even against the debtor, and cannot be made so on any theory of equitable mortgage or the like.  If he has advanced money, he is of course a creditor and, like any creditor, is entitled after judgment to appropriate process to enforce his claim against his debtor's assets; he will not, however, have against his debtor the rights given a secured party by Part 5 of this Article on Default.  The theory of equitable mortgage, insofar as it has operated to allow creditors to enforce informal security agreements against debtors, may well have developed as a necessary escape from the elaborate requirements of execution, acknowledgment and the like which the nineteenth century chattel mortgage acts vainly relied on as a deterrent to fraud.  Since this Article reduces formal requisites to a minimum, the doctrine is no longer necessary or useful.  More harm than good would result from allowing creditors to establish a secured status by parol evidence after they have neglected the simple formality of obtaining a signed writing.</P>
<P>  6.  Subsection (2) states that the provisions of regulatory statutes covering the field of consumer finance prevail over the provisions of this Article in case of conflict.  The second sentence of the subsection is added to make clear that no doctrine of total voidness for illegality is intended failure to comply with the applicable regulatory statute has whatever effect may be specified in that statute, but no more.</P>
