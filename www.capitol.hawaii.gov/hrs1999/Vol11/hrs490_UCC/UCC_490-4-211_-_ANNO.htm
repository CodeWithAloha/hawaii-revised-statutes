<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: </B> Negotiable Instruments Law, Section 27.</P>
<B><P>  Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  The section completes the thought of the previous section and makes clear that a security interest in an item is "value" for the purpose of determining the holder's status as a holder in due course.  The provision is in accord with the prior law (N.I.L. Section 27) and with Article 3 (Section 3-303).  The section does not prescribe a security interest under Section 4-208 as a test of "value" generally because the meaning of "value" under other Articles is adequately defined in Section 1-201.</P>
