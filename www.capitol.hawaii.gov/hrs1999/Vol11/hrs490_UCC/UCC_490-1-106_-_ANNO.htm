<B><P> </B> <B>Purposes</B> <B>of</B> <B>Changes</B> <B>and</B> <B>New</B> <B>Matter:</B>  Subsection (1) is intended to effect three things:</P>
<P>  1.  First, to negate the unduly narrow or technical interpretation of some remedial provisions of prior legislation by providing that the remedies in this Act are to be liberally administered to the end stated in the section.  Second, to make it clear that compensatory damages are limited to compensation.  They do not include consequential or special damages, or penal damages; and the Act elsewhere makes it clear that damages must be minimized.  Cf.  Sections 1-203, 2-706(1), and 2-712(2).  The third purpose of subsection (1) is to reject any doctrine that damages must be calculable with mathematical accuracy.  Compensatory damages are often at best approximate:  they have to be proved with whatever definiteness and accuracy the facts permit, but no more.  Cf.  Section 2-204(3).</P>
<P>  2.  Under subsection (2) any right or obligation described in this Act is enforceable by court action, even though no remedy may be expressly provided, unless a particular provision specifies a different and limited effect.  Whether specific performance or other equitable relief is available is determined not by this section but by specific provisions and by supplementary principles.  Cf.  Sections 1-103, 2-716.</P>
<P>  3.  "Consequential" or "special" damages and "penal" damages are not defined in terms in the Code, but are used in the sense given them by the leading cases on the subject.</P>
