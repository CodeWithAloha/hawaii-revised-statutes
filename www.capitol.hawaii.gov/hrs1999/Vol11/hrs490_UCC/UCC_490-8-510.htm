<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§490:8-510  Rights of purchaser of security entitlement from entitlement holder.</B>  (a)  An action based on an adverse claim to a financial asset or security entitlement, whether framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory, may not be asserted against a person who purchases a security entitlement, or an interest therein, from an entitlement holder if the purchaser gives value, does not have notice of the adverse claim, and obtains control.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If an adverse claim could not have been asserted against an entitlement holder under section 490:8-502, the adverse claim cannot be asserted against a person who purchases a security entitlement, or an interest therein, from the entitlement holder.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In a case not covered by the priority rules in article 9, a purchaser for value of a security entitlement, or an interest therein, who obtains control has priority over a purchaser of a security entitlement, or an interest therein, who does not obtain control.  Purchasers who have control rank equally, except that a securities intermediary as purchaser has priority over a conflicting purchaser who has control unless otherwise agreed by the securities intermediary.
