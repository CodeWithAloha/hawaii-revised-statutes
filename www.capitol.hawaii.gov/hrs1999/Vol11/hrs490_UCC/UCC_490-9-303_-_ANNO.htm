<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  The term "attach" is used in this Article to describe the point at which property becomes subject to a security interest.  The requisites for attachment are stated in Section 9-204.  When it attaches a security interest may be either perfected or unperfected:  "Perfected" means that the secured party has taken all the steps required by this Article as specified in the several sections listed in subsection (1).  A perfected security interest may still be or become subordinate to other interests (see Section 9-312) but in general after perfection the secured party is protected against creditors and transferees of the debtor and in particular against any representative of creditors in insolvency proceedings instituted by or against the debtor.  Subsection (1) states the truism that the time of perfection is when the security interest has attached and any necessary steps for perfection (such as taking possession or filing) have been taken.  If the steps for perfection have been taken in advance (as when the secured party files a financing statement before giving value or before the debtor acquires rights in the collateral), then the interest is perfected automatically when it attaches.</P>
<P>  2.  The following example will illustrate the operation of subsection (2):  A bank which has issued a letter of credit honors drafts drawn under the credit and receives possession of the negotiable bill of lading covering the goods shipped.  Under Sections 9-304(2) and 9-305 the bank now has a perfected security interest in the document and the goods.  The bank releases the bill of lading to the debtor for the purpose of procuring the goods from the carrier and selling them.  Under Section 9-304(5) the bank continues to have a perfected security interest in the document and goods for 21 days.  The bank files before the expiration of the 21 day period.  Its security interest now continues perfected for as long as the filing is good.  The goods are sold by the debtor.  The bank continues to have a security interest in the proceeds of sale to the extent stated in Section 9-306(3).</P>
<P>  If the successive stages of the bank's security interest succeed each other without an intervening gap, the security interest is "continuously perfected" and the date of perfection is when the interest first became perfected (i.e., in the example given, when the bank received possession of the bill of lading against honor of the drafts).  If, however, there is a gap between stages - for example, if the bank does not file until after the expiration of the 21 day period specified in Section 9-304(5), the collateral still being in the debtor's possession - then, the chain being broken, the perfection is no longer continuous.  The date of perfection would now be the date of filing (after expiration of the 21 day period); the bank's interest might now become subject to attack under Section 60 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act and would be subject to any interests arising during the gap period which under Section 9-301 take priority over an unperfected security interest.</P>
<P>  The rule of subsection (2) would also apply to the case of collateral brought into this state subject to a security interest which became perfected in another state or jurisdiction.  See Section 9-103(3).</P>
