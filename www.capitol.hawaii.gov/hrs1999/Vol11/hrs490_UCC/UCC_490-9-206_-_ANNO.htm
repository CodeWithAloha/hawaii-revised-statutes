<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Clauses are frequently inserted in conditional sale contracts under which the conditional vendee agrees not to assert defenses against an assignee of the contract.  These clauses have led to litigation and their present status under the case law is in confusion.  In some jurisdictions they have been held void as attempts to create negotiable instruments outside the framework of the Negotiable Instruments Law or on grounds of public policy; in others they have been allowed to operate to cut off at least defenses based on breach of warranty.  Under subsection (1) such clauses in a security agreement are validated outside the consumer field, but only as to defenses which could be cut off if a negotiable instrument were used.  This limitation is important since if the clauses were allowed to have full effect as typically drafted they would operate to cut off real as well as personal defenses.  The execution of a negotiable note in connection with a security agreement is given like effect as the execution of an agreement containing a waiver of defense clause.  The same rules are made applicable to leases as to security agreements, whether or not the lease is intended as security.</P>
<P>  2.  This Article takes no position on the controversial question whether a buyer of consumer goods may effectively waive defenses by contractual clause or by execution of a negotiable note.  In some states such waivers have been invalidated by statute.  In other states the course of judicial decision has rendered them ineffective or unreliable - courts have found that the assignee is not protected against the buyer's defense by a clause in the contract or that the holder of a note, by reason of his too close connection with the underlying transaction, does not have the rights of a holder in due course.  This Article neither adopts nor rejects the approach taken in such statutes and decisions, except that the validation of waivers in subsection (1) is expressly made "subject to any statute or decision" which may restrict the waiver's effectiveness in the case of a buyer of consumer goods.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsection (2) makes clear, as did Section 2 of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act, that purchase money security transactions are sales, and warranty rules for sales are applicable.  It also prevents a buyer from inadvertently abandoning his warranties by a "no warranties" term in the security agreement when warranties have already been created under the sales arrangement.  Where the sales arrangement and the purchase money security transaction are evidenced by only one writing, that writing may disclaim, limit or modify warranties to the extent permitted by Article 2.</P>
