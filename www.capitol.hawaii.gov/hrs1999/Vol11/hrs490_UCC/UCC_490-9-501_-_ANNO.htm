<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 6, Uniform Trust Receipts Act; Sections 16 through 26, Uniform Conditional Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Modified to conform to the scheme of this Article.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes of Changes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  The rights of the secured party in the collateral after the debtor's default are of the essence of a security transaction.  These are the rights which distinguish the secured from the unsecured lender.  This Section and the following six sections state those rights as well as the limi</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>t</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>ations on their free exercise which legislative policy requires for the protection not only of the defaulting debtor but of other creditors.  But subsections (1) and (2) make it clear that the statement of rights and remedies in this Part does not exclude other remedies provided by agreement.</P>
<P>  2.  Following default and the taking possession of the collateral by the secured party, there is no longer any distinction between the security interest which before default was non-possessory and that which was possessory under a pledge.  Therefore no general distinction is taken in this Part between the rights of a non-possessory secured party and those of a pledgee; the latter, being in possession of the collateral at default, will of course not have to avail himself of the right to take possession under Section 9-503.</P>
<P>  3.  Section 9-207 states rights, remedies and duties with respect to collateral in the secured party's possession.  That section applies not only to the situation where he is in possession before default, as a pledgee, but also, by subsections (1) and (2) of this Section, to the secured party in possession after default.  Nevertheless the relations of the parties have been changed by default and Section 9-207 as it applies after default must be read together with this Part.  In particular, agreements permitted under Section 9-207 cannot waive or modify the rights of the debtor contrary to subsection (3) of this Section.</P>
<P>  4.  Section 1-102(3) states rules to determine which provisions of this Act are mandatory and which may be varied by agreement.  In general, provisions which relate to matters which come up between immediate parties may be varied by agreement.  In the area of rights after default our legal system has traditionally looked with suspicion on agreements designed to cut down the debtor's rights and free the secured party of his duties:  no mortgage clause has ever been allowed to clog the equity of redemption.  The default situation offers great scope for overreaching; the suspicious attitude of the courts has been grounded in common sense.</P>
<P>  Subsection (3) of this Section contains a codification of this long-standing and deeply rooted attitude:  the specified rights of the debtor and duties of the secured party may not be waived or varied except as stated.  Provisions not specified in subsection (3) are subject to the general rules stated in Section 1-102(3).</P>
<P>  5.  The collateral for many corporate security issues consists of both real and personal property.  In the interest of simplicity and speed subsection (4) permits, although it does not require, the secured party to proceed as to both real and personal property in accordance with his rights and remedies in respect of the real property.  Except for the permission so granted, this Act leaves to other state law all questions of procedure with respect to real property.  For example, this Act does not determine whether the secured party can proceed against the real estate alone and later proceed in a separate action against the personal property in accordance with his rights and remedies against the real estate.  By such separate actions the secured party "proceeds as to both," and this Part does not apply in either action.  But subsection (4) does give him an option to proceed under this Part as to the personal property.</P>
<P>  6.  Under subsection (1) a secured party is entitled to reduce his claim to judgment or to foreclose his interest by any available procedure, outside this Article, which state law may provide.  The first sentence of subsection (5) makes clear that any judgment lien which the secured party may acquire against the collateral is, so to say, a continuation of his original interest (if perfected) and not the acquisition of a new interest or a transfer of property to satisfy an antecedent debt.  The judgment lien is therefore stated to relate back to the date of perfection of the security interest.  The second sentence of the subsection makes clear that a judicial sale following judgment, execution and levy is one of the methods of foreclosure contemplated by subsection (1); such a sale is governed by other law and not by this Article and the restrictions which this Article imposes on the right of a secured party to buy in the collateral at a sale under Section 9-504 do not apply.</P>
