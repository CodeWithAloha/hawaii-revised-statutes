<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 9(a), Uniform Trust Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  No changes in substance.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Under this Article as at common law and under prior statutes the rights of purchasers of negotiable paper, including negotiable documents of title and investment securities, are determined by the rules of holding in due course and the like which are applicable to the type of paper concerned.  (Articles 3, 7, and 8.)  This Section, as did Section 9(a) of the Uniform Trust Receipts Act, makes explicit the rule which was implicitly but universally recognized under earlier statutes.</P>
<P>  2.  Under Section 9-304(1) filing is ineffective to perfect a security interest in instruments (including securities) and of course is ineffective to constitute notice to subsequent purchasers.  Although filing is permissible as a method of perfection for a security interest in documents, this Section follows the policy of the Uniform Trust Receipts Act in providing that the filing does not constitute notice to purchasers.</P>
