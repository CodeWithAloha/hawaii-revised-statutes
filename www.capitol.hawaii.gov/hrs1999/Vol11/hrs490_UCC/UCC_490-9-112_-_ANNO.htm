<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  None.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  Under the definition of Section 9-105, in any provisions of the Article dealing with the collateral the term "debtor" means the owner of the collateral even though he is not the person who owes payment or performance of the obligation secured.  This Section covers several situations in which the implications of this definition are specifically set out.</P>
<P>  The duties which this Section imposes on a secured party toward such an owner of collateral are conditioned on the secured party's knowledge of the true state of facts.  Short of such knowledge he may continue to deal exclusively with the person who owes the obligation.  Nor does the Section suggest that the secured party is under any duty of inquiry.  It does not purport to cut across the law of conversion or of ultra vires.  Whether a person who does not own property has authority to encumber it for his own debts and whether a person is free to encumber his property as collateral for the debts of another, are matters to be decided under other rules of law and are not covered by this Section.</P>
<P>  The Section does not purport to be an exhaustive treatment of the subject.  It isolates certain problems which may be expected to arise and states rules as to them.  Others will no doubt arise:  their solution is left to the courts.</P>
