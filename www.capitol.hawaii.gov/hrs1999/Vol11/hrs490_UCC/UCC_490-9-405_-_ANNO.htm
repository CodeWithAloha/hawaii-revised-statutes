<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  This Section provides a permissive device whereby a secured party who has assigned all or part of his interest may have the assignment noted of record.  Note that under Section 9-302(2) no filing of such an assignment is required as a condition of continuing the perfected status of the security interest against creditors and transferees of the original debtor.  A secured party who has assigned his interest might wish to have the fact noted of record, so that inquiries concerning the transaction would be addressed not to him but to the assignee (see Point 2 of Comment to Section 9-402).  After a secured party has assigned his rights of record, the assignee becomes the "secured party of record" and may file a continuation statement under Section 9-403, a termination statement under Section 9-404, or a statement of release under Section 9-406.</P>
