<P> <B> Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  None.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Generally, this section recognizes both delegation of performance and assignability as normal and permissible incidents of a contract for the sale of goods.</P>
<P>  2.  Delegation of performance, either in conjunction with an assignment or otherwise, is provided for by subsection (1) where no substantial reason can be shown as to why the delegated performance will not be as satisfactory as personal performance.</P>
<P>  3.  Under subsection (2) rights which are no longer executory such as a right to damages for breach or a right to payment of an "account" as defined in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9) may be assigned although the agreement prohibits assignment.  In such cases no question of delegation of any performance is involved.  The assignment of a "contract right" as defined in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9) is not covered by this subsection.</P>
<P>  4.  The nature of the contract or the circumstances of the case, however, may bar assignment of the contract even where delegation of performance is not involved.  This Article and this section are intended to clarify this problem, particularly in cases dealing with output requirement and exclusive dealing contracts.  In the first place the section on requirements and exclusive dealing removes from the construction of the original contract most of the "personal discretion" element by substituting the reasonably objective standard of good faith operation of the plant or business to be supplied.  Secondly, the section on insecurity and assurances, which is specifically referred to in subsection (5) of this section, frees the other party from the doubts and uncertainty which may afflict him under an assignment of the character in question by permitting him to demand adequate assurance of due performance without which he may suspend his own performance.  Subsection (5) is not in any way intended to limit the effect of the section on insecurity and assurances and the word "performance" includes the giving of orders under a requirements contract.  Of course, in any case where a material personal discretion is sought to be transferred, effective assignment is barred by subsection (2).</P>
<P>  5.  Subsection (4) lays down a general rule of construction distinguishing between a normal commercial assignment, which substitutes the assignee for the assignor both as to rights and duties, and a financing assignment in which only the assignor's rights are transferred.</P>
<P>  This Article takes no position on the possibility of extending some recognition or power to the original parties to work out normal commercial readjustments of the contract in the case of financing assignments even after the original obligor has been notified of the assignment.  This question is dealt with in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).</P>
<P>  6.  Subsection (5) recognizes that the non-assigning original party has a stake in the reliability of the person with whom he has closed the original contract, and is, therefore, entitled to due assurance that any delegated performance will be properly forthcoming.</P>
<P>  7.  This section is not intended as a complete statement of the law of delegation and assignment but is limited to clarifying a few points doubtful under the case law.  Particularly, neither this section nor this Article touches directly on such questions as the need or effect of notice of the assignment, the rights of successive assignees, or any question of the form of an assignment, either as between the parties or as against any third parties.  Some of these questions are dealt with in Article 9.</P>
