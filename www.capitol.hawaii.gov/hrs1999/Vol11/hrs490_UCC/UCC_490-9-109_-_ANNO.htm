<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  None.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  This Section classifies goods as consumer goods, equipment, farm products and inventory.  The classification is important in many situations it is relevant, for example, in determining the rights of persons who buy from a debtor goods subject to a security interest (Section 9-307), in certain questions of priority (Section 9-312), in determining the place of filing (Section 9-401) and in working out rights after default (Part 5).  Comment 5 to Section 9-102 contains an index of the special rules applicable to different classes of collateral.</P>
<P>  2.  The classes of goods are mutually exclusive; the same property cannot at the same time and as to the same person be both equipment and inventory, for example.  In borderline cases - a physician's car or a farmer's jeep which might be either consumer goods or equipment - the principal use to which the property is put should be considered as determinative.  Goods can fall into different classes at different times; a radio is inventory in the hands of a dealer and consumer goods in the hands of a householder.</P>
<P>  3.  The principal test to determine whether goods are inventory is that they are held for immediate or ultimate sale.  Implicit in the definition is the criterion that the prospective sale is in the ordinary course of business.  Machinery used in manufacturing, for example, is equipment and not inventory even though it is the continuing policy of the enterprise to sell machinery when it becomes obsolete.  Goods to be furnished under a contract of service are inventory even though the arrangement under which they are furnished is not technically a sale.  When an enterprise is engaged in the business of leasing a stock of products to users (for example, the fleet of cars owned by a car rental agency), that stock is also included within the definition of "inventory".  It should be noted that one class of goods which is not held for disposition to a purchaser or user is included in inventory:  "Materials used or consumed in a business".  Examples of this class of inventory are fuel to be used in operations, scrap metal produced in the course of manufacture, and containers to be used to package the goods.  In general it may be said that goods used in a business are equipment when they are fixed assets or have, as identifiable units, a relatively long period of use; but are inventory, even though not held for sale, if they are used up or consumed in a short period of time in the production of some end product.</P>
<P>  4.  Goods are "farm products" only if they are in the possession of a debtor engaged in farming operations.  Animals in a herd of livestock are covered whether they are acquired by purchase or result from natural increase.  Products of crops or livestock remain farm products so long as they are in the possession of a debtor engaged in farming operations and have not been subjected to a manufacturing process.  The terms "crops", "livestock" and "farming operations" are not defined; however, it is obvious from the text that "farming operations" includes raising livestock as well as crops; similarly, since eggs are products of livestock, livestock includes fowl.</P>
<P>  When crops or livestock or their products come into the possession of a person not engaged in farming operations they cease to be "farm products".  If they come into the possession of a marketing agency for sale or distribution or of a manufacturer or processor as raw materials, they become inventory.</P>
<P>  Products of crops or livestock, even though they remain in the possession of a person engaged in farming operations, lose their status as farm products if they are subjected to a manufacturing process.  What is and what is not a manufacturing operation is not determined by this Article.  At one end of the scale some processes are so closely connected with farming - such as pasteurizing milk or boiling sap to produce maple syrup or maple sugar - that they would not rank as manufacturing.  On the other hand an extensive canning operation would be manufacturing.  The line is one for the courts to draw.  After farm products have been subjected to a manufacturing operation, they become inventory if held for sale.</P>
<P>  Note that the buyer in ordinary course who under Section 9-307 takes free of a security interest in goods held for sale does not include one who buys farm products from a person engaged in farming operations.</P>
<P>  5.  The principal definition of equipment is a negative one:  goods used in a business (including farming or a profession) which are not inventory and not farm products.  Trucks, rolling stock, tools, machinery are typical.  It will be noted furthermore that any goods which are not covered by one of the other definitions in this section are to be treated as equipment.</P>
