</B><P>  This Article deals with a class of commercial paper representing commodities in storage or transportation.  This "commodity paper" is to be distinguished from what might be called "money paper" dealt with in the Article of this Act on Commercial Paper (Article 3) and "investment paper" dealt with in the Article of this Act on Investment Securities (Article 8).  The class of "commodity paper" is designated "document of title" following the terminology of the Uniform Sales Act Section 76.  Section 1-201.  The distinctions between negotiable and nonnegotiable documents in this section makes the most important subclassification employed in the Article, in that the holder of negotiable documents may acquire more rights than his transferor had (See Section 7-502).</P>
<P>  A document of title is negotiable only if it satisfies this section.  "Deliverable on proper indorsement and surrender of this receipt" will not render a document negotiable.  Bailees often include such provisions as a means of insuring return of nonnegotiable receipts for record purposes.  Such language may be regarded as insistence by the bailee upon a particular kind of receipt in connection with delivery of the goods.  Subsections (1)(a) and (2) make it clear that a document is not negotiable which provides for delivery to order or bearer only if written instructions to that effect are given by a named person.</P>
