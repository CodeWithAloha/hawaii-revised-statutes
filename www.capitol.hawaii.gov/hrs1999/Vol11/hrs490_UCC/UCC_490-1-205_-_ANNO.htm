<P>  <B>Prior</B> <B>Uniform</B> <B>Statutory</B> <B>Provision:</B>  No such general provision but see Sections 9(1), 15(5), 18(2), and 71, Uniform Sales Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</B>  This section makes it clear that:</P>
<P>  1.  This Act rejects both the "lay-dictionary" and the "conveyancer's" reading of a commercial agreement.  Instead the meaning of the agreement of the parties is to be determined by the language used by them and by their action, read and interpreted in the light of commercial practices and other surrounding circumstances.  The measure and background for interpretation are set by the commercial context, which may explain and supplement even the language of a formal or final writing.</P>
<P>  2.  Course of dealing under subsection (1) is restricted, literally, to a sequence of conduct between the parties previous to the agreement.  However, the provisions of the Act on course of performance make it clear that a sequence of conduct after or under the agreement may have equivalent meaning.  (Section 2-208.)</P>
<P>  3.  "Course of dealing" may enter the agreement either by explicit provisions of the agreement or by tacit recognition.</P>
<P>  4.  This Act deals with "usage of trade" as a factor in reaching the commercial meaning of the agreement which the parties have made.  The language used is to be interpreted as meaning what it may fairly be expected to mean to parties involved in the particular commercial transaction in a given locality or in a given vocation or trade.  By adopting in this context the term "usage of trade" this Act expresses its intent to reject those cases which see evidence of "custom" as representing an effort to displace or negate "established rules of law".  A distinction is to be drawn between mandatory rules of law such as the Statute of Frauds provisions of Article 2 on Sales whose very office is to control and restrict the actions of the parties, and which cannot be abrogated by agreement, or by a usage of trade, and those rules of law (such as those in Part 3 of Article 2 on Sales) which fill in points which the parties have not considered and in fact agreed upon.  The latter rules hold "unless otherwise agreed" but yield to the contrary agreement of the parties.  Part of the agreement of the parties to which such rules yield is to be sought for in the usages of trade which furnish the background and give particular meaning to the language used, and are the framework of common understanding controlling any general rules of law which hold only when there is no such understanding.</P>
<P>  5.  A usage of trade under subsection (2) must have the "regularity of observance" specified.  The ancient English tests for "custom" are abandoned in this connection.  Therefore, it is not required that a usage of trade be "ancient or immemorial", "universal" or the like.  Under the requirement of subsection (2) full recognition is thus available for new usages and for usages currently observed by the great majority of decent dealers, even though dissidents ready to cut corners do not agree.  There is room also for proper recognition of usage agreed upon by merchants in trade codes.</P>
<P>  6.  The policy of this Act controlling explicit unconscionable contracts and clauses (Sections 1-203, 2-302) applies to implicit clauses which rest on usage of trade and carries forward the policy underlying the ancient requirement that a custom or usage must be "reasonable".  However, the emphasis is shifted.  The very fact of commercial acceptance makes out a prima facie case that the usage is reasonable, and the burden is no longer on the usage to establish itself as being reasonable.  But the anciently established policing of usage by the courts is continued to the extent necessary to cope with the situation arising if an unconscionable or dishonest practice should become standard.</P>
<P>  7.  Subsection (3), giving the prescribed effect to usages of which the parties "are or should be aware", reinforces the provision of subsection (2) requiring not universality but only the described "regularity of observance" of the practice or method.  This subsection also reinforces the point of subsection (2) that such usages may be either general to trade or particular to a special branch of trade.</P>
<P>  8.  Although the terms in which this Act defines "agreement" include the elements of course of dealing and usage of trade, the fact that express reference is made in some sections to those elements is not to be construed as carrying a contrary intent or implication elsewhere.  Compare Section 1-102(4).</P>
<P>  9.  In cases of a well established line of usage varying from the general rules of this Act where the precise amount of the variation has not been worked out into a single standard, the party relying on the usage is entitled, in any event, to the minimum variation demonstrated.  The whole is not to be disregarded because no particular line of detail has been established.  In case a dominant pattern has been fairly evidenced, the party relying on the usage is entitled under this section to go to the trier of fact on the question of whether such dominant pattern has been incorporated into the agreement.</P>
<P>  10.  Subsection (6) is intended to insure that this Act's liberal recognition of the needs of commerce in regard to usage of trade shall not be made into an instrument of abuse.</P>

<P>  Trade usages are not automatically binding; the party sought to be bound must have reason to know of the usage.  577 F.2d 568.</P>
<P>  Applicable trade for purposes of trade usages; incorporation of practice of price protection as trade usage; parties can be bound by usage common to the place they are in business, even if it is not the usage of their particular vocation or trade; trade usage to price protect buyers could reasonably be construed as consistent with express term of seller's posted price at delivery.  664 F.2d 772.</P>
