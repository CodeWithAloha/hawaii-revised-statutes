<P>  <B>Prior</B> <B>Statutory</B> <B>Uniform</B> <B>Provision:</B>  Section 4, Uniform Sales Act (which was based on Section 17 of the Statute of 29 Charles II).</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  Completely rewritten by this and other sections.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</B>  To fill the gap left by the Statute of Frauds provisions for goods (Section 2-201), securities (Section 8-319), and security interests (Section 9-203).  The Uniform Sales Act covered the sale of "choses in action"; the principal gap relates to sale of the "general intangibles" defined in Article 9 (Section 9-106) and to transactions excluded from Article 9 by Section 9-104.  Typical are the sale of bilateral contracts, royalty rights or the like.  The informality normal to such transactions is recognized by lifting the limit for oral transactions to $5,000.  In such transactions there is often no standard of practice by which to judge, and values can rise or drop without warning; troubling abuses are avoided when the dollar limit is exceeded by requiring that the subject-matter be reasonably identified in a signed writing which indicates that a contract for sale has been made at a defined or stated price.</P>
