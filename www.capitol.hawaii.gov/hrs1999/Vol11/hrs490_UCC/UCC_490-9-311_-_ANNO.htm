<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  1.  To make clear that in all security transactions under this Article, the debtor has an interest (whether legal title or an equity) which he can dispose of and which his creditors can reach.</P>
<P>  2.  Some jurisdictions have held that when a mortgagee or conditional seller has "title" to the collateral, creditors may not proceed against the mortgagor's or vendee's interest by levy, attachment or other judicial process.  This Section changes those rules by providing that in all security interests the debtor's interest in the collateral remains subject to claims of creditors who take appropriate action.  It is left to the law of each state to determine the form of "appropriate process".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  3.  Where the security interest is in inventory, difficult problems arise with reference to attachment and levy.  Assume that a debt of $100,000 is secured by inventory worth twice that amount.  If by attachment or levy certain units of the inventory are seized, the determination of the debtor's equity in the units seized is not a simple matter.  The Section leaves the solution of this problem to the courts.  Procedures such as marshalling may be appropriate.</P>
