<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  The increased use of acceleration clauses either in the case of sales on credit or in time paper or in security transactions has led to some confusion in the cases as to the effect to be given to a clause which seemingly grants the power of an acceleration at the whim and caprice of one party.  This Section is intended to make clear that despite language which can be so construed and which further might be held to make the agreement void as against public policy or to make the contract illusory or too indefinite for enforcement, the clause means that the option is to be exercised only in the good faith belief that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired.</P>
<P>  Obviously this section has no application to demand instruments or obligations whose very nature permits call at any time with or without reason.  This section applies only to an agreement or to paper which in the first instance is payable at a future date.</P>
