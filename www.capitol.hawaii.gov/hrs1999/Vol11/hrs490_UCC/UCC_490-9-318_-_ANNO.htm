<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 9(3), Uniform Trust Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  Subsection (1) makes no substantial change in prior law.  An assignee has traditionally been subject to defenses or set- offs existing before an account debtor is notified of the assignment.  When the account debtor's defenses on an assigned account, chattel paper or a contract right arise from the contract between him and the assignor it makes no difference whether the breach giving rise to the defense occurs before or after the account debtor is notified of the assignment (subsection (1)(a)).  The account debtor may also have claims against the assignor which arise independently of that contract:  an assignee is subject to all such claims which accrue before, and free of all those which accrue after, the account debtor is notified (subsection (1)(b)).  The account debtor may waive his right to assert claims or defenses against an assignee to the extent provided in Section 9-206.</P>
<P>  2.  "Contract rights" as defined in Section 9-106 are in general rights to payments of money to be earned under an existing contract.  Prior law was in confusion as to whether modification of an executory contract by account debtor and assignor without the assignee's consent was possible after notification of an assignment.  Subsection (2) makes good faith modifications by assignor and account debtor without the assignee's consent effective against the assignee even after notification.  This rule may do some violence to accepted doctrines of contract law.  Nevertheless it is a sound and indeed a necessary rule in view of the realities of large scale procurement.  When for example it becomes necessary for a government agency to cut back or modify existing contracts, comparable arrangements must be made promptly in hundreds and even thousands of subcontracts lying in many tiers below the prime contract.  Typically the right to payments under these subcontracts will have been assigned.  The government, as sovereign, might have the right to amend or terminate existing contracts apart from statute.  This subsection gives the prime contractor (the account debtor) the right to make the required arrangements directly with his subcontractors without undertaking the task of procuring assents from the many banks to whom rights under the contracts may have been assigned.  Assignees are protected by the provision which gives them automatically corresponding rights under the modified or substituted contract.  Notice that subsection (2) applies only "so far as the right to payment under an assigned contract right has not already become an account," and therefore its application ends entirely when the work is done or the goods furnished.</P>
<P>  3.  Subsection (3) clarifies the right of an account debtor to make payment to his seller-assignor in an "indirect collection" situation (see Comment to Section 9-308).  So long as the assignee permits the assignor to collect accounts or leaves him in possession of chattel paper which does not indicate that payment is to be made at some place other than the assignor's place of business, the account debtor may pay the assignor even though he may know of the assignment.  In such a situation an assignee who wants to take over collections must notify the account debtor to make further payments to him.</P>
<P>  4.  Subsection (4) breaks sharply with the older contract doctrines by denying effectiveness to contractual terms prohibiting assignment of accounts and contract rights - that is, sums due and to become due under contracts of sale, construction contracts and the like.  Under the rule as stated an assignment would be effective even if made to an assignee who took with full knowledge that the account debtor had sought to prohibit or restrict assignment of the account or of the money to be earned under the contract.</P>
<P>  It is only for the past hundred years that our law has recognized the possibility of assigning choses in action.  The history of this development, at law and equity, is in broad outline well known.  Lingering traces of the absolute common law prohibition have survived almost to our own day.</P>
<P>  There can be no doubt that a term prohibiting assignment of proceeds was effective against an assignee with notice through the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth.  Section 151 of the Restatement of Contracts (1932) so states the law without qualification.</P>
<P>  That rule of law has been progressively undermined by a process of erosion which began much earlier than the cited section of the Restatement of Contracts would suggest.  The cases are legion in which courts have construed the heart out of prohibitory or restrictive terms and held the assignment good.  The cases are not lacking where courts have flatly held assignments valid without bothering to construe away the prohibition.  See 4 Corbin on Contracts (1951) §§872, 873.  Such cases as Allhusen v. Caristo Const. Corp., 303 N.Y. 446, 103 N.E.2d 891 (1952), would be rejected by this subsection.</P>
<P>  This gradual and largely unacknowledged shift in legal doctrine has taken place in response to economic need as accounts and contract rights have become the collateral which secures an ever increasing number of financing transactions, it has been necessary to reshape the law so that these intangibles, like negotiable instruments and negotiable documents of title, can be freely assigned.</P>
<P>  Subsection (4) thus states a rule of law which is widely recognized in the cases and which corresponds to current business practices.  It can be regarded as a revolutionary departure only by those who still cherish the hope that we may yet return to the views entertained some two hundred years ago by the Court of King's Bench.</P>
<P>  5.  The Federal Assignment of Claims Act of 1940 - to which of course this section is subject - requires that assignments of claims against the United States be filed as provided in that Act.  Many large business enterprises, situated like the United States in that claims against them are held by hundreds or thousands of subcontractors or suppliers, often require in their contract or purchase order forms that assignments against them be filed in a prescribed way.  Subsection (3) requires reasonable identification of the account or contract right assigned and recognizes the right of an account debtor to require reasonable proof of the making of the assignment and to that extent validates such requirements in contracts or purchase order forms.  If the notification does not contain such reasonable identification or if such reasonable proof is not furnished on request the account debtor may disregard the assignment and make payment to the assignor.  What is "reasonable" is not left to the arbitrary decision of the account debtor; if there is doubt as to the adequacy either of a notification or of proof submitted after request, the account debtor may not be safe in disregarding it unless he has notified the assignee with commercial promptness as to the respects in which identification or proof is considered defective.</P>
<P>  6.  If the thing to be assigned is the beneficiary's right under a letter of credit, Section 5-116 should be consulted.</P>
