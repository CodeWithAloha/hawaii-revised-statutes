<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  The principal limitation on the secured party's right to dispose of collateral is the requirement that he proceed in good faith (Section 1-203) and in a commercially reasonable manner.  See Section 9-504.  In the case where he proceeds, or is about to proceed, in a contrary manner, it is vital both to the debtor and other creditors to provide a remedy for the failure to comply with the statutory duty.  This remedy will be of particular importance when it is applied prospectively before the unreasonable disposition has been concluded.  This Section therefore provides that a secured party proposing to dispose of collateral in an unreasonable manner, may, by court order, be restrained from doing so, and such an order might appropriately provide either that he proceed with the sale or other disposition under specified terms and conditions, or that the sale be made by a representative of creditors where insolvency proceedings have been instituted.  The Section further provides for damages where the unreasonable disposition has been concluded, and, in the case of consumer goods, states a minimum recovery.</P>
<P>  A case may be put in which the liquidation value of an insolvent estate would be enhanced by disposing of all the debtor's property (including that subject to a security interest) in the liquidation proceeding and in which, if a secured party repossesses and sells that part of the property which he holds as collateral, the remainder will have little or no resale value.  In such a case the question may arise whether a particular court has the power to control the manner of disposition, although reasonable in other respects, in order to preserve the estate for the benefit of creditors.  Such a power is no doubt inherent in a Federal bankruptcy court, and perhaps also in other courts of equity administering insolvent estates.  Traditionally it has not been exercised where the secured party claimed under a title retention device, such as conditional sale or trust receipt.  See In re Lake's Laundry, Inc., 79 F.2d 326 (2d Cir. 1935) and the remarks of Clark, J., concurring, in In re White Plains Ice Service, Inc., 109 F.2d 913 (2d Cir. 1940).  But since this Article adopts neither a "title" nor a "lien" theory of security interests (see Section 9-202 and Comment thereto), the granting or denying of, for example, petitions of reclamation in bankruptcy proceedings should not be influenced by speculations as to whether the secured party had "title" to the collateral or "merely a lien".</P>
<P>  2.  In view of the remedies provided the debtor and other creditors in subsection (1) when a secured party does not dispose of collateral in a commercially reasonable manner, it is of great importance to make clear what types of disposition are to be considered commercially reasonable, and in an appropriate case to give the secured party means of getting, by court order or negotiation with a creditors' committee or a representative of creditors, approval of a proposed method of disposition as a commercially reasonable one.  Subsection (2) states rules to assist in the determination, and provides for such advance approval in appropriate situations.  One recognized method of disposing of repossessed collateral is for the secured party to sell the collateral to or through a dealer - a method which in the long run may realize better average returns since the secured party does not usually maintain his own facilities for making such sales.  Such a method of sale, fairly conducted, is recognized as commercially reasonable under the second sentence of subsection (2).  However, none of the specific methods of disposition set forth in subsection (2) is to be regarded as either required or exclusive, provided only that the disposition made or about to be made by the secured party is commercially reasonable.</P>
