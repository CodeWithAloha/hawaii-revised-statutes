<P>  <B>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</B>  Section 11, Uniform Trust Receipts Act.</P>
<P>  <B>Changes:</B>  None in substance.</P>
<P>  <B>Purposes:</P>
</B><P>  1.  To provide that liens securing claims arising from work intended to enhance or preserve the value of the collateral take priority over an earlier security interest even though perfected.</P>
<P>  2.  Apart from the Uniform Trust Receipts Act which had a section similar to this one, there was generally no specific statutory rule as to priority between security devices and liens for services or materials.  Under chattel mortgage or conditional sales law many decisions made the priority of such liens turn on whether the secured party did or did not have "title".  This Section changes such rules and makes the lien for services or materials prior in all cases where they are furnished in the ordinary course of the lienor's business and the goods involved are in the lienor's possession.  Some of the statutes creating such liens expressly make the lien subordinate to a prior security interest.  This Section does not repeal such statutory provisions.  If the statute creating the lien is silent, even though it has been construed by decision to make the lien subordinate to the security interest, this Section provides a rule of interpretation that the lien should take priority over the security interest.</P>
