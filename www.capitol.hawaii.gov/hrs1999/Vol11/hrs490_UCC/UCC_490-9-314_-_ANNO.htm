<P>  2.  This Section changes prior law in that the secured party claiming an interest in a part (e.g., a new motor in an old car) is entitled to priority and has a right to remove even though under other rules of law the part now belongs to the whole.  The Section adopts the same policy as that stated in Section 9-313 for fixtures.</P>
<P>  3.  This Section does not apply to goods which, for example, are so commingled in a manufacturing process that their original identity is lost.  That type of situation is covered in Section 9-315.  Section 9-315 should also be consulted for the effect of a financing statement which claims both component parts and the resulting product.</P>
