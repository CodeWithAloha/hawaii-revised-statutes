<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§490:9-402.5]  Financing statements covering consigned or leased goods.</B>  A consignor or lessor of goods may file a financing statement using the terms "consignor," "consignee," "lessor," "lessee" or the like instead of the terms specified in section 490:9-402.  The provisions of this part shall apply as appropriate to such financing statement but its filing shall not of itself be a factor in determining whether or not the consignment or lease is intended as security (section 490:1-201(37)).  However, if it is determined for other reasons that the consignment or lease is so intended, a security interest of the consignor or lessor which attaches to the consigned or leased goods is perfected by such filing. [L 1982, c 12, §1]</P>
