The governor has approved and forwarded to the Navy a community reuse plan for these lands.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  [1998 amendment effective January 1, 1999.]  The legislature hereby designates these lands to be received by the State as the "Kalaeloa community development district" and the harbor known as Barbers Point harbor as Kalaeloa Barbers Point harbor, in recognition of the traditional Hawaiian name for the area, which means "long point".
