<P>&#9;(b)  The medical services excise tax credit shall be six per cent of the nursing facilities expenses paid by or for the resident individual during the taxable year.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  For the purposes of this section "nursing facility expenses" are amounts actually paid by the taxpayer for services provided to the taxpayer or to any individual who bears a relationship to the taxpayer as described in section 152(a) (with respect to dependent defined) of the Internal Revenue Code by a nursing facility licensed under section 321<B>-</B>9 and 321<B>-</B>11 and any intermediate care facility for mentally retarded persons under sections 321<B>-</B>9 and 321<B>-</B>11; provided that the nursing facility expense was subject to the imposition and payment of the tax imposed by chapter 346E.</P>
<P>&#9;The amount of nursing facility expenses paid during the taxable year shall not be reduced by any insurance reimbursement.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The tax credits claimed by a resident taxpayer pursuant to this section shall be deductible from the resident taxpayer's individual income tax liability, if any, for the tax year in which they are properly claimed.  If the tax credits claimed by a resident taxpayer exceed the amount of income tax payment due from the resident taxpayer, the excess of credits over payments due shall be refunded to the resident taxpayer; provided that tax credits properly claimed by a resident individual who has no income tax liability shall be paid to the resident individual; and provided further that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credits allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The director of taxation shall prepare such forms as may be necessary to claim a credit under this section.  The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish reasonable information in order that the director may ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and the director may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  All claims for tax credits under this section, including any amended claims, must be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credits may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  This section shall not be effective after June&nbsp;30, 1997. [L 1989, c 321, §1; am L 1991, c 217, §1; am L 1992, c 235, §§4, 5; am L 1993, c 220, §1 and c 315, §§3, 4; am L 1995, c 134, §2 as superseded by L Sp 1995, c 23, §§1, 2]</P>
