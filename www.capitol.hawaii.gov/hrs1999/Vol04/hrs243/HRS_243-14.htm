No proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of the taxes or the enforcement of the liability shall begin after the expiration of the three-year period.

<P>&#9;(c)  In the case of a false or fraudulent statement with intent to evade tax or liability, or of a failure to file a statement, the tax or liability may be assessed or levied at any time; provided that in the case of a statement claimed to be false or fraudulent with intent to evade tax or liability, the determination as to the claim shall first be made by a judge of the circuit court as provided in section 235<B>-</B>111(c) which shall apply to the tax imposed by this chapter.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the assessment, levy, and collection of the tax or liability, both the department and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment or levy after the expiration date, the tax or liability may be assessed or levied, or the overpayment, if any, may be credited at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon.  The period agreed upon may be extended by a subsequent agreement in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
