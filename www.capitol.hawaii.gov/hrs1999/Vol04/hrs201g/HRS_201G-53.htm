The corporation shall give written notice to the person concerned specifying the reason for which the eviction is proposed and fixing the date and place of hearing.  The notice shall be given at least five days before the date set for the hearing.  At the hearing, before final action is taken, the person concerned shall be entitled to be heard in person or through counsel, and shall be accorded a full and fair hearing.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Hearings shall be conducted by a trial examiner or board appointed by the corporation.  The board shall consist of not less than three persons.  Trial examiners or members of the board may be contract hires or employees of the corporation.  At least one trial examiner or board, hereinafter called the hearing examiners, shall be established in each county of the State.  The findings, conclusions, decision, and order of the hearing examiners shall be final unless an appeal is taken as hereinafter provided.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The hearing examiners shall have the same powers respecting administering oaths, compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence, and examining witnesses, as are possessed by circuit courts.  In case of disobedience by any person of any order of the hearing examiners, or of any subpoena issued by them, or the refusal of any witness to testify to any matter regarding which the witness may lawfully be questioned, any circuit judge, on application by the hearing examiners, shall compel obedience as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued by a circuit court, or a refusal to testify therein.
