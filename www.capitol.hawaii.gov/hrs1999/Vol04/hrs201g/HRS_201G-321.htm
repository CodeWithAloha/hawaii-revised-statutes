<P>&#9;<B>[§201G-321]  Downpayment loans.</B>  (a)  The corporation may make direct downpayment loans to eligible borrowers.  The downpayment loan to any borrower shall not exceed thirty per cent of the purchase price of the residential property or $15,000, whichever is less.  The interest rate on the loans may range from zero per cent to eight per cent, depending on the buyer's incomes.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The repayment of every downpayment loan shall be secured by a duly recorded second mortgage executed by the borrower to the State on the residential property purchased with the downpayment loan.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The principal of the downpayment loan, together with accrued interest, shall be due and payable upon the sale, transfer, or refinancing of the home, or shall be repaid by the borrower in such installments as determined by the corporation; provided that the corporation may provide a period in which the payment could be waived.  The period over which the principal and interest shall be paid need not coincide with the period over which the loan from the mortgage lender for the balance of the purchase price must be repaid.  The borrower may repay the whole or any part of the unpaid balance of the downpayment loan, plus accrued interest at any time without penalty.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The corporation may secure the services of the mortgage lender who loans to the borrower the balance of the purchase price of the residential property or the services of any other mortgage lender doing business in the State to collect, on behalf of the State, the principal and interest of the downpayment loan and otherwise to service the downpayment loan, for a servicing fee not in excess of the prevailing loan servicing fees.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The corporation shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to carry out the purposes of this subpart. [L 1997, c 350, pt of §2]</P>
