In addition, the director of taxation shall have the exclusive rights and power to determine the county or counties in which a person is engaged in business and, in the case of a person engaged in business in more than one county, the director shall determine through apportionment or other means, that portion of the general excise and use tax surcharge attributable to business conducted in each county.</P>
