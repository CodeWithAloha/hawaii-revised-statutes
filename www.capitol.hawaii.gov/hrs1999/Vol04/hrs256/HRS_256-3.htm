<P>&#9;(e)  The director of finance may select more than one financial organization and investment instrument for the program when the Internal Revenue Service has provided guidance that giving a contributor the choice of two or more investment instruments under a state program will not cause the program to fail to qualify for favorable tax treatment under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or successor legislation.</P>
