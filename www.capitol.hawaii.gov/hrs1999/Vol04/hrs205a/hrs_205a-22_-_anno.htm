<P>  "Development" includes that which is planned.  4 H. App. 304, 666 P.2d 177.</P>
<P>  Where no express procedure provided in Maui charter or Maui special management area rules for appeal of Maui planning director’s decision on a minor permit application to the Maui planning commission, and commission delegated authority to render final decision on minor permit applications to director pursuant to this section, director’s decision not to process developer’s application was a final decision equivalent to a denial of the application and was thus appealable under §91-14(a).  88 H. 108, 962 P.2d 367.</P>
<P>  Where defendant’s tour boat operation changed the intensity of use of water in the Hanalei special management area, defendant’s tour boat operation constituted a "development", within the meaning of  this section, that was not exempt from the coastal zone management act or special management area rules.  89 H. 400, 974 P.2d 40.</P>
