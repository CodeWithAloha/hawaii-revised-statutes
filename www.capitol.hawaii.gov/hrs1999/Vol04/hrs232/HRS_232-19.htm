The appeal shall be considered and treated for all purposes as a general appeal and shall bring up for determination all questions of fact and all questions of law, including constitutional questions, involved in the appeal.  A notice of appeal may be amended at any time up to the final determination of the tax liability by the last court which an appeal may be taken.  The supreme court shall enter a judgment in conformity with its opinion or decision. </P>
