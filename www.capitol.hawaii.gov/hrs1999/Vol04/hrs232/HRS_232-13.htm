<B><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;§232-13  Hearing de novo; bill of particulars.</B>  The hearing before the tax appeal court shall be a hearing de novo.  Irrespective of which party prevails in proceedings before a state board of review, or any equivalent administrative body established by county ordinance, the assessment as made by the assessor, or if increased by the board, or equivalent county administrative body, the assessment as so increased, shall be deemed prima facie correct.  Each party shall have the right to introduce, or the tax appeal court, of its own motion, may require the taking of such evidence in relation to the subject pending as in the court's discretion may be deemed proper.  The court, in the manner provided in section 232<B>-</B>16, shall determine all questions of fact and all questions of law, including constitutional questions, involved in the appeal.</P>
<P>&#9;The jurisdiction of the tax appeal court is limited to the amount of valuation or taxes, as the case may be, in dispute as shown on the one hand by the amount claimed by the taxpayer or county and on the other hand by the amount of the assessment, or if increased by the board, or equivalent county administrative body, the assessment as so increased.</P>
<P>&#9;Assessments for the same year upon other similar property situated in the State shall be receivable in evidence upon the hearing.</P>
<P>&#9;Upon the application of either the taxpayer, the county, or the assessor, the judge of the tax appeal court, upon notice, may allow and direct a bill of particulars of the claim of either the taxpayer, the county, or the assessor to be delivered to the other, and in case of default the judge shall preclude the person so defaulting from giving evidence of the part or parts of the person's affirmative claim of which particulars have not been delivered.
