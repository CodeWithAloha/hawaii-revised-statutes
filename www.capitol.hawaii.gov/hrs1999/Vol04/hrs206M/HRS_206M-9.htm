<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>[§206M-9]  Bonds; bond anticipation notes.</B>  (a)  The development corporation, with the approval of the governor, may issue bonds for each single project or industrial park or multi- project program which has been authorized by the legislature by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members to which each house is entitled; provided that the legislature shall find that the issuance of such bonds is in the public interest.  Bonds shall be issued in such principal amounts as may be authorized from time to time by law and at such time or times as the development corporation deems necessary and advisable to finance the cost of a project or industrial park as authorized by law.  The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such bonds shall be payable:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Exclusively from the revenues and receipts derived or to be derived by the development corporation under project agreements or from such revenues and receipts together with any grant from the government in aid of the project or industrial park financed from the proceeds of such bonds;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Exclusively from the revenues and receipts derived or to be derived by the development corporation from a particular project agreement, whether or not the project or industrial park to which it relates is financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of the bonds; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;From revenues and receipts derived or to be derived by the development corporation generally.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;Neither the board members nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Bonds issued pursuant to this chapter may be in one or more issues and in one or more series within an issue and shall be further authorized pursuant to resolution of the board.  The bonds shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, shall have such rank or priority, and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the development corporation, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, all as may be determined by the development corporation.</P>
<P>&#9;The development corporation shall determine the form of the bonds, including interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and, subject to the approval of the state director of finance the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company approved by the state director of finance within or without the State.</P>
<P>&#9;The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the development corporation may determine, and provisions may be made for the registration of coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of bonds registered as to both principal and interest.  Subject to the approval of the state director of finance the development corporation may sell bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the development corporation may issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Should any bond issued under this chapter or any coupon appertaining thereto become mutilated, lost, stolen, or destroyed, the development corporation may cause a new bond or coupon of like date, number, and tenor to be executed and delivered in exchange and substitution for, and upon the cancellation of such mutilated bond or coupon, or in lieu of and in substitution for such lost, stolen, or destroyed bond or coupon.  Such new bond or coupon shall not be executed or delivered until the holder of the mutilated, lost, stolen, or destroyed bond or coupon (1) has paid the reasonable expenses and charges in connection therewith, (2) in the case of a lost, stolen, or destroyed bond or coupon, has filed with the development corporation or its fiduciary evidence satisfactory to the development corporation or its fiduciary that such bond or coupon was lost, stolen, or destroyed and that the holder was the owner thereof, and (3) has furnished indemnity satisfactory to the development corporation.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  The development corporation in its discretion may provide that CUSIP identification numbers shall be printed on such bonds.  If such numbers are imprinted on such bonds (1) no such number shall constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the particular bond upon which it is imprinted, and (2) no liability shall attach to the development corporation or any officer or agent thereof, including any fiscal agent, paying agent, or registrar for such bonds by reason of such numbers or any use made thereof, including any use thereof made by the development corporation, any such officer, or any such agent, or by reason of any inaccuracy, error, or omission with respect thereto or in such use.  The development corporation in its discretion may require that all costs of obtaining and imprinting such numbers shall be paid by the purchaser of such bonds.  For the purposes of this subsection, the term "CUSIP identification numbers" means the numbering system adopted by the Committee for Uniform Security Identification Procedures formed by the Securities Industry Association.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Whenever the development corporation has authorized the issuance of bonds under this chapter, bond anticipation notes of the development corporation may be issued in anticipation of the issuance of such bonds and of the receipt of the proceeds of sale thereof, for the purposes for which such bonds have been authorized.  All bond anticipation notes shall be authorized by the development corporation, and the maximum principal amount of such notes shall not exceed the authorized principal amount of such bonds.  The notes shall be payable solely from and secured solely by the proceeds of sale of the bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued and the moneys, rates, charges, and other revenues from which would be payable and by which would be secured such bonds; provided that to the extent that the principal of the notes shall be paid from moneys other than the proceeds of sale of such bonds, the maximum amount of bonds that has been authorized in anticipation of which the notes are issued shall be reduced by the amount of notes paid in such manner.  The authorization, issuance, and the details of such notes shall be governed by this chapter with respect to bonds insofar as the same may be applicable; provided that each note, together with all renewals and extensions thereof, or refundings thereof by other notes issued under this subsection, shall mature within five years from the date of the original note.</P>
<P>&#9;(g)  In order to secure the payment of any of the bonds issued pursuant to this chapter, and interest thereon, or in connection with such bonds, the development corporation shall have the power as to such bonds:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;To pledge all or any part of the revenues and receipts derived or to be derived by the development corporation as provided in this chapter to the punctual payment of bonds and interest thereon, and to covenant against thereafter pledging such revenues and receipts to other bonds or other obligations of the development corporation for any other purpose, except as otherwise stated in the proceedings providing for the issuance of bonds permitting the issuance of additional bonds to be equally and ratably secured by a lien upon such moneys, rates, charges, and other revenues.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;To pledge and assign the interest of the development corporation under any project agreement and other agreements related to a project or industrial park, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the development corporation thereunder, including the right to receive revenues and receipts thereunder.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;To pledge or assign all or any part of the proceeds derived by the development corporation from proceeds of insurance or condemnation awards.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;To covenant as to the use and disposition of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;To covenant to set aside or pay over reserves and sinking funds for such bonds and as to the disposition thereof.</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;To covenant and prescribe as to what happenings or occurrences shall constitute "events of default", the terms and conditions upon which any or all of such bonds shall become or may be declared due before maturity, and as to the terms and conditions upon which such declaration and its consequences may be waived. </P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;To covenant as to the rights, liabilities, powers, and duties arising upon the breach by it of any covenant, condition, or obligation.</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;Subject to the approval of the state director of finance to designate a national or state bank or trust company within or without the State incorporated in the United States, to serve as trustee for the holders of the bonds and to enter into a trust indenture, trust agreement, or indenture of mortgage with such trustee.  The trustee may be authorized by the development corporation to receive and receipt for, hold, and administer the proceeds of such bonds and to apply the proceeds to the purposes for which such bonds are issued, or to receive and receipt for, hold, and administer the revenues and receipts derived or to be derived by the development corporation under a project agreement or other agreement related to a project or industrial park, and to apply such revenues and receipts to the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds, or both, and excess revenues and receipts to the payment of expenses incurred by the development corporation in administering such bonds or in carrying out such project agreement or other agreement.  If the trustee shall be appointed, any trust indenture, trust agreement, or indenture of mortgage entered into by the development corporation with the trustee may contain whatever covenants and provisions as may be necessary, convenient, or desirable in order to secure such bonds.  The development corporation may pledge and assign to the trustee a project agreement and other agreements related thereto and the rights of the development corporation thereunder, including the right to receive revenues and receipts thereunder.  The development corporation may appoint the trustee to serve as fiscal agent for the payment of the principal and interest, and for the purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption of the bonds, and may authorize and empower the trustee to perform such functions with respect to such payment, purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, as the development corporation may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient, including without limitation the holding of the bonds and coupons which have been paid and the supervision of the destruction thereof in accordance with law.</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;To execute all instruments necessary or convenient in the exercise of the powers herein granted or in the performance of its covenants and duties.</P>
<P>    (10)&#9;To invest or provide for the investment of the proceeds of bonds and revenues and receipts derived by the development corporation in such securities and in such manner as it deems proper.</P>
<P>    (11)&#9;To make such covenants and do any and all acts and things as may be necessary, convenient, or desirable in order to secure such bonds, notwithstanding that such covenants, acts, or things may not be enumerated in this chapter.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;No holder or holders of bonds issued under this chapter shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the State or any political subdivision of the State to pay such bonds or the interest thereon and no moneys other than the revenues pledged to such bonds shall be applied to the payment thereof.</P>
<P>&#9;(h)  Bonds bearing the signature or facsimile signature of officers in office on the date of the signing thereof shall be valid and sufficient for all purposes, notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof and payment therefor any or all the persons whose signatures appear thereon shall have ceased to be officers of the development corporation.  The bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this chapter which recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance.</P>
<P>&#9;(i)  Subject to authorization by an act enacted by the legislature by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members to which each house is entitled, the development corporation may issue bonds for the purpose of refunding bonds then outstanding and issued under this chapter whether or not such outstanding bonds have matured or are then subject to redemption.  The development corporation may issue bonds for the combined purposes of (1) financing or refinancing the cost of a project or industrial park, or the improvement or expansion thereof, and (2) refunding bonds which shall theretofore have been issued under this chapter and then shall be outstanding, whether or not such outstanding bonds have matured or then are subject to redemption.</P>
<P>&#9;Nothing in this subsection shall require or be deemed to require the development corporation to elect to redeem or prepay bonds being refunded, or to redeem or prepay bonds being refunded which were issued, in the form customarily known as term bonds in accordance with any sinking fund installment schedule specified in any proceeding authorizing the issuance thereof, or, if the development corporation elects to redeem or prepay such bonds, to redeem or prepay as of any particular date or dates.  The issuance of such bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights and remedies of the holders thereof, and the rights, powers, privileges, duties, and obligations of the development corporation with respect to the bonds, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this chapter insofar as the same may be applicable.
