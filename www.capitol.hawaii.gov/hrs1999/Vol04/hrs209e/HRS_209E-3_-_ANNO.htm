<P>  Department promulgated rules requiring initial survey and annual report from the participating county pursuant to its duty under paragraph (3).  If extending survey and reporting requirements to new enterprise zone (EZ) created by the legislature would result in an increase in the level of service under city and county's existing program, then, unless department was willing to share in the cost, city and county was not required to submit initial survey or annual report on new EZ.  Att. Gen. Op. 98-1.</P>
