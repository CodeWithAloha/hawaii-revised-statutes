</B>
<P>  The Code follows the lead of the Model Penal Code in providing two general sections for conduct which recklessly endangers human life.[1]  Previous Hawaii law covered, as does the law of most jurisdictions,[2] such cases of reckless endangering on an ad hoc basis.[3]  A quick perusal of such statutes reveals that they all have in common the reckless endangering of human life.  The Code obviates the need for special legislation on each dangerous instrument or act.  Rather, all conduct so endangering human life or limb is made a misdemeanor.</P>
<P>  The aggravated offense of reckless endangering in the first degree, §707-713, is reserved for cases where the actor employs "widely dangerous means."  Widely dangerous means, as defined in §708-800, are those means which are known to be capable of causing widespread damage or destruction to both life and property.  It is thought that where the potential for destruction is this great, the actor's dangerousness to society is increased so substantially, over the case where only a single or a few people are threatened, that the felony sanction is justified.</P>

<P>  Act 215, Session Laws 1978, added to §707-713(1) the words "or intentionally fires a firearm in a manner which places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury."  The legislature felt that the grave dangers posed by the use of a firearm justified a felony sanction.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 675-78, House Standing Committee Report No. 116.</P>
<P>  Act 285, Session Laws 1988, amended §707-713 for the purpose of limiting the offense, in regard to firearms, to a person who intentionally fires a firearm in a manner which recklessly places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1604-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2141.</P>
<P>  Act 62, Session Laws 1990, amended §707-714 to subject to misdemeanor liability, a person who creates an obvious risk to the public by intentionally discharging a firearm in areas likely to be traveled or inhabited.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3060.</P>
