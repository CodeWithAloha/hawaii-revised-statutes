</B>
<P>  Chapter not violated and pre-sentence report sufficiently complied with §706-602, where defendant asserted that court did not order or receive a pre-sentence correctional diagnosis and report as required by §706-601(1)(a), therefore, since the information required under §706-602 was not furnished to court for its consideration in imposing sentence, the sentences were not imposed in accordance with provisions of this chapter and were illegal.  10 H. App. 535, 880 P.2d 208.</P>
