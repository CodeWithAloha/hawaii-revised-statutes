<P>  Act 197, Session Laws 1990, amended this section to require the attorney general to prepare a report to the legislature on the use of the Hawaii omnibus criminal forfeiture act.  The legislature felt it was important to be kept well informed about the use of this powerful tool.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2900.</P>
<P>  Act 112, Session Laws 1992, amended this section to provide that the holder of the immediate reversionary interest in leasehold real property forfeited to the State under chapter 712A is to be offered the first opportunity to acquire the remaining leasehold interest and any improvements on the property built or paid for by the lessee.
