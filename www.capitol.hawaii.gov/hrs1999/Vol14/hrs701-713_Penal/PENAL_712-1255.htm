<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§712-1255  Conditional discharge.</B>  (1)  Whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any offense under this chapter or chapter 329 or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating to a dangerous drug, harmful drug, detrimental drug, or an intoxicating compound, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of promoting a dangerous drug, harmful drug, detrimental drug, or an intoxicating compound under section 712-1243, 712-1245, 712-1246, 712-1248, 712-1249, or 712-1250, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place the accused on probation upon terms and conditions.  Upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)  Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)  There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with respect to any person.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)  After conviction, for any offense under this chapter or chapter 329, but prior to sentencing, the court shall be advised by the prosecutor whether the conviction is defendant's first or a subsequent offense.  If it is not a first offense, the prosecutor shall file an information setting forth the prior convictions.  The defendant shall have the opportunity in open court to affirm or deny that the defendant is identical with the person previously convicted.  If the defendant denies the identity, sentence shall be postponed for such time as to permit the trial, before a jury if the defendant has a right to trial by jury and demands a jury, on the sole issue of the defendant's identity with the person previously convicted.
