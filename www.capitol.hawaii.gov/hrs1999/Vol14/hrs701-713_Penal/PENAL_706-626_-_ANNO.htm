</B>
<P>  The court, in order to control the conditions of suspension or probation, must have power, either by summons or warrant, to require the defendant to appear before the court.  Subsection (1) provides this power.  Subsection (2) provides a more limited power for probation and peace officers; they may arrest without a warrant only where there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has failed to comply with a condition of probation or suspension.</P>
<P>  Subsection (3) is addressed to the problem presented by a defendant who is on probation or under suspended sentence and who is accused or charged with commission of another crime.  The commission of a crime while on probation or under suspension of sentence would, in most cases, constitute a violation of a condition of probation or suspension.  The question thus presented is whether the issue of guilt, with respect to the most recent crime, should be tried informally as a violation of a condition of suspension or probation or whether the issue should be tried independently.  The Code resolves this question by providing that the defendant may be held pending an independent or formal determination by the court having jurisdiction over the charge, thus preserving for the defendant all procedural rights.  This subsection must be read in conjunction with §706-628(1) which provides for revocation in cases where the defendant "has been convicted of another crime." </P>
<P>  Subsection (1) is in substantial accord with prior law governing the circuit courts.[1]  Subsection (2) is an addition to the law and subsection (3) represents a slight departure from it.  The circuit court apparently had the power--although it may choose not to exercise it--to decide, in a probation proceeding, the issue of whether the defendant has committed a crime during the period of probation.[2]</P>

<P>  Subsection (3) should not be read to mean that statutes on probation are concerned only with offenses committed after a defendant is placed on probation.  Implications arising from this section and commentary cannot be used to define language of §706-628(1).  62 H. 159, 612 P.2d 1168.</P>

<P>  Under subsection (3), upon showing of probable cause court has discretionary authority to commit without bail.  1 H. App. 98, 614 P.2d 405.</P>
<P>  Motion to commit without bail pursuant to subsection (3) tolls the period of probation.  1 H. App. 469, 620 P.2d 1082.</P>
