</B>
<P>  This section restates prior law[1] and allows the court to increase or relax the conditions of probation.  Such power is essential if the disposition is to remain flexible.  However, if an increase in the severity of the conditions is proposed, the court must accord the defendant the procedural rights stated in §706-627.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-625</P>
</B>
<P>  Act 192, Session Laws 1985, amended this section and consolidated it with the law governing the revocation of probation or suspension of sentence, formerly contained in §706-628 and part of §706-627.  As a result, §706-628 is repealed.</P>
<P>  Act 45, Session Laws 1989, defined the word "conviction" as applied in the revocation or modification of probation conditions.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1282, House Standing Committee Report No. 844.</P>

</B>
<P>  Criteria for modification.  55 H. 632, 525 P.2d 1119.</P>
<P>  Mandated revocation of probation under certain circumstances is a means to compel a court to review defendant's original sentence in light of new facts.  Court may reimpose the same sentence.  69 H. 424, 744 P.2d 1208.</P>
<P>  Defendant was prejudiced because of inability to independently test urine samples.  70 H. 194, 767 P.2d 243.</P>
<P>  Court had discretion to consider factors other than defendant's wilfulness in determining whether failure to comply with probation condition was inexcusable under section.  73 H. 81, 829 P.2d 1325.</P>
<P>  Statutory language of subsection (e) (1992) must be harmonized with §706-671(2), mandating credit for time served in imprisonment.  78 H. 343, 893 P.2d 194.</P>
<P>  Court abused discretion in revoking defendant's probation where defendant made the monthly payments as condition of probation and there was no other justifiable cause for revocation.  79 H. 511, 904 P.2d 525.</P>
<P>  Court cannot revoke probation and impose new probation term.  6 H. App. 253, 718 P.2d 1117.</P>
<P>  Where defendant made conscious and wilful decision to fail to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of probation under paragraph (3), court did not abuse discretion in revoking probation and imposing sentence which may have been originally imposed.  82 H. 441 (App.), 922 P.2d 1054.</P>
<P>  Circuit court properly concluded that it was required to revoke defendant's probation pursuant to subsection (c) because of subsequent felony conviction.  83 H. 102 (App.), 924 P.2d 596.</P>
