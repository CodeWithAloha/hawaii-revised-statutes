</B>
<P>  Act 184, Session Laws 1983, added this section to require notification to a crime victim if a defendant who harmed the victim is released into the community after conviction.  This addition was intended to insure that crime victims "are treated with fairness and respect" and that agencies in the criminal justice system cooperate with each other to provide information and other help to crime victims.  House Conference Committee Report No. 46.</P>
<P>  Act 227, Session Laws 1985, amended this section so that:  (1) victims or surviving immediate family members of a deceased victim are notified whenever the offender is paroled or unconditionally released; and (2) in lieu of notifying a victim or surviving family member, the appropriate authorities may notify the witness or victim counselor programs in the county where the victim or a family member resides.  Under prior law, only the victim was notified of the parole or unconditional release.  House Conference Committee Report No. 5, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 4.</P>
<P>  Act 383, Session Laws 1997, amended this section by amending the definition of "surviving immediate family member" to include a reciprocal beneficiary.  The amendment establishes the status of reciprocal beneficiaries and provides certain state governmental benefits to those with that status.  Among the benefits extended to reciprocal beneficiaries which are substantially equivalent to those extended to spouses is legal standing relating to victims rights.  Conference Committee Report No. 2.</P>
