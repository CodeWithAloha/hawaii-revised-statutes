</B>
<P>  Act 149, Session Laws 1998, added this section to require that as a mandatory condition of probation and bail, defendants are to observe geographic restrictions prohibiting them from entering or walking on the public streets or sidewalks of Waikiki during the hours from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.  Defendants that live in Waikiki and choose to remain in Waikiki during the prohibited hours are required to stay off the streets and sidewalks during those hours.  The legislature believed that although the restriction covered a large physical space, it was narrowly tailored to cover only the hours most closely associated with the crime.  Also, the restriction was sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice of the behavior that is prohibited.  Act 149 also allowed the counties to enact ordinances regulating street solicitation that shall supersede the provisions of this section.  Conference Committee Report No. 83.</P>
