</B>
<P>  This section sets forth the procedure when the court has before it a motion in favor of sentencing the defendant to imprisonment for an extended term.  Fairness to the defendant demands that the defendant receive notice of the ground upon which an extended term is proposed and that the hearing focus on this issue.  In other respects the hearing will be the same as that provided for in cases involving the possibility of imprisonment within the ordinary limits.</P>
