</B>
<P>  These sections of the Code consolidate offenses previously classified as "assault", "battery", and "affray".[1]  Nonfatal bodily offenses against the person are termed assaults, and are graded according to the gravity of the harm or danger they represent.[2]</P>
<P>  Assault in the first degree, as defined in §707-710, is the most serious, combining the requirements of the most culpable states of mind with the most serious bodily injury, short of homicide.  Accordingly, assault in the first degree is made a class B felony, one class below murder.</P>
<P>  Assault in the second degree, as defined in §707-711, embodies two types of behavior-and-result.  (1) When a person acts intentionally or knowingly, with a dangerous instrument, the definition of the offense does not require the bodily injury inflicted to be serious, as in the first degree.  However, the offense is still a felony, albeit one class lower.  Assault offenses are intended to penalize injurious conduct to the bodily integrity of the person.  The danger represented by the use of a dangerous instrument is largely inchoate in nature, and, although constituting an aggravating circumstance, the danger is not of the same order as the actual infliction of serious bodily injury.  Hence, the offense is a class C felony.  (2) When a person acts recklessly the person's state of mind is far less culpable than the intentional or knowing actor; however, the employment of a dangerous instrument and the infliction of serious harm present dangers which, in total, require treatment as a class C felony.</P>
<P>  Assault in the third degree, as defined in §707-712, is treated as a misdemeanor.  In subsection (1)(a), where a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, the less serious nature of the injury, together with the absence of aggravating circumstances, warrant the less severe penalty.  In subsection (1)(b), negligent culpability will suffice where the aggravating circumstance of a dangerous instrument is present.  Assault in the third degree is reduced to a petty misdemeanor if the harm is inflicted in a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent.</P>
<P>  The Code's gradation of assaults follows generally the Model Penal Code.[3]  Previous Hawaii law defined assault in terms of attempt to injure another.[4]  Also included was the placing of another in apprehension of being injured.[5]  The Code handles this latter case in the sections on Reckless Endangering (§§707-713 and 714) and Terroristic Threatening (§707-715).  After the definition of the basic offense of assault, the Hawaii Revised Statutes listed three classes of aggravating circumstances, calling for either felony or misdemeanor sanctions, depending upon the severity of the aggravation.[6]  The unaggravated offense was slightly more severe than, but roughly equivalent to, a petty misdemeanor.[7]  Consensual scuffles were included in the unaggravated offense.[8]  Hence the Code is similar in both structure and penalty to prior Hawaii law, but achieves greater economy and clarity of statement.</P>

</B>
<P>  Act 84, Session Laws 1979, added subsection (c) to §707-711 as a means of deterring a rising number of assaults committed against correctional officers.  The Legislature found that due to the very nature of a corrections facility, a high probability existed that correctional workers who were not on duty might be assaulted within the facility.  Conference Committee Report No. 14.</P>
<P>  Act 257, Session Laws 1987, amended §707-711 to give educational workers added protection by making it a crime to assault them.  Senate Conference Committee Report No. 24, House Conference Committee Report No. 20.</P>
<P>  Act 279, Session Laws 1988, amended §707-711 to clarify that second degree assault does not include persons injuring themselves.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1598-88.</P>
