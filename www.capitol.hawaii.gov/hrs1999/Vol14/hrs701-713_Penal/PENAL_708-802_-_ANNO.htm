<P>  Act 124, Session Laws 1981, added this section to enable victims of burglary, theft, and related offenses to obtain the quick return of their property recovered by the police and at the same time to insure the availability of competent evidence at trial.</P>
<P>  Act 194, Session Laws 1990, amended this section to expand the type of property which may be photographed for evidence in a court proceeding.  The legislature felt this amendment would allow victims of property crimes, not previously covered, to obtain their property quickly from the police.
