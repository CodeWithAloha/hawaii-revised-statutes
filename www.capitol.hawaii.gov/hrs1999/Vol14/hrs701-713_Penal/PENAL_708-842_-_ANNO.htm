</B>
<P>  The nature and operation of this section is concisely explained by the Model Penal Code: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This provision is unusual only insofar as it makes classification of robbery depend in part on behavior after the theft might be said to have been accomplished.  The thief's willingness to use force against those who would restrain him in flight strongly suggests that he would have employed it to effect the theft had there been need for it.  No rule-of-thumb is proposed to delimit the time and space of "flight," which should be interpreted in accordance with the rationale.  The concept of "fresh pursuit" will be helpful in suggesting realistic bounds between the occasion of the theft and a later occasion when the escaped thief is apprehended.[1] </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>  Previous Hawaii statutory law failed to provide a standard for the determination of the duration of the "theft" aspect of a robbery--a standard which is needed in order to determine when the employment of force or threatened force converts the "theft" into a "robbery." </P>
