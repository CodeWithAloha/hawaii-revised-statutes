<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal which has not subsequently been set aside or in a conviction as defined in section 701-110(3) and the subsequent prosecution is for:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;Any offense of which the defendant could have been convicted on the first prosecution; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;Any offense for which the defendant should have been tried on the first prosecution under section 701-109 unless the court ordered a separate trial of the offense; or</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;An offense based on the same conduct, unless:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;The offense for which the defendant is subsequently prosecuted requires proof of a fact not required by the former offense and the law defining each of the offenses is intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;    (ii)&#9;The second offense was not consummated when the former trial began.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The former prosecution was terminated by an acquittal or by a final order or judgment for the defendant which has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated and which acquittal, final order, or judgment necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact which must be established for conviction of the second offense.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The former prosecution was improperly terminated, as improper termination is defined in section 701-110(4), and the subsequent prosecution is for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted had the former prosecution not been improperly terminated.
