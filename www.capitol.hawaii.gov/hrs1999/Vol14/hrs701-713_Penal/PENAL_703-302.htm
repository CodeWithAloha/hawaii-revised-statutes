<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§703-302  Choice of evils.</B>  (1)  Conduct which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid an imminent harm or evil to the actor or to another is justifiable provided that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(a)&#9;The harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged; and</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;Neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved; and</P>
<P>&#9;(c)&#9;A legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not otherwise plainly appear.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)  When the actor was reckless or negligent in bringing about the situation requiring a choice of harms or evils or in appraising the necessity for the actor's conduct, the justification afforded by this section is unavailable in a prosecution for any offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)  In a prosecution for escape under section 710-1020 or 710-1021, the defense available under this section is limited to an affirmative defense consisting of the following elements:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(a)&#9;The actor receives a threat, express or implied, of death, substantial bodily injury, or forcible sexual attack;</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;Complaint to the proper prison authorities is either impossible under the circumstances or there exists a history of futile complaints;</P>
<P>&#9;(c)&#9;Under the circumstances there is no time or opportunity to resort to the courts;</P>
<P>&#9;(d)&#9;No force or violence is used against prison personnel or other innocent persons; and</P>
<P>&#9;(e)&#9;The actor promptly reports to the proper authorities when the actor has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §6; gen ch 1993]</P>
