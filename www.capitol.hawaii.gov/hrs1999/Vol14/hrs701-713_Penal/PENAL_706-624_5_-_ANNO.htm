<P>  Act 184, Session Laws 1983, added this section to require notification to a crime victim if a defendant who harmed the victim is released into the community after conviction.  This addition was intended to insure that crime victims "are treated with fairness and respect" and that agencies in the criminal justice system cooperate with each other to provide information and other help to crime victims.  House Conference Committee Report No. 46.</P>
