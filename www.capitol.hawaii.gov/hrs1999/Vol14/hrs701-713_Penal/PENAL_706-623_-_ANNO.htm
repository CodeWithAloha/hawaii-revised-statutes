</B>
<P>  This section is in accord with previous Hawaii law providing a maximum probation period of five years in felony cases.[1]  The prior law did not, however, state a maximum period of suspension of sentence in felony cases--although, by implication, it could have been read as five years also.[2]  With respect to felony cases, this section of the Code changes the law by explicitly correlating the maximum period of suspension with the maximum period of probation.  Whether the defendant should be sentenced to probation because the defendant needs supervision, guidance, assistance, or direction is an independent question; there is no rational basis for providing a longer period for suspension than for probation.</P>
<P>  Because of the structure of courts in Hawaii, some anomalous results obtained under prior law.  Upon the appeal of a misdemeanor case from the district court to the circuit court, the defendant, if conviction was upheld, could have had the defendant's sentence suspended or be sentenced to probation in the same manner and for the same period as a convicted felon.[3]  Had the misdemeanant not appealed the misdemeanant would have been subject solely to the district court, the powers of which were more limited in this area.  Prior to this Code, the district court did not have a probation service; however, the district magistrate could suspend the imposition or execution of sentence on the terms or conditions the district magistrate deemed best.  The period of suspension could not, however, exceed thirteen months.[4]</P>
<P>  The changes which this section makes in the law are obvious.  It provides a maximum period of suspension of sentence or probation for misdemeanants, petty misdemeanants, and felons regardless of the court handling the case.  Secondly, it would allow probation to be utilized by district court magistrates if a probation service is established in that court.</P>

</B>
<P>  Section 623 of the Proposed Code provided that the period of suspension or probation shall be two years in the case of a conviction for a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor.  However, the Legislature reduced the period to one year in the case of a conviction for a misdemeanor and six months in the case of a conviction for a petty misdemeanor, finding the proposed two-year period too severe and inconsistent with the actual length of imprisonment allowed upon conviction for these offenses.  Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).</P>
<P>  Act 124, Session Laws 1989, required courts to grant pre-sentence imprisonment credit to defendants who had been sentenced to imprisonment as a condition of probation and who were detained prior to sentencing.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1342.</P>
<P>  Act 316, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to provide that the terms of probation in chapter 706, part II, other than in this section, shall not apply to sentences of probation imposed under §706-606.3, which creates an option for the expedited sentencing of persons who have committed intra-family sexual assault.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1174, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 849.</P>
<P>  Act 229, Session Laws 1994, amended this section to provide, inter alia, that when a defendant is sentenced to be placed on probation, the period of probation shall be ten years upon conviction of a class A felony unless the court enters the reason therefor on the record and sentences the defendant to a shorter period of probation.  The legislature found that a longer probationary period for class A felony drug offenders would protect the public's interests and safety in the unusual cases where probation may be granted.  Conference Committee Report No. 62.</P>
<P>  Act 157, Session Laws 1995, extended the sunset date of the amendment to this section made by Act 316, Session Laws 1993, from June&nbsp;30, 1995 to June&nbsp;30, 2001.  The legislature found that the expedited sentencing program served as "a viable alternative in a small number of select cases" and that the program should continue to be available within the criminal justice system.  However, the legislature believed that there was insufficient basis to determine whether the program should be made permanent.  Conference Committee Report No. 62.</P>
<P>  Act 172, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to allow for a two-year sentence of probation for domestic violence convictions.  Conference Committee Report No. 80.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Case Notes</P>
</B>
<P>  Subsection (2) pertains to periods of detention served following arrest and prior to the sentence imposed by the court in the first instance; circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to credit defendant for time served in conjunction with previous periods of probation.  79 H. 194, 900 P.2d 770.</P>
<P>  Section does not authorize trial court to compel a criminal defendant to execute a promissory note in the amount of any restitution order, or any balance thereof, as a condition of probation.  83 H. 105, 924 P.2d 1211.</P>
