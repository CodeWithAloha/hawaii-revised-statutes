<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when the crime or crimes which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom the defendant conspired. </P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;It is prima facie evidence that the agreement has been abandoned if neither the defendant nor anyone with whom the defendant conspired did any overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy during the applicable period of limitation. </P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to the individual only if and when the individual advises those with whom the individual conspired of the individual's abandonment or the individual informs the law-enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of the individual's participation therein.
