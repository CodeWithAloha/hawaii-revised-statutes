<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&#9;<B>§701-112  Former prosecution in another jurisdiction:  when a bar.</B>  When behavior constitutes an offense within the concurrent jurisdiction of this State and of the United States or another state, a prosecution in any such other jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this State under any of the following circumstances:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The first prosecution resulted in an acquittal which has not subsequently been set aside or in a conviction as defined in section 701-110(3), and the subsequent prosecution is based on the same conduct, unless:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;The offense for which the defendant is subsequently prosecuted requires proof of a fact not required by the former offense and the law defining each of the offenses is intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;The second offense was not consummated when the former trial began.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The former prosecution was terminated, after the information was filed or the indictment found, by an acquittal or by a final order or judgment for the defendant which has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated and which acquittal, final order, or judgment necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact which must be established for conviction of the offense for which the defendant is subsequently prosecuted.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The former prosecution was improperly terminated, as improper termination is defined in section 701-110(4), and the subsequent prosecution is for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted had the former prosecution not been improperly terminated.
