<DIR>
<DIR>

The instruments described in this section shall be recorded with the bureau of conveyances. </P>
<P>&#9;(f)  For the purposes of this section, an unencumbered interest in real property, stocks, or bonds, means that the interest is not encumbered by any lien or encumbrance or is not currently being used as security for a bail bond. </P>
<P>&#9;(g)  In case the officer taking the bail doubts the sufficiency of the person giving bail, the officer may compel that person, either by oath or otherwise, to furnish proof of the person's sufficiency. [L 1987, c 139, §9(3)]</P>
