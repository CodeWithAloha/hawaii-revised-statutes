<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     [§432G-6]  Protection against insolvency;
net solvency report.  </b>(a)  Net worth requirements are as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Before issuing any certificate of authority, the
commissioner shall require that the dental insurer has an initial net worth of
$2,000,000 and shall thereafter maintain the minimum net worth required under
paragraph (2);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4),
every dental insurer shall maintain a minimum net worth equal to the greater
of:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (A)  $2,000,000;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  Two per cent of annual premium revenues
as reported on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the
commissioner on the first $150,000,000 of premium revenues and one per cent of
annual premium revenues on the premium revenues in excess of $150,000,000;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (C)  An amount equal to the sum of three
months uncovered dental care expenditures as reported on the most recent
financial statement filed with the commissioner; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (D)  An amount equal to eight per cent of
annual dental care expenditures except those paid on a capitated basis as
reported on the most recent financial statement filed with the commissioner;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The minimum net worth requirement set forth in
paragraph (2)(A) shall be phased in as follows:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (A)  Seventy-five per cent of the required
amount by January 1, 2016; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  One hundred per cent of the required
amount by December 31, 2017; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The following shall apply in determining
compliance with the requirements of this subsection:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (A)  In determining net worth, no debt shall
be considered fully subordinated unless the subordination clause is in a form
acceptable to the commissioner.  Any interest obligation relating to the
repayment of any subordinated debt shall be similarly subordinated;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (B)  The interest expenses relating to the
repayment of any fully subordinated debt shall be considered covered expenses;
and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>          (C)  Any debt incurred by a note meeting the
requirements of this section, and otherwise acceptable to the commissioner,
shall not be considered a liability and shall be recorded as equity.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Deposit requirements are as follows:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Unless otherwise provided in this subsection,
each dental insurer shall deposit with the commissioner or, at the discretion
of the commissioner, with any organization or trustee acceptable to the
commissioner through which a custodial or controlled account is utilized, cash,
securities, or any combination of these or other measures that are acceptable
to the commissioner which at all times shall have a value of not less than
$300,000;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A dental service corporation formed and operating
pursuant to chapter 423 that is in operation on July 1, 2013, shall make a
deposit equal to $150,000.  Within one year after January 1, 2014, a dental
service corporation originally formed pursuant to chapter 423 that is reconstituted
under this chapter and in operation on January 1, 2014, shall make an
additional deposit of $150,000 for a total of $300,000;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Deposits shall be an asset of the dental insurer
in the determination of net worth;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  All income from deposits shall be an asset of the
dental insurer.  A dental insurer that has made a securities deposit may
withdraw that deposit or any part thereof after making a substitute deposit of
cash, securities, or any combination of these or other measures of equal amount
and value.  Any securities shall be approved by the commissioner before being
deposited or substituted;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The deposit shall be used to protect the
interests of the dental insurer's enrollees and to assure continuation of
dental care services to enrollees of a dental insurer which is in
rehabilitation or conservation.  The commissioner may use the deposit for
administrative costs directly attributable to a receivership or liquidation. 
If the dental insurer is placed in receivership or liquidation, the deposit
shall be an asset subject to the provisions of article 15 of chapter 431; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  The commissioner may reduce or eliminate the
deposit requirement if the dental insurer deposits with the director of finance
of this State, or the commissioner, or other official body of the state or
jurisdiction of domicile of such dental insurer, for the protection of all
subscribers and enrollees, wherever located, cash, acceptable securities, or
surety, and delivers to the commissioner a certificate to such effect, duly
authenticated by the appropriate state official holding the deposit.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  Every dental insurer, when determining
liabilities, shall include an amount estimated in the aggregate to provide for
any unearned premium and for the payment of all claims for dental care
expenditures which have been incurred, whether reported or unreported, which
are unpaid and for which the organization is or may be liable, and to provide
for the expense of adjustment or settlement of claims.  These liabilities shall
be computed in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner upon
reasonable consideration of the ascertained experience and character of the dental
insurer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Every contract between a dental insurer
and a participating provider shall be in writing and shall set forth that in
the event the dental insurer fails to pay for dental care services as set forth
in the contract, the subscriber or enrollee shall not be liable to the provider
for any sums owed by the dental insurer.  In the event that a contract with a
participating provider has not been reduced to writing as required by this
subsection or that a contract fails to contain the required prohibition, the
participating provider shall not collect or attempt to collect from the
subscriber or enrollee sums owed by the dental insurer.  No participating
provider, or agent, trustee, or assignee thereof, may maintain any action at
law against a subscriber or enrollee to collect sums owed by the dental insurer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The commissioner shall require that each dental
insurer have a plan for handling insolvency which allows for continuation of
benefits for the duration of the contract period for which premiums have been
paid.  In considering such a plan, the commissioner may require:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Insurance to cover the expenses to be paid for
continued benefits after an insolvency;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Provisions in participating provider contracts
that obligate the provider to provide dental care services for the duration of
the period after the dental insurer's insolvency for which premium payment has
been made;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Insolvency reserves;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Acceptable letters of credit; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Any other arrangements acceptable to the
commissioner to assure that benefits are continued as specified in this
subsection.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  An agreement to provide dental care
services between a participating provider and a dental insurer shall require
that a participating provider shall give the dental insurer at least sixty
days' advance notice in the event of termination.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Each dental insurer shall prepare for
review by the commissioner on or before the forty-fifth day of each quarter, a
copy of its quarterly net solvency report verified by at least two principal
officers.  The commissioner may prescribe the forms on which the reports are to
be prepared.  Every dental insurer shall maintain a copy of its current net
solvency report on the premises of its primary place of business.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  The commissioner may order an examination,
subject to article 2 of chapter 431, to determine whether a dental insurer is
in compliance with this section.  Any dental insurer that fails or refuses to
prepare or produce for review the quarterly net solvency report or any of the
documents as required by this section shall be liable for a penalty pursuant to
section 432G&#8209;4(c). [L 2013, c 191, pt of §1]</p>
