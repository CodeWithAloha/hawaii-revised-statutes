<p class=1ParagraphContd>          Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a
member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (3)  A domestic insurer may not
enter into transactions </span>that<span lang=X-NONE> are part of a plan or
series of like transactions with persons within the holding company system if
the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold
amount and thus avoid the review that would otherwise occur</span>; provided
that<span lang=X-NONE> the commissioner determines that the separate
transactions were entered into over any twelve-month period for that purpose,

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (b)  (1)  No domestic insurer shall
pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to
its shareholders until:</span></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph><span lang=X-NONE>         (A)  Thirty days after the
commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within
the period disapproved the payment; or</span></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph><span lang=X-NONE>         (B)  The commissioner has
approved the payment within the thirty-day period.</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (2)  For purposes of this section,
an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution
of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other
dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the
lesser of:</span></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph><span lang=X-NONE>         (A)  Ten per cent of the
insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the thirty-first day of
December next preceding; or</span></p>

<p class=ASubparagraph><span lang=X-NONE>         (B)  The net gain from
operations of a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life
insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve-month period
ending the thirty-first day of December next preceding.</span></p>

<p class=1ParagraphContd>          Extraordinary dividend or distribution shall
not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own
securities.</p>

<p class=1ParagraphContd>              In determining whether a dividend or
distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry
forward income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
paid out as dividends.  This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net
income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including
realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate
preceding calendar years.</p>

<p class=1ParagraphContd>              Notwithstanding any other provisions of
law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is
conditional upon the commissioner's approval thereof, and the declaration shall
confer no rights upon shareholders until the commissioner has either approved
the payment of the dividend or distribution or has not disapproved the payment
within the thirty-day period referred to above.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (c)  (1)  Notwithstanding the
control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the
insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability which they
would otherwise be subject to by law.  The insurer shall be managed so as to
assure its separate operating identity consistent with this article.</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (2)  Nothing herein shall preclude a
domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or
joint use of personnel, property, or services with one or more other persons
under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection (a)(1).</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For purposes of this article, in
determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable
in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its
financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (1)  The size of the insurer as
measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance
in force, and other appropriate criteria;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (2)  The extent to which the
insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (3)  The number and size of risks
insured in each line of business;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (4)  The extent of the geographical
dispersion of the insurer's insured risks;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (5)  The nature and extent of the
insurer's reinsurance program;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (6)  The quality, diversification,
and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (7)  The recent past and projected
future trend in the size of the insurer's investment portfolio;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (8)  The surplus as regards
policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (9)  The adequacy of the insurer's
reserves; and</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>    (10)  The quality and liquidity of
investments in affiliates.  The commissioner may treat any investment as a
disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
policyholders whenever in the commissioner's judgment the investment so
warrants.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In determining the adequacy and
reasonableness of an</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>insurer's surplus, no single factor is necessarily
controlling,</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>and the commissioner shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (1)  Consider the net effect of all
of the factors, along with other factors bearing on the financial condition of
the insurer;</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (2)  In comparing the surplus
maintained by other insurers, consider the extent to which each of these
factors varies among insurers; and</span></p>

<p class=1Paragraph><span lang=X-NONE>     (3)  In determining the quality and
liquidity of investments in subsidiaries, consider the individual subsidiary
and discount or disallow its valuation to the extent warranted by individual
investments. [L 1987, c 349, pt of §8; am L 1990, c 75, §1; am L 1993, c 321,
