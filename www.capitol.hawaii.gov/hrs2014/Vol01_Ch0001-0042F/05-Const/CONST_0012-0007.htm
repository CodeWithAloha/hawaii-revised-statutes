<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>Section 7.</b>  The State reaffirms and
shall protect all rights, customarily and traditionally exercised for
subsistence, cultural and religious purposes and possessed by ahupua‘a tenants
who are descendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited the Hawaiian Islands
prior to 1778, subject to the right of the State to regulate such rights. [Add

<p class=XNotes>  A proposal of the 1978 Constitutional Convention adding a
section 7 defining the terms &quot;Hawaiian&quot; and &quot;native
Hawaiian&quot; was not validly ratified.  Kahalekai v. Doi, 60 H. 324, 590 P.2d
543.  In view of the holding, the revisor has deleted the section and
renumbered section 8 as section 7 under the authority of Resolution No. 29 of
the 1978 Constitutional Convention.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Appellants' contention that native Hawaiian rights were
exclusive and possessory was unsupported in the law.  76 F.3d 280.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff lacked standing to challenge this section, where
plaintiff clearly had not suffered any &quot;injury&quot; as a result of the
section.  188 F. Supp. 2d 1219.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Native Hawaiian rights protected by section may extend beyond
the ahupua‘a in which a native Hawaiian resides where such rights have been
customarily and traditionally exercised in this manner.  73 H. 578, 837 P.2d
1247.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Descendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited islands prior
to 1778 who assert valid customary and traditional Hawaiian rights under §1-1
entitled to protection regardless of their blood quantum.  79 H. 425, 903 P.2d
1246.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Section requires county planning commission to &quot;preserve
and protect&quot; reasonable exercise of customary or traditional native
Hawaiian rights to the extent feasible when issuing special management area use
permits.  79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  While unreasonable or non-traditional uses of land by
non-owner Hawaiians not permitted, western concept of exclusivity as owner's
property right not universally applicable in Hawaii; State however retains
ability to reconcile competing interests under this section.  79 H. 425, 903
P.2d 1246.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  If property is deemed &quot;fully developed&quot;, i.e., lands
zoned and used for residential purposes with existing dwellings, improvements,
and infrastructure, it is always &quot;inconsistent&quot; to permit the
practice of traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights on such property. 
89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  It is the obligation of the person claiming the exercise of a
native Hawaiian right to demonstrate that the right is constitutionally
protected.  89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  To establish the existence of a traditional or customary
native Hawaiian practice, there must be an adequate foundation in the record
connecting the claimed right to a firmly rooted traditional or customary native
Hawaiian practice.  89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to
support claim of the exercise of a constitutionally protected native Hawaiian
right and knowingly entered landowner's property which was fenced in a manner
to exclude others, trial court properly concluded that defendant was unlawfully
on property in violation of §708-814(1).  89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  To fulfill its duty to preserve and protect customary and
traditional native Hawaiian rights to the extent feasible, the land use
commission, in its review of a petition for reclassification of district
boundaries, must, at a minimum, make specific findings and conclusions as to
the identity and scope of the valued resources, the extent those resources will
be affected or impaired by the proposed action, and any feasible action the
commission may take to reasonably protect such rights.  94 H. 31, 7 P.3d 1068.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where land use commission allowed petitioner to direct the
manner in which customary and traditional native Hawaiian practices would be
preserved and protected by the proposed development, prior to any specific
findings and conclusions by the commission as to the effect of the proposed
reclassification on such practices, the commission failed to satisfy its
statutory and constitutional obligations; in delegating its duty to protect
native Hawaiian rights, the commission delegated a non-delegable duty and
thereby acted in excess of its authority.  94 H. 31, 7 P.3d 1068.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where land use commission failed to enter any definitive
findings or conclusions as to the extent of the native Hawaiian practitioners'
exercise of customary and traditional practices in the subject area nor made
any specific findings or conclusions regarding the effects on or the impairment
of any uses under this section, or the feasibility of the protection of those
uses, the commission, as a matter of law, failed to satisfy its statutory and
constitutional obligations.  94 H. 31, 7 P.3d 1068.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where commission on water resource management refused to
permit cross examination of water use applicant's oceanography expert regarding
the limu population along the shoreline, in effect precluding the commission
from effectively balancing the applicant's proposed private commercial use of
water against an enumerated public trust purpose, the commission failed
adequately to discharge its public trust duty to protect native Hawaiians'
traditional and customary gathering rights, as guaranteed by this section, the
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, §220, and §174C-101.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Commission on water resource management's conclusion that
&quot;no evidence was presented&quot; to suggest that the rights of native
Hawaiians would be adversely affected by permit applicant's proposed use
erroneously shifted the burden of proof to complainants; thus, commission
failed to adhere to the proper burden of proof standard to maintain the
protection of native Hawaiians' traditional and customary gathering rights in
discharging its public trust obligations.  116 H. 481, 174 P.3d 320.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where plaintiff--as a member of the general public and a
beneficiary of the public lands trust under this section--made allegations
sufficient to show an injury in fact, even though legitimate §5(f) Admission
Act uses might not necessarily benefit members of the general public, and
because a multiplicity of suits could be avoided by allowing plaintiff to sue
to enforce the State's compliance with the §5(f) trust provisions, plaintiff
had standing to pursue the claims raised in the suit.  121 H. 324, 219 P.3d
1111 (2009).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where defendant, cited three times for residing in a closed
area of a state park, asserted as a defense the legal privilege of native
Hawaiians to engage in customary or traditional native Hawaiian practices under
this section, and showed that: (1) defendant was native Hawaiian; (2) the
claimed right was constitutionally protected as a customary or traditional
native Hawaiian practice; and (3) the conduct occurred on undeveloped property,
in applying the totality of circumstances test, the balancing of interests
weighed in favor of permitting the State to regulate defendant's activities
notwithstanding defendant's argument of privilege.  127 H. 206, 277 P.3d 300
(2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the commission on water resource management's (CWRM)
findings of fact/conclusions of law (FOF/COL), and decision and order (D&amp;O)
lacked findings or conclusions articulating the effect of the amended interim
instream flow standards (IIFS) on the native Hawaiian practices of petitioners,
did not explain the feasibility of protecting those practices, and did not
provide any analysis of the decision's effect on gathering rights, the CWRM
failed to discharge its duty with regard to the feasibility of protecting
native Hawaiian rights; thus, the CWRM's FOF/COL and D&amp;O vacated and
remanded.  128 H. 228, 287 P.3d 129 (2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where to be entitled to intervention, appellee organization
was required to show that gathering of opae was customarily and traditionally
practiced on the subject land and that some of organization's native Hawaiian
members exercised those rights, the record contained sufficient evidence to
establish those requisites; [individual] appellee did not show that appellee's
interest was &quot;personal&quot;, i.e., that it was clearly distinguishable
from that of the general public, where appellee did not assert that appellee or
other native Hawaiians had engaged in any activities that might be protected
under this section.  79 H. 246 (App.), 900 P.2d 1313.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section and/or §1-1 do not authorize for native Hawaiian
grandparents any more visitation rights than §571-46(7) and §571-46.3 authorize
for all grandparents, native and non-native Hawaiian.  112 H. 113 (App.), 144
P.3d 561.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  As it is not per se unreasonable for the State to use a
permitting system to regulate the use of sensitive natural and cultural
resources, where there was no evidence that (1) defendant attempted but was
unable to get a camping permit in order to conduct defendant's cultural and
religious practices, and (2) limiting the number of visitors and length of stay
in Kalalau Valley for health, safety and resource protection, and for the State
to manage, supervise, and direct ancient Hawaiian site restoration programs was
unreasonable, the district court properly denied defendant's claim of
constitutional privilege.  124 H. 329 (App.), 243 P.3d 289 (2010).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where nothing in expert's testimony, defendant's evidence, or
district court's findings of fact supported the conclusion that ancient
Hawaiian usage included such an extensive right to take up residency in Kalalau
Valley, without permission, clear the land, build a shelter, cultivate and
plant crops, and modify for one's own use the land of others, even if that use
involved otherwise recognized customary or traditional subsistence, religious
or cultural practices, defendant failed to meet defendant's burden to
demonstrate that defendant's conduct fell within the scope of constitutional
protection.  124 H. 329 (App.), 243 P.3d 289 (2010).</p>
