<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor
had standing to challenge the &quot;advertising&quot; disclaimer requirements
in subsection (a)(2)(B); first, even if plaintiff had already published
advertisements with the disclaimers, it did not mean that it faced no injury;
second, plaintiff sought a declaration that it need not include disclaimers in
the future and challenged those statutes facially; third, plaintiff did not
have to publish the advertisements without the disclaimers to have standing;
finally, a favorable ruling would have enabled plaintiff to publish its
advertisements without the disclaimers and fear of violating the law.  872 F.
Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor's
as-applied challenge to the disclaimer requirement in subsection (a)(2)(B) and
the corresponding definition of &quot;advertisement&quot; in §11-302, which
included the &quot;electioneering communications&quot; definitions in
§11-341(c), rejected; the court concluded that the plaintiff's advertisements
fit within the regulatory &quot;safe harbor&quot;--they were an &quot;advertisement&quot;
that was an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; and was the functional
equivalent of express advocacy under §11-341(c).  872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor's
facial challenge to the disclaimer requirement in subsection (a)(2)(B) failed;
disclosure requirements could apply to issue advocacy, so long as the exacting
scrutiny test was otherwise met, and disclosure and disclaimer
requirements--such as requiring a disclaimer under federal law that a
communication &quot;was not authorized by any candidate or candidate's
committee&quot;--satisfied the exacting scrutiny test; in effect, the U.S.
Supreme Court in &quot;Citizens United had effectively disposed of any attack on
... attribution and disclaimer requirements&quot;.  872 F. Supp. 2d 1023
(2012).</p>
