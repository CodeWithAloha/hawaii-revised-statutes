<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §38-2  Authorized; conditions.</b>  (a)  All
moneys in the state treasury may be deposited by the director to the credit of
the State in any depository which the director, with the approval of the
governor, may select, pursuant to this section, and any sums so deposited shall
be deemed to be in the state treasury; provided that the depository in which
the money is deposited furnish security as hereinafter provided.  In selecting
a depository the class of security offered shall be considered as the basis of
selection and due regard shall be given to a depository doing business in the
State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  No more than forty per cent of the
aggregate amount of moneys of the State available for deposit and on deposit in
the state treasury may be deposited in depositories without the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  No more than sixty per cent of the
aggregate amount of moneys of the State available for deposit and on deposit in
the state treasury may be deposited in any one depository; provided that if the
yield offered by any one depository in the State is greater than the yield
offered by other depositories in the State, then, consistent with the safety
and liquidity of such moneys, more than sixty per cent of the aggregate amount
of moneys available for deposit and on deposit in the stated treasury may be
deposited in such depository within the State offering a higher yield.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The director shall consider the beneficial
effects to the State of using depositories within the State, as well as the
safety and liquidity of the sums to be deposited in the depository and the
yield offered by the depository prior to the selection of the depository.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In case of loan fund money for which there
is no immediate need, or expenditures from which would not be made for at least
three months, the director may place these funds on time deposit on such terms
and at such rates of interest as may be allowed by a depository to other
depositors.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  All deposits of money, except time
deposits, shall be paid upon demand on checks signed by the director and countersigned
by the comptroller, or by the payment of a certificate of deposit issued by the
depository, which certificate shall be endorsed by the payee named therein, as
well as by the comptroller, or by preauthorized automatic transfer of funds
between transaction accounts held within the same depository.  Transaction
accounts, as defined in Regulation D of the Federal Reserve System, as
authorized by Section 19 (12 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) of the Federal Reserve Act,
includes all checking accounts, both demand and interest bearing.  Each
depository shall at the end of every month render to the director a statement,
in duplicate, for each of the funds of the State, showing the daily balances on
open commercial account which were held by it during the month.  The duly
authorized representatives of any depository shall at all times during office
hours have access to the securities deposited by the depository to secure the
deposits of the State for the purpose of examining the same and removing the
coupons that may have matured, the examination to be made in the presence of
the director or the director's representative. [L 1970, c 51, pt of §1; am L
1980, c 229, §1; gen ch 1985; am L 1988, c 78, §3; am L 1994, c 21, §1]</p>
