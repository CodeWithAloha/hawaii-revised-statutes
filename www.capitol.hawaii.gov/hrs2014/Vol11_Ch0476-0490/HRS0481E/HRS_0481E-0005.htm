<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§481E-5]  Certificate of registration;
issuance or denial; renewal.</b>  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (b), the director shall issue a certificate of registration to an
individual who complies with section 481E&#8209;4(a) or whose application has
been accepted under section 481E&#8209;4(b).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The director may refuse to issue a
certificate of registration if the director determines that the applicant has
engaged in conduct that has a significantly adverse effect on the applicant's
fitness to act as an athlete agent.  In making the determination, the director
may consider whether the applicant has:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Been convicted of a crime that, if committed in
this State, would be a crime involving moral turpitude or a felony;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Made a materially false, misleading, deceptive,
or fraudulent representation in the application or as an athlete agent;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Engaged in conduct that would disqualify the
applicant from serving in a fiduciary capacity;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Engaged in conduct prohibited by section 481E&#8209;13;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Had a registration or licensure as an athlete
agent suspended, revoked, or denied or been refused renewal of registration or
licensure as an athlete agent in any state;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Engaged in conduct the consequence of which was
that a sanction, suspension, or declaration of ineligibility to participate in
an interscholastic or intercollegiate athletic event was imposed on a
student-athlete or educational institution; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Engaged in conduct that significantly adversely
reflects on the applicant's credibility, honesty, or integrity.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  In making a determination under subsection
(b), the director shall consider:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  How recently the conduct occurred;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The nature of the conduct and the context in
which it occurred; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any other relevant conduct of the applicant.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  An athlete agent may apply to renew a
registration by submitting an application for renewal in a form prescribed by
the director.  An application filed under this section is a government record. 
The application for renewal shall be signed by the applicant under penalty of
perjury or of unsworn falsification to authorities, as applicable, and shall
contain current information on all matters required in an original
registration.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  An individual who has submitted an
application for renewal of registration or licensure in another state, in lieu
of submitting an application for renewal in the form prescribed pursuant to
subsection (d), may file a copy of the application for renewal and a valid
certificate of registration or licensure from the other state.  The director
shall accept the application for renewal from the other state as an application
for renewal in this State if the application to the other state:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Was submitted in the other state within the six
months next preceding the filing in this State and the applicant certifies the
information contained in the application for renewal is current;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Contains information substantially similar to or
more comprehensive than that required in an application for renewal submitted
in this State; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Was signed by the applicant under penalty of
perjury or of a related offense in the other state.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  A certificate of registration or a renewal
of a registration is valid for two years. [L 2007, c 248, pt of §2]</p>
