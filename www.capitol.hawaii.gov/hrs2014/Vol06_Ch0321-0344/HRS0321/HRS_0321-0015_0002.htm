designee may request criminal history record information which includes Federal
Bureau of Investigation data through the Hawaii criminal justice data center on
all prospective applicants, operators, direct patient access employees, and
adult volunteers of healthcare facilities.  In addition, in the case of any
healthcare facility to be operated in a private residence, the department of
health or the department's designee may request criminal history record

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The department may revoke or suspend a
current license, impose penalties or fines, or deny an application for a
license under rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 if the applicant, operator,
employee, or adult volunteer at the healthcare facility or, in the case of any
healthcare facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the
home other than the client, refuses to authorize the department or the
department's designee to conduct a criminal history record check, obtain
criminal history record information for verification, or consent to be
fingerprinted.  In addition, the department may revoke or suspend a current
license, impose penalties or fines, or deny an application for a license if the
applicant, operator, direct patient access employee, or adult volunteer at the
healthcare facility, or, in the case of a healthcare facility operated in a
private residence, any adult living in the home other than the client, has any
disqualifying information.  The department may also revoke or suspend a current
license, impose penalties or fines, or deny an application for a license if the
department determines, based upon consideration of the criminal history
information, that the applicant, operator, direct patient access employee, or
adult volunteer at the healthcare facility, or, in the case of a healthcare
facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other
than the client, is unsuitable to work or live in close proximity to the
residents of the healthcare facility such that the health, safety, and welfare
of the residents of the healthcare facility could be at risk.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  Notwithstanding any other law to the

patient access employees, and adult volunteers at the healthcare facility and,
in the case of a facility operated in a private residence, all adults living in
the home other than the clients.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (j)  The department, or the department's
designee, in obtaining and relying upon the criminal history record checks, is
presumed to be acting in good faith and shall be immune from civil liability
for taking or recommending action based upon the criminal history record
information.  The good faith presumption may be rebutted upon a showing by the
person or entity of a lack of good faith, and proof by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the department relied upon information or opinion that it knew
was false or misleading.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (k)  Any applicant or operator who receives
information from the department or the department's designee relating to a
criminal history record check of a direct patient access employee or adult
volunteer or, in the case of a healthcare facility operated in a private
residence, an adult living in the home other than the clients, is presumed to
be acting in good faith and shall be immune from civil liability for taking or
recommending action based upon the department's recommendation or direction. 
Nothing in this section shall affect rights, obligations, remedies, liabilities,
or standards of proof under chapters 368 and 378.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Criminal history record information shall be
used exclusively by the department or the department's designee for the sole
purpose of determining whether an applicant, operator, direct patient access
employee, or adult volunteer at a healthcare facility, or, in the case of a
facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other
than the clients is suitable for working or living in close proximity to
residents of a healthcare facility such that the health, safety, and welfare of
the residents would not be at risk. [L 2006, c 220, §2; am L Sp 2009, c 21, §5;
am L 2011, c 220, §11; am L 2012, c 285, §2]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The 2011 amendment is exempt from the repeal and reenactment
condition of L Sp 2009, c 21.  L 2011, c 220, §20.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  L 2006, c 220, §6 provides:</p>

committee of five members with representatives from the department of health,
department of human services, provider organizations and community, as
appointed by the directors of the department of health and department of human
services to meet minimally on a quarterly basis to review and evaluate the
process undertaken by the departments in effecting criminal history record
checks and provide recommendations to the directors of the departments as
relevant.  Members shall serve a term of two years which may be extended at the
discretion of the directors of the departments and will report to departmental
