<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§707-722  Unlawful imprisonment in the
second degree.</b>  (1)  A person commits the offense of unlawful imprisonment
in the second degree if the person knowingly restrains another person.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  In any prosecution under this section it
is an affirmative defense, that (a) the person restrained was less than
eighteen years old, (b) the defendant was a relative of the victim, and (c) the
defendant's sole purpose was to assume custody over the victim.  In that case,
the liability of the defendant, if any, is governed by section 707-727 and the
defendant may be convicted under section 707-727 although charged under this
section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  In any prosecution under this section it
is an affirmative defense, that the person restrained (a) was on or in the
immediate vicinity of the premises of a retail mercantile establishment for the
purpose of investigation or questioning as to the ownership of any merchandise;
(b) was restrained in a reasonable manner and for not more than a reasonable
time; (c) was restrained to permit such investigation or questioning by a
police officer or by the owner of the retail mercantile establishment, the
owner's authorized employee or agent; and (d) that such police officer, owner,
employee or agent had reasonable grounds to believe that the person so detained
was committing or attempting to commit theft of merchandise on the premises.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (4)  Unlawful imprisonment in the second degree
is a misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1981, c 171, §2; gen ch 1993]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §§707-720 TO 722</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  These three offenses are gradations based upon the underlying
conduct of interference with a person's liberty.  The gradations are based upon
the seriousness of the circumstances or purpose attending this interference. 
The interference with liberty is dealt with under the general definition of
&quot;restrain.&quot;[1]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the restraint is for the purpose of personal gain, or
for certain purposes which are themselves unlawful, the offense is termed
&quot;kidnapping,&quot; and the most severe sanctions apply.[2]  The statutory
provision for mitigation, in cases where the victim is released unharmed, is
intended (1) to differentiate according to the severity of the actual harm
involved, and (2) to encourage the actor to proceed less dangerously once the
criminal course of conduct has begun.[3]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law defined kidnapping as the forceful,
fraudulent, or deceitful imprisonment, seizing, detention, or inveiglement of
any person.[4]  The difficulty in dealing with such words is immediately
apparent.  Moreover, the mandatory term of life imprisonment is thought
somewhat too harsh to be imposed as a rule.  Instances of kidnapping which are
so heinous as to call for a sanction commensurate with that for murder will
almost necessarily fall under the provisions for extended sentences, whereby
the normal sentence for a class A felony may be extended to life
imprisonment.[5]  The Code's sentence is commensurate with that of the Model
Penal Code and with most recent state revisions.[6]</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where the restraint poses a danger of serious injury, or
where it involves involuntary servitude, the offense, defined in §707-721, is
&quot;unlawful imprisonment in the first degree.&quot;  This offense is a class
C felony, commensurate with 18 U.S.C. §§1581 et seq., which, enacted pursuant
to the Thirteenth Amendment, makes it a felony to hold or return a person
&quot;to a condition of peonage,&quot; or to kidnap, carry away, or hold a
person to be &quot;sold into involuntary servitude, or held as a slave.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Unlawful imprisonment in the second degree consists of any
knowing restraint of another person.  The offense is graded as a misdemeanor,
and is commensurate with the common-law offense of false imprisonment: it is
also the substantial equivalent of &quot;unlawful imprisonment&quot; under
previous Hawaii law.[7]  The lawful exercise of custodial powers over a minor
is, of course, excluded from the operation of this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  It must be noted that, in all the above offenses involving
interference with personal liberty, the duration of restraint necessary for
conviction depends upon the intent and attendant circumstances.  In this
regard, something like a reasonable standard applies.  Hence, a short restraint
in an area where the victim might suffocate or come to other bodily harm would
constitute a substantial interference with liberty under these sections. 
However, a short restraint in a store, based on a reasonable suspicion of
shoplifting, would not amount to a substantial interference with liberty for
the purposes of these offenses.[8]</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A specific unanimity jury instruction was not required for
offense of second degree unlawful imprisonment under this section where
defendant's conduct, as proved by the prosecution, constituted a continuing
course of conduct &quot;set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent
force&quot;, with &quot;one general intent ... and one continuous plan&quot;. 
95 H. 440, 24 P.3d 32 (2001).</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §§707-720 TO 707-722</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  When the Legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it added the
affirmative defense now set forth in §707-722(3).  It is an attempt to assure
that reasonable restraint is allowed for the purpose of apprehending persons
suspected of &quot;shoplifting.&quot;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Conference Committee Report of the Legislature stated:</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;It is the intent of your Committee that 'reasonable
grounds' includes, but is not limited to, knowledge that a person has concealed
possession of unpurchased merchandise of the retail mercantile establishment;
that 'reasonable time' means the time necessary to permit the person detained
to make a statement or to refuse to make a statement, and the time necessary to
examine employees, and records of the mercantile establishment relative to the
ownership of the merchandise; and that 'retail mercantile establishment' means
a place where goods, wares, or merchandise are offered to the public for
sale.&quot;  Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 147, Session Laws 2008, amended §707-720(1) by making it
a crime of kidnapping to intentionally or knowingly restrain another person
with the intent to unlawfully obtain the labor or services of the person,
regardless of whether a debt collection is involved.  The legislature
strengthened the laws on prostitution and related offenses to deter and punish
sexual exploitation of minors, including obscenity-related activities. 
Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 147, Session Laws 2008, amended §707-721(1) by deleting a
reference to involuntary servitude.  Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.</p>
