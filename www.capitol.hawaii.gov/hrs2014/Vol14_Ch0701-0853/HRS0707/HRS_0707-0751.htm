<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 214, Session Laws 1978, added these sections to prevent
the sexual exploitation of children.  Dealing with activities involving the
participation of children without attempting to define the conduct in terms of
pornography, these sections classify the offenses as offenses against the
person rather than pornography.  It is an offense for anyone to engage in the
proscribed activities whether the material or performance involving a minor is
pornographic or not.  Senate Conference Committee Report No. 27-78, House
Conference Committee Report No. 21.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 218, Session Laws 1982, amended these sections to clarify
that the offense of promoting child abuse applies to the use of minors in
pornographic material.  Section 707-751 was found to be unconstitutional because
&quot;the statute prohibited speech protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendment of the United States Constitution...and because the statute did not
incorporate the three-part test defining obscenity as enunciated by the U.S.
Supreme Court in the case of Miller v. California, the statute prohibited
non-obscene as well as obscene materials.&quot;  The constitutionality of the
section is on appeal but the Legislature found &quot;that any question as to
what is being prohibited should be clarified.&quot;  House Conference Committee
Report No. 4, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 3.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 91, Session Laws 1988, amended §707-750 by reclassifying
the offense of promoting child abuse in the first degree from a class B felony
to a class A felony.  The legislature found that victims of child abuse are the
least able to defend themselves, and the resulting emotional scars of these
victims increase the likelihood of further contact with the criminal justice
system; therefore, a more severe punishment for this offense is warranted.  The
legislature also found that reclassifying this offense will make the
classification consistent with the current penalty for sexual abuse in the
first degree involving a minor.  House Standing Committee Report No. 481-88,
Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2545.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 363, Session Laws 1997, amended §§707-750 and 707-751 to
include persons producing or making pornographic material involving minors
under the offense of child abuse.  The legislature found that under existing
child abuse laws, in order for a person to be charged with child abuse, the
pornographic materials must show a minor engaged in or assisting others to
engage in a sexual act.  This loophole in the law allowed persons producing
those materials to exploit children by using them in sexually explicit poses
without technically violating the law. The legislature believed that it was
important to extend the scope of the offense of child abuse to include
producing material in which children are exploited through sexually explicit conduct.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Act also, inter alia, amended the definition of
&quot;sexual conduct&quot; to include lascivious exhibition of the genital or
pubic area of a minor, and added the definitions of &quot;lascivious&quot; and
&quot;community standards&quot;, in both §§707-750 and 707-751.  Section
707-751 was also amended to include possession of pornographic material
involving children as an offense.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 757,
House Standing Committee Report No. 1214.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 200, Session Laws 2002, amended these sections by, among
other things, defining &quot;child pornography&quot; to encompass
computer-generated representations of minors.  The legislature found that Act
200 addressed the problem of utilizing computer technology in committing crimes
against children.  House Standing Committee Report No. 417-02, Conference
Committee Report No. 36-02.</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>  </b>Act 212, Session Laws 2012, amended §707-751 to
provide greater protection for children by addressing instances of possession
of particularly violent or egregious child pornography.  Specifically, Act 212
amended the offense of promoting child abuse in the second degree to include
possession of thirty or more images of child pornography where the content of
at least one image contains a minor younger than the age of twelve,
sadomasochistic abuse of a minor, or bestiality involving a minor.  The
legislature found that child pornography was a permanent record of the actual
sexual abuse, exploitation, and assault of innocent and helpless
children.&nbsp; The legislature further found that Hawaii's child pornography
laws should be strengthened and should distinguish between the various forms of
child pornography.&nbsp; Prior to Act 212, possession of any form of child
pornography was covered under the offense of promoting child abuse in the third
degree, but a violation was only a class C felony. &nbsp;Act 212 amended the
offense of promoting child abuse in the second degree, a class B felony, to
include particularly violent or egregious child pornography.  Conference
Committee Report No. 24-12.</p>
