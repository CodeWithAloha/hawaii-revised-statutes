<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§703-302  Choice of evils.</b>  (1)  Conduct
which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid an imminent harm or evil to
the actor or to another is justifiable provided that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   The harm or evil sought to be avoided by such
conduct is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the
offense charged; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Neither the Code nor other law defining the
offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation
involved; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   A legislative purpose to exclude the justification
claimed does not otherwise plainly appear.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  When the actor was reckless or negligent
in bringing about the situation requiring a choice of harms or evils or in
appraising the necessity for the actor's conduct, the justification afforded by
this section is unavailable in a prosecution for any offense for which
recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish
culpability.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (3)  In a prosecution for escape under section
710-1020 or 710-1021, the defense available under this section is limited to an
affirmative defense consisting of the following elements:</p>

of death, substantial bodily injury, or forcible sexual attack;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   Complaint to the proper prison authorities is
either impossible under the circumstances or there exists a history of futile
complaints;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (c)   Under the circumstances there is no time or

<p class=1Paragraph>    (d)   No force or violence is used against prison
personnel or other innocent persons; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (e)   The actor promptly reports to the proper
authorities when the actor has attained a position of safety from the immediate
threat. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §6; gen ch 1993]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §703-302</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section defines what is often called the defense of
&quot;necessity.&quot;  It permits the actor, in certain limited situations, to
justify disobedience to criminal law if the harm the actor sought to avert by
the actor's disobedience far outweighed the harm sought to be prevented by the
law.  Necessity has been accepted as a defense at common law in some cases, and
has been given statutory recognition in a number of enacted codes.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The section may be used, first, to justify only slightly
harmful acts which are necessary to avoid a far greater harm. For instance, a
court would hardly wish to punish a person for driving at night without the
proper lights when the person did so only to summon help to extinguish a fire. 
The section also provides a justification for more serious acts.  For example, it
could be used to justify the taking of life to avoid a far greater loss of
life.  In a classic case, a ship's crew threw certain passengers overboard to
lighten an overloaded boat, which would otherwise have sunk with much greater
loss of life.  This section would justify the action if all of its conditions
are met.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There are numerous reasons supporting the defense of
necessity.  First, because an individual will probably kill one person, or a
few, to avoid the deaths of many others regardless of what the law may say,
punishment in such situations would fail to attain its objective of deterrence
and would not reflect widely held views about what would be the moral thing to
do in such a situation.  Second, the life of every individual is assumed to be of
equal value, and therefore a numerical preponderance in lives saved over those
sacrificed establishes an ethical and legal justification for the otherwise
criminal act.  Third, there are numerous safeguards built into §703-302.  The
danger causing the necessity of choosing between evils must be imminent. 
Moreover, subsection (2) provides that if the necessity of choosing between
harms or evils results from the defendant's recklessness or negligence, the
defense is not available in a prosecution of any offense for which recklessness
or negligence, as the case may be, suffices for conviction.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  It is no defense under this section that the defendant
thought compliance with a statute immoral or unwise; the legislative decision
to make particular conduct criminal is to be given great weight.  However, this
defense is probably in accord with normal legislative intentions, because blind
obedience is unlikely to be required in the face of an emergency.  The whole
matter, with all of its ramifications is to be weighed by the court and the
jury in the same manner as in any criminal proceeding.  If the defendant's
conduct was not necessary, if one evil was not greater than the other, if the
defendant exceeded the reasonable bounds of intelligence and morality, the defendant
may be convicted for the defendant's conduct notwithstanding the defendant's
attempts to justify the defendant's actions.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Finally, many commentators have had difficulty with the
concept of necessity because of the possibility of unforeseeable changes in the
perilous situation.  For instance, if a number of passengers are thrown
overboard from a ship to save a much larger number of persons, there is really
no way for the actors to foresee the exact moment when a rescue ship may
arrive.  There is always the chance that help will arrive in time to make the
emergency action unnecessary.  Such objections, however, fail to take account
of the fact that other defenses which are predicated on a threat to person or
property can take account only of the probability of harm.  One can never
guarantee that the uplifted knife will be plunged into the victim.  &quot;If
necessity is not admitted where there is a high degree of probability of
disastrous consequences if action is not taken, then it can never be admitted.&quot;[1] 
A person faced with such seeming necessity is and will remain in a personal
moral quandary because of the person's uncertainty.  Our only point is that the
threat of criminal punishment is unneeded here.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  There has been no previous statutory provision or case law
development in Hawaii on the defense of necessity; this section represents a
needed addition to the law.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §703-302</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The Legislature accepted §302 of the Proposed Draft without
modification.  Subsection (2) provides that the defense of justification based
on a choice of evils is unavailable where recklessness or negligence suffices
to establish culpability when the actor was reckless or negligent in bringing
about the situation requiring a choice of harms or evils or in appraising the
necessity for the actor's conduct.  However, in light of the Legislature's
introduction of the &quot;reasonable man standard&quot; in §703-300, it appears
that negligence on the actor's part in bringing about the situation or in
appraising the necessity for the actor's conduct will be sufficient to
eliminate the defense in cases which otherwise require intent, knowledge, or
recklessness to establish culpability.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defense of necessity is available to prisoners escaping from
prison.  58 H. 252, 566 P.2d 1378.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The elements of the choice of evils defense are limited to
those enumerated by the express language of this section and common law
&quot;considerations&quot; have not been incorporated into the statutory
formulation.  90 H. 58, 976 P.2d 372 (1998).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Choice of evils defense could not apply where defendant had
dumped marijuana over lanai railing, thereby eliminating any threat of imminent
harm to wife from marijuana use as required under subsection (1)(a); thus, no
imminent harm was present to justify defendant's physical abuse of wife.  93 H.
63, 996 P.2d 268 (2000).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The exclusivity of the narrow choice of evils defense set
forth in subsection (3) is limited to prosecutions for escape from correctional
or detention facilities but not to prosecutions for escape from custody that
does not implicate an incarcerational setting; the generic choice of evils
defense set forth in subsection (1) is applicable in a prosecution for escape
from non-incarcerational custody.  96 H. 83, 26 P.3d 572 (2001).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  A dolphin is not &quot;another&quot; within the meaning of
this section.  1 H. App. 19, 613 P.2d 1328.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  &quot;Necessity&quot; or &quot;choice of evils&quot; defense
discussed.  9 H. App. 115, 826 P.2d 884.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Harm committed by defendant resisting an order to stop a
motor vehicle under §710-1027(1) by driving away after traffic stop not
reasonably designed to actually avoid possible serious physical harm to
defendant or passenger under subsection (1)(a).  81 H. 147 (App.), 913 P.2d 558
(1996).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where case was covered by the defense of defense of others
under §703-305 and, possibly, self-defense under §703-304, the choice of evils
defense under this section did not apply.  90 H. 175 (App.), 977 P.2d 183
(1999).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the
&quot;choice of evils&quot; defense where, pursuant to subsection (1)(b), the
Hawaii Penal Code provided a defense (self-defense) dealing with the specific
situation involved.  91 H. 450 (App.), 984 P.2d 1276 (1999).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The choice of evils defense under this section and the duress
defense under §702-231<b> </b>are not, as a matter of statutory law,
inconsistent.  93 H. 399 (App.), 4 P.3d 533 (2000).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The more specific choice of evils affirmative defense for
prison escape situations under subsection (3) must be construed in conjunction
with the more general choice of evils justification defense under subsection
(1); thus, any escape on the part of a prisoner must be conduct which a
prisoner believes to be necessary to avoid any imminent harm or evil to the
prisoner.  93 H. 399 (App.), 4 P.3d 533 (2000).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Unborn children are not included within the definition of
&quot;another&quot; or &quot;person&quot; for purposes of the Hawaii Penal
Code; thus, defendant could not justify defendant's physical abuse of
girlfriend on grounds that defendant was protecting &quot;another&quot; or a
third person, specifically, defendant's unborn child.  101 H. 3 (App.), 61 P.3d
514 (2002).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court erred when it gave its choice of evils
instruction as evidence did not support a choice of evils instruction; however,
there was no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to defendant's
conviction.  105 H. 319 (App.), 97 P.3d 395 (2004).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Trial court did not err in denying defendant's request that
in addition to the choice of evils defense under this section, jury be
instructed on the justification defenses of use of force in the protection of
self and others under §§703-304 and 703-305; defendant's theory of defense was
fully and adequately covered by the choice of evils instruction which the trial
court gave and under the circumstances of the case, there was no reasonable
possibility that the jury, which rejected defendant's choice of evils defense,
might have embraced defenses based on §§703-304 and 703-305.  114 H. 507
(App.), 164 P.3d 765 (2007).</p>
