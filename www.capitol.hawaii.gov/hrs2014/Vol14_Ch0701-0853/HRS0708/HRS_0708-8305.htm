<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§708-8305  Unlicensed contractor fraud;
valuation of property.</b>  (1)  For purposes of unlicensed contractor fraud,
the value of the property shall be the greater of:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (a)   The value of property as provided in section
708-801; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (b)   The total value of all moneys and any assets of
value paid or lost by the victim or victims pursuant to the same scheme or
course of conduct.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (2)  The value of any work done by the
unlicensed contractor shall not be used as an offset for the value of the
property calculated under this section. [L 2012, c 244, pt of §1; am L 2013, c
26, §1]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §§708-8300 TO 708-8305</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 244, Session Laws 2012, added these sections to deter
unlicensed contracting activity.  Specifically, Act 244 added a new part
containing these sections to chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statutes, that
established:  (1) misdemeanor and felony offenses relating to unlicensed
contracting activity; (2) felony offenses relating to unlicensed contractor
fraud; and (3) a method for valuation of property in unlicensed contractor
fraud cases.  The legislature found that unlicensed contractors often operate
without regard to safety and building requirements, unfairly undercut
legitimate and licensed business operations, place consumers at risk, and cost
the State millions of dollars in lost tax revenue.  The legislature further
found that unlicensed contractors often continue to engage in illegal work
despite receiving civil penalties.&nbsp; Authorizing the imposition of criminal
penalties on unlicensed contractors would help reduce the number of unlicensed
contractors performing illegal work, promote legitimate businesses, protect
consumers, and enhance state revenues.  Senate Standing Committee Report No.
3348, Conference Committee Report No. 59-12.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 26, Session Laws 2013, amended §708-8305 to clarify that
the value of any work done by an unlicensed contractor shall not be used as an
offset in calculating the value of the property in unlicensed contractor fraud
cases.  Minimum thresholds for the total value of the property over which a
person obtains control must be met in order for an act to constitute unlicensed
contractor fraud in the first or second degree.  By permitting an offset of the
value of work illegally performed by an unlicensed contractor, the value of the
property was less likely to meet the threshold necessary to constitute the
offense.  Act 26 made it clear that no offset should be applied when
calculating the property value for the offenses.  Senate Standing Committee
Report No. 456, House Standing Committee Report No. 1410.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act ­­­182, Session Laws 2013, amended §708-8300(1) by
clarifying that a contractor who inadvertently fails to maintain licensing
requirements and who subsequently corrects the failure so that there was a
lapse of no more than sixty days in licensure shall not be guilty of unlicensed
contracting activity.  Act 182 was intended to clarify that contractors
licensed under chapter 444, Hawaii Revised Statutes, who inadvertently failed
to renew their licenses should not be treated as unlicensed contractors after
the subsequent renewal of their licenses.  Act 182 was consistent with existing
licensure requirements under chapter 444, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by
clarifying that a lapse in licensure of no more than sixty days does not constitute
unlicensed contracting activity.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1373.</p>
