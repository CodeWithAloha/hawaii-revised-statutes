filed a claim for benefits, based on such service under the law of this State.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  An &quot;American employer&quot;, for purposes of

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The term &quot;employment&quot; shall

Canada, and (b) the place from which the service is directed or controlled is
in this State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  &quot;Employment&quot; includes service
performed by an individual in agricultural labor as defined in section 383-9

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  For the purposes of this section any individual
who is a member of a crew furnished by a crew leader to perform service in
agricultural labor for any other person shall be treated as an employee of such
crew leader:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (A)  If such crew leader holds a valid
certificate of registration under the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of
1963; or substantially all the members of such crew operate or maintain
tractors, mechanized harvesting or cropdusting equipment, or any other
mechanized equipment, which is provided by such crew leader; and</p>

shall be treated as the employer of such individual; and</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Such other person shall be treated as
having paid cash remuneration to such individual in an amount equal to the
amount of cash remuneration paid to such individual by the crew leader (either
on the crew leader's own behalf or on behalf of such other person) for the
service in agricultural labor performed for such other person.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  For the purposes of this subsection, the term
&quot;crew leader&quot; means an individual who:</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  Pays (either on the crew leader's own
behalf or on behalf of such other person) the individuals so furnished by the
crew leader for the service in agricultural labor performed by them; and</p>

with such other person under which such individual is designated as an employee
of such other person. [L 1939, c 219, §2(k)(1); am L 1941, c 304, §1, pt of
