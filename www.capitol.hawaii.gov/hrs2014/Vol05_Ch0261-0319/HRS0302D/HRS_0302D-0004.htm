for eligible entities.  </b>(a) <b> </b>The commission created under section 302D-3
may authorize public charter schools anywhere in the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Governing boards of accredited public and
private postsecondary institutions, including community colleges, technical
colleges, and four-year universities may apply to the board, pursuant to this
section, for statewide, regional, or local chartering authority, in accordance
with each institution's regular operating jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  A county or state agency may apply to the
board, pursuant to this section, for chartering authority.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Governing boards of non-profit or
charitable organizations, which are exempt from federal taxes under section
501(c)(3) or 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, may apply to the board,
and may be granted statewide chartering authority.  Nonpublic sectarian or
religious organizations and any other charitable organization which in their
federal Internal Revenue Service Form 1023, Part IV, describe activities
indicating a religious purpose, are not eligible to apply to become an
authorizer under this chapter.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The board shall establish, through
administrative rules, the annual application and approval process for all
entities eligible to apply for chartering authority pursuant to this section;
provided that the board shall not approve any application for chartering
authority until July 1, 2014, or until the board adopts rules, whichever is
later.  By June 30 of each year, the board shall make available information and
guidelines for all eligible entities concerning the opportunity to apply for
chartering authority under this chapter.  The application process shall require
each interested eligible entity to submit an application that clearly explains
or presents the following elements:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Written notification of intent to serve as an
authorizer in accordance with this chapter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The applicant entity's strategic vision for
chartering;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A plan to support the vision presented, including
explanation and evidence of the applicant entity's budget and personnel
capacity and commitment to execute the responsibilities of quality charter
authorizing, in accordance with this chapter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  A draft or preliminary outline of the request for
proposals that the applicant entity, if approved as an authorizer, would issue
to solicit public charter school applicants;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  A draft of the performance framework that the
applicant entity, if approved as an authorizer, would use to guide the
establishment of a charter contract and for ongoing oversight and evaluation of
public charter schools, consistent with the requirements of this chapter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  A draft of the applicant entity's renewal,
revocation, and nonrenewal processes, consistent with section 302D-18;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  A statement of assurance that the applicant
entity seeks to serve as an authorizer in fulfillment of the expectations,
spirit, and intent of this chapter, and that if approved as an authorizer, the
entity will fully participate in any authorizer training provided or required
by the State; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  A statement of assurance that the applicant will
ensure public accountability and transparency in all matters concerning its
charter-authorizing practices, decisions, and expenditures.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  By June 30 of each year, the board shall
decide whether to grant or deny chartering authority to each applicant.  The
board shall make its decisions on the merits of each applicant's proposal and
plans.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  Within sixty days of the board's decision,
the board shall execute a renewable authorizing contract with each entity it
has approved for chartering authority.  The initial term of each authorizing
contract shall be six years.  The authorizing contract shall specify each
approved entity's agreement to serve as an authorizer in accordance with the
expectations of this chapter, and shall specify additional performance terms
based on the applicant's proposal and plan for chartering.  No approved entity
shall commence charter authorizing without an authorizing contract in effect.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (h)  This section shall not apply to the
commission. [L 2012, c 130, pt of §2]</p>
