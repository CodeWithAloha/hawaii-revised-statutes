manufacturer indicating compliance with all applicable federal standards.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  The passengers of the following motor

this section if:</p>

to be equipped with a seat belt assembly under any federal motor vehicle safety
standard unless the vehicle is in fact equipped with a seat belt assembly;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The person not restrained by a seat belt assembly
is in a vehicle in which the number of persons exceeds the number of seat belt
assemblies available in the vehicle or the number of seat belt assemblies

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The person not restrained by a seat belt assembly
has a condition which prevents appropriate restraint by the seat belt assembly;
provided the condition is duly certified by a physician or a physician

the restraint is inappropriate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The person not restrained by a seat belt assembly
