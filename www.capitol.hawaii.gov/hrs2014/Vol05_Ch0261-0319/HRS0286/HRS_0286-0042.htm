<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §286-42  County finance director's duties.</b> 
(a)  The county director of finance shall examine and to the best of the
director's ability determine the genuineness and regularity of every
registration and transfer of registration of a vehicle pursuant to this part to
ensure that every certificate issued for a vehicle contains true statements of
the ownership of the vehicle and to prevent the registration of a vehicle by
any person not entitled to the vehicle.  The director of finance may require
any applicant to furnish information, in addition to that contained in the
application, that is necessary to satisfy the director of finance of the truth
and regularity of the application.  The director of finance may accept any
county certificate of title issued for a vehicle as prima facie evidence of
ownership for registration and transfer of registration.  The director may
issue vehicle identification numbers for reconstructed vehicles, special
interest vehicles, or motorcycles that do not have vehicle identification
numbers if the director determines that the requirements of this section have
been met.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The county director of finance may register a
motorcycle with an aftermarket motorcycle frame, using the number of the frame
as issued by the manufacturer of the frame, the vehicle identification number
on the certification label, or a vehicle identification number assigned by the
director of finance.  A bill of sale and Manufacturer's Statement of Origin for
the frame, engine, and transmission must be presented and retained as a part of
the permanent county registration records.  If a Manufacturer's Statement of
Origin is not available for the engine and transmission due to the use of a
used or reconstructed engine, transmission, or both, then a bill of sale or other
proof of ownership, satisfactory to the director of finance must be presented. 
Except for motorcycles that are built on an aftermarket motorcycle frame,
special interest vehicles, and reconstructed vehicles, any motor vehicle or
device that is not certified by the manufacturer to be in compliance with all
applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards as of the date of
[manufacture] shall not be registered.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  For the purpose of registering standard
makes and body types of new passenger motor vehicles the director of finance
may accept the certificate of any licensed motor vehicle dealer certifying to
the weight and identification of such vehicle.  The director of finance of any
county may accept the certificate of the director of finance of any other
county as to weight and identification of any such vehicle.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The director of finance may enter into a
contract with new car dealerships and motor vehicle rental companies for the
registration of new motor vehicles consistent with any statute, ordinance, or
provision of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.  The director of
finance may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 as may be necessary for the
application, bonding, and procedural requirements of such contractor.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  In the event the director of finance is
not satisfied as to the ownership of any vehicle sought to be registered,
unless the applicant presents satisfactory evidence to the director of finance
of the applicant's ownership of the vehicle and as to any liens thereon, the
director of finance may accept from the applicant a bond in such form as may be
determined by the director of finance in an amount equal to the retail value of
the vehicle.  The bond and the deposit thereof shall be conditioned to protect
the director of finance and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle or person
acquiring any lien thereon or the successor in interest of any such person
against any loss or damage on account of any defect in or undisclosed
encumbrance upon the right, title, and interest of the applicant in and to the
vehicle.  Any such interested person shall have a right of action to recover on
any such bond for any breach of the conditions for which the same was
deposited.  The aggregate liability of the surety to all such persons shall in
no event exceed the amount of the bond and interest thereon, plus a reasonable
attorney's fee to be allowed by the court incurred to procure the recovery
under the bond.  The bond shall (unless suit has been instituted thereon) be
returned and surrendered at the end of three years.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  The county finance director, upon being
notified by the designated county department that a vehicle is a special
interest vehicle or that a vehicle has been inspected and approved as a
reconstructed vehicle, shall cause that fact to be shown upon the registration
and title certificates for that vehicle. [L 1929, c 197, §2; RL 1935, §2666; RL
