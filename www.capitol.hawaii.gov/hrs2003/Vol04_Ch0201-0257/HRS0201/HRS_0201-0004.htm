<P>&#9;The contracts shall be approved in writing by the department and shall specify the name of the contractor, the nature of the work to be performed, the manner in which funds may be expended, and such data as the state comptroller may require.</P>
<P>&#9;When necessary to effectuate the purposes of this part, funds to state agencies may authorize expenditures for the purchase of machinery and equipment and the erection and conversion of structures, laboratories, and buildings within the State, which facilities shall be and remain under the jurisdiction of the agencies.  Private agencies, associations, firms, or individuals shall provide all structures and equipment necessary to effectuate the purposes of funds made to them, in which cases the value which may be attributed to the use of the facilities shall be considered as matching funds.  The department shall retain under its own jurisdiction only such furniture, office equipment, and other equipment as is necessary for administration purposes.</P>
