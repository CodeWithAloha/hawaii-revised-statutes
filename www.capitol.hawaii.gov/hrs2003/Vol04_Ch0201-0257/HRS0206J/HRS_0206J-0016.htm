Any right, title, and interest of the development corporation in any project shall also be exempt from all state and county taxation.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the interest of a qualified person or other user of a project under a lease or other agreements related to a project shall not be exempt from taxation to a greater extent than it would be if the costs of the project were directly financed by the qualified person or other user.
