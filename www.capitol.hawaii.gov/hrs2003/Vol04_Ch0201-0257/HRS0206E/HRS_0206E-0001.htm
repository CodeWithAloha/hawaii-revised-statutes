<P>&#9;<B>§206E-1  Findings and purpose.</B>  The legislature finds that many areas of the State are substantially undeveloped, blighted, or economically depressed, and are or are potentially in need of renewal, renovation, or improvement to alleviate such conditions as dilapidation, deterioration, age, and other such factors or conditions which make such areas an economic or social liability.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature further finds that there exists within the State vast, unmet community development needs.  These include,  but are not limited to, a lack of suitable affordable housing; insufficient commercial and industrial facilities for rent; residential areas which do not have facilities necessary for basic liveability, such as parks and open space; and areas which are planned for extensive land allocation to one, rather than mixed uses.</P>
<P>&#9;It is further determined that the lack of planning and coordination in such areas has given rise to these community development needs and that existing laws and public and private mechanisms have either proven incapable or inadequate to facilitate timely redevelopment and renewal.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature finds that a new and comprehensive authority for community development must be created to join the strengths of private enterprise, public development and regulation into a new form capable of long-range planning and implementation of improved community development.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish such a mechanism in the Hawaii community development authority, a public entity which shall determine community development programs and cooperate with private enterprise and the various components of federal, state, and county governments in bringing plans to fruition.  For such areas designated as community development districts, the legislature believes that the planning and implementation program of the Hawaii community development authority will result in communities which serve the highest needs and aspirations of Hawaii's people.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature finds that the creation of the Hawaii community development authority, the establishment of community development districts, and the issuance of bonds pursuant to this chapter to finance public facilities serve the public interest and are matters of statewide concern.
