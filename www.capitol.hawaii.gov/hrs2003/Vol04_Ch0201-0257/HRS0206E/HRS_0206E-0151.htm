</B>
<P>&#9;<B>§206E-151  Findings and declarations.</B>  The legislature finds and declares that the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the State require that every opportunity be taken to assist the redevelopment of community development districts; that the redevelopment and revitalization of these districts will alleviate community needs for employment, housing, parks, open space, and commercial and industrial facilities; that a significant deterrent to redevelopment is the cost of public facilities; that interest rates on moneys necessary to finance such public facilities add significantly to the cost of such facilities and that more favorable interest rates would be available through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds; and that the availability of revenue bonds to finance the cost of public facilities will facilitate redevelopment of community development districts.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature further finds that the powers conferred, the issuance of revenue bonds, and the expenditure of public moneys under this part constitute a serving of a valid public purpose, and that this enactment is in the public interest and is so declared as an express legislative determination.
