</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;"Solar or wind energy system" means any identifiable facility, equipment, apparatus, or the like that converts insolation or wind energy to useful thermal or electrical energy for heating, cooling, or reducing the use of other types of energy that are dependent upon fossil fuel for their generation.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The dollar amount of any new federal energy tax credit similar to the credit provided in this section that is established after June 30, 2003, and any utility rebate, shall be deducted from the cost of the qualifying system and its installation before applying the state tax credit.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  The director of taxation shall prepare any forms that may be necessary to claim a tax credit under this section, including forms identifying the technology type of each tax credit claimed under this section, whether for solar thermal, photovoltaic from the sun, or wind.
