If section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code is repealed or terminated prior to January 1, 2006, its provisions shall remain in effect for purposes of the income tax law of the State as modified by this section, as provided for in subsection (h).</P>

<P>&#9;(c)  There shall be allowed to each taxpayer, subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, an income tax credit for qualified research activities equal to the credit for research activities provided by section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code and as modified by this section.  The credit shall be deductible from the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.</P>

<P>&#9;(f)  All claims for a tax credit under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to properly claim the credit shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.</P>
