<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§583A-207]  Inconvenient forum.  </B>(a)  A court of this State which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child-custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.  The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon the motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this State shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction.  For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The length of time the child has resided outside this State;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The distance between the court in this State and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The relative financial circumstances of the parties;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;</P>
<P>&#9;(7)&#9;The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence;</P>
<P>&#9;(8)&#9;The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation; and</P>
<P>&#9;(9)&#9;The physical and psychological health of the parties.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  If a court of this State determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  A court of this State may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding, while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding. [L 2002, c 124, pt of §2]</P>
