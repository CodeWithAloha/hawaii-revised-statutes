<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§583A-208]  Jurisdiction declined by reason of conduct.  </B>(a)  Except as otherwise provided in section 583A-204, if a court of this State has jurisdiction under this chapter because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203 determines that this State is a more appropriate forum under section 583A-207; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in sections 583A-201 to 583A-203.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  If a court of this State declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a), it may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child-custody proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a), it may assess against the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication expenses, attorney's fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses, and child care during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees are sought is a protective parent fleeing abuse, or the assessment would be clearly inappropriate.  The court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against this State unless authorized by law other than this chapter. [L 2002, c 124, pt of §2]</P>
