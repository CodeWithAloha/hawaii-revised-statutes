<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§586-4  Temporary restraining order.</B>  (a)  Upon petition to a family court judge, an ex parte temporary restraining order may be granted without notice to restrain either or both parties from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing each other, notwithstanding that a complaint for annulment, divorce, or separation has not been filed.  The order may be granted to any person who, at the time the order is granted, is a family or household member as defined in section 586-1 or who filed a petition on behalf of a family or household member.  The order shall enjoin the respondent or person to be restrained from performing any combination of the following acts:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Contacting, threatening, or physically abusing the protected party;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Contacting, threatening, or physically abusing any person residing at the protected party's residence; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Entering or visiting the protected party's residence.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  For any person who is alleged to be a family or household member by virtue of a dating relationship, the court may consider the following factors in determining whether a dating relationship exists:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The length of the relationship;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The nature of the relationship; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The frequency of the interaction between the parties.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  The family court judge may issue the ex parte temporary restraining order orally, if the person being restrained is present in court.  The order shall state that there is probable cause to believe that a past act or acts of abuse have occurred, or that threats of abuse make it probable that acts of abuse may be imminent.  The order further shall state that the temporary restraining order is necessary for the purposes of:  preventing acts of abuse or preventing a recurrence of actual domestic abuse; and ensuring a period of separation of the parties involved.  The order shall describe in reasonable detail the act or acts sought to be restrained.  Where necessary, the order may require either or both of the parties involved to leave the premises during the period of the order, and also may restrain the party or parties to whom it is directed from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing the applicant's family or household members.  The order shall not only be binding upon the parties to the action, but also upon their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, or any other persons in active concert or participation with them.  The order shall enjoin the respondent or person to be restrained from performing any combination of the following acts:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Contacting, threatening, or physically abusing the protected party;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Contacting, threatening, or physically abusing any person residing at the protected party's residence; or</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Entering or visiting the protected party's residence.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  When a temporary restraining order is granted and the respondent or person to be restrained knows of the order, a knowing or intentional violation of the restraining order is a misdemeanor.  A person convicted under this section shall undergo domestic violence intervention at any available domestic violence program as ordered by the court.  The court additionally shall sentence a person convicted under this section as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;For a first conviction for violation of the temporary restraining order, the person shall serve a mandatory minimum jail sentence of forty-eight hours and be fined not less than $150 nor more than $500; provided that the court shall not sentence a defendant to pay a fine unless the defendant is or will be able to pay the fine; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;For the second and any subsequent conviction for violation of the temporary restraining order, the person shall serve a mandatory minimum jail sentence of thirty days and be fined not less than $250 nor more than $1,000; provided that the court shall not sentence a defendant to pay a fine unless the defendant is or will be able to pay the fine.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;Upon conviction and sentencing of the defendant, the court shall order that the defendant immediately be incarcerated to serve the mandatory minimum sentence imposed; provided that the defendant may be admitted to bail pending appeal pursuant to chapter 804.  The court may stay the imposition of the sentence if special circumstances exist.</P>
<P>&#9;The court may suspend any jail sentence, except for the mandatory sentences under paragraphs (1) and (2), upon condition that the defendant remain alcohol and drug-free, conviction-free, or complete court-ordered assessments or intervention.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the discretion of the judge to impose additional sanctions authorized in sentencing for a misdemeanor.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Any fines collected pursuant to subsection (d) shall be deposited into the spouse and child abuse special account established under section 601-3.6. [L 1982, c 123, pt of §2; am L 1985, c 136, §2; am L 1987, c 315, §2; am L 1992, c 290, §2; am L 1998, c 172, §2; am L 1999, c 200, §1; am L 2000, c 186, §4]</P>
