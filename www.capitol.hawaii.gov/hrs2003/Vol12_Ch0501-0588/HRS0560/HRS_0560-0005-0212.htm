A guardian of the person may petition for permission to resign.  A petition for removal or for permission to resign may, but need not, include a request for appointment of a successor guardian of the person. </P>
<P>&#9;(b)  After notice and hearing on a petition for removal or for permission to resign, the family court may terminate the guardianship and make any further order that may be appropriate. &#9;(c)  If, at any time in the proceeding, the family court determines that the interests of the ward are, or may be, inadequately represented, it shall appoint an attorney to represent the minor, giving consideration to the preference of the minor if the minor is fourteen or more years of age.
