<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§507-70]  Self-storage contracts.</B>  (a)  Each contract for the rental or lease of individual storage space in a self-service storage facility shall be in writing and shall contain, in addition to the provisions otherwise required or permitted by law to be included, a statement that the occupant's property will be subject to a claim of lien and may be sold to satisfy the lien if the rent or other charges due remain unpaid for fifteen consecutive days and that such actions are authorized by this part.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  This part shall not apply, and the lien authorized by this part shall not attach, unless the rental agreement or supporting documentation requests, and provides space for, the occupant to give the name and address of another person to whom notices required to be given under this part may be sent.  If both an address and an alternative address are provided by the occupant, notices pursuant to sections 507-63 or 507-64 shall be sent to both addresses.  If both addresses are provided by the occupant, the owner shall send the final demand and notice of sale, pursuant to section 507-65, to both addresses by certified mail, postage prepaid.  Failure of an occupant to provide an alternative address shall not affect an owner's remedies under this part or under any other provision of law. [L 1984, c 239, pt of §1]</P>
