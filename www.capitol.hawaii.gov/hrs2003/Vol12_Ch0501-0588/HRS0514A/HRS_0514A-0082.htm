<P>&#9;(11)&#9;Associations at their own expense shall provide all board members with a current copy of the association's declaration, bylaws, house rules, and, annually, a copy of this chapter with amendments.</P>
<P>&#9;(12)&#9;The directors may expend association funds, which shall not be deemed to be compensation to the directors, to educate and train themselves in subject areas directly related to their duties and responsibilities as directors; provided that the approved annual operating budget shall include these expenses as separate line items.  These expenses may include registration fees, books, videos, tapes, other educational materials, and economy travel expenses.
