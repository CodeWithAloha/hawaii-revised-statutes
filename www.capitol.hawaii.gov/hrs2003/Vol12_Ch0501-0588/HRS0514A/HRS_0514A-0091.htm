However, any such grantor or grantee is entitled to a statement from the manager or board of directors setting forth the amount of the unpaid assessments against the grantor, and except as to the amount of subsequently dishonored checks mentioned in such statement as having been received within the thirty-day period immediately preceding the date of such statement, the grantee is not liable for, nor is the apartment conveyed subject to a lien for, any unpaid assessments against the grantor in excess of the amount therein set forth.
