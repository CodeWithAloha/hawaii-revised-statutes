No provision shall be made for amortization of bond premiums or for accumulation for discount.  The proceeds of sale, redemption, or other disposition of the bonds or obligations are principal. </P>
<P>&#9;(b)  The increment in value of a bond or other obligation for the payment of money payable at a future time in accordance with a fixed schedule of appreciation in excess of the price at which it was issued is distributable as income.  The increment in value is distributable to the beneficiary who was the income beneficiary at the time of increment from the first principal cash available or, if none is available, when realized by sale, redemption, or other disposition.  Whenever unrealized increment is distributed as income but out of principal, the principal shall be reimbursed for the increment when realized. [L 1973, c 200, pt of §1]</P>
