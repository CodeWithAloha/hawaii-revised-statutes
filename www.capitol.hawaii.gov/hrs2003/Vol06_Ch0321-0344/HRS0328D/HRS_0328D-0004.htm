<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§328D-4]  Source water monitoring.</B>  (a)  The plant operator shall be responsible for sampling and analysis of all approved sources for the contaminants specified in section 328D-2 to assure that product water derived from approved sources continues to comply with section 328D-2.  Such monitoring shall be at least annually, except that analysis for microbiological contaminants shall be weekly if the source is other than a public water system.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Approved sources shall be monitored every four years for contaminants for which the EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the department, or other government agency or agencies having jurisdiction requires source water monitoring.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  In lieu of source monitoring required by this section, a plant operator using a public water system as its source may obtain and display a certificate from the public water system demonstrating that the public water system conducts the monitoring required by this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Where a bottled water plant operator, water dealer, or regulatory agency knows or has reason to believe that a contaminant not otherwise monitored is present in the source water because of a spill, release of a hazardous substance, or otherwise, and its presence would create a potential health hazard to consumers, the plant operator or water dealer upon receipt of such information shall monitor the source water for the contaminant.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Detection of any contaminant in source monitoring required pursuant to this section shall be followed immediately by a program of periodic monitoring to confirm the presence in the source water of the contaminant.  If the listed unregulated contaminant is confirmed to be present in the source water at a concentration that exceeds a published EPA health advisory, or an FDA or department or other government agency action level for drinking water, the plant operator or water dealer shall employ appropriate treatment techniques to remove or to reduce the contaminant in the product water below the concentration and shall employ a program of periodic monitoring for the contaminant in the source water until such time as the contaminant is not detectable in the source water.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  The required source water sampling shall be performed by qualified personnel and required analysis shall be performed by an approved laboratory.  Records of the required sampling and analyses shall be maintained on file at the plant for not less than two years and shall be available for official review upon request of the department or other government agency or agencies having jurisdiction.
