<P>  Department notice sent under subsection (a)(1) by regular mail was not considered commencement of an action for penalties.  891 F. Supp. 1389.</P>
<P>  Hawaii laws relevant to citizens' enforcement action (brought under section of Clean Water Act), which required it to provide only violators with notice and an opportunity to be heard on pre-final decisions, failed to establish public's right to early information and intervention; Hawaii law was not sufficiently "comparable" to Clean Water Act to allow preemption of plaintiff's lawsuit.  904 F. Supp. 1098.</P>
