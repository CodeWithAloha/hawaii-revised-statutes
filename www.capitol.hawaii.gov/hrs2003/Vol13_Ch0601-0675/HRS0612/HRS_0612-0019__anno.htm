<P>  It is the right of defendant to have jury drawn from jurors duly summoned, until the array is exhausted by challenges.  3 H. 154, 165; 7 H. 352.  In the absence of a law saying when jurors should be summoned, held that they should be summoned within a reasonable time before the term.  4 H. 439.  Where a venire for named persons selected under the statute was issued and also an open venire, with oral order to summon the same persons, it is immaterial whether the latter was invalid or whether an open venire could issue at all under our statutes, if the venire under the statute was valid.  15 H. 602, 604.</P>
