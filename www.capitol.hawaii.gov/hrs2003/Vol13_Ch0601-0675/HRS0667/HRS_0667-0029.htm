The highest bidder who meets the requirements of the terms and conditions of the public sale shall be the successful bidder.  The public sale shall be considered as being held when the mortgaged property is declared by the foreclosing mortgagee as being sold to the successful bidder.  When the public sale is held, the successful bidder at the public sale, as the purchaser, shall make a nonrefundable downpayment to the foreclosing mortgagee of not less than ten per cent of the highest successful bid price.  If the successful bidder is the foreclosing mortgagee or any other mortgagee having a recorded lien on the mortgaged property before the recordation of the notice of default under section 667-23, the downpayment requirement may be satisfied by offset and a credit bid up to the amount of the mortgage debt.<B> </B>[L 1998, c 122, pt of §1]</P>
