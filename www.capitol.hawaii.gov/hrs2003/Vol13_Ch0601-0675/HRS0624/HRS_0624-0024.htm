Except as otherwise provided, the deposition shall be taken and may be used in the same manner as is provided by the rules of court relating to depositions in civil actions in circuit courts.</P>
<P>&#9;Nothing herein contained limits or affects any other power heretofore or hereafter conferred with respect to the taking of depositions. [L 1972, c 143, §1(a)]</P>
