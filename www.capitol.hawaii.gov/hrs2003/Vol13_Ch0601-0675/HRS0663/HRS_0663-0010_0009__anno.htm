<P>  State properly held jointly and severally liable under paragraph (4) as a "prior occurrence" need not be identical or exactly similar to put State on "reasonable prior notice"; it was enough that the State knew of the particular defective guardrail, had an opportunity to correct it, and failed to do so.  91 H. 60, 979 P.2d 1086.</P>
<P>  Section does not abolish joint and several liability for actions involving intentional torts; condominium association and murderer were thus jointly and severally liable to plaintiffs for noneconomic as well as economic damages, subject to reduction proportional to victim's assigned negligence.  87 H. 273 (App.), 954 P.2d 652.</P>

<B><P>Prior law.</P>
</B><P>  Joint and several liability imposed on asbestos manufacturers in products liability action.  960 F.2d 806.</P>
