</B>
<P>  This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 612, except that the federal rule begins with the phrase, "Except as otherwise provided in criminal proceedings by section 3500 of title 18, United States Code," and this phrase is omitted here as inappropriate.  The Advisory Committee's Note to Fed. R. Evid. 612 points out that "[t]he purpose of the rule is...to promote the search of credibility and memory."</P>
<P>  This rule restates existing Hawaii law found in State v. Altergott, 57 H. 492, 503, 559 P.2d 728, 736 (1977), where the court observed:  "A writing which is used to refresh the recollection of a witness, it is said by Wigmore, differs from a record of past recollection in being in no strict sense evidence, so that the offering party has no right to have the jury see it although the opponent may show it to the jury and the jury may demand it."  In other words, the writing used to refresh memory is not evidence, and therefore does not present hearsay problems, because, after refreshing, the witness testifies from present memory, and the writing serves merely as a jog to present memory.  If the witness has no present memory, as in the case where the attempt to refresh under this rule is unsuccessful, then the admissibility of the writing is governed by hearsay doctrine (especially Rule 802.1(4), "Past recollection recorded") and the authentication and original document requirements of Articles IX and X.</P>

</B>
<P>  Officer had sufficient personal knowledge, under rule 602, of intoxilyzer test officer administered to defendant and was thus competent to testify as to test results; when officer could not remember exact reading of test result, it was proper under this rule for State to allow officer to review defendant's test result report and refresh officer's present recollection of defendant's exact score.  95 H. 409 (App.), 23 P.3d 744.</P>
