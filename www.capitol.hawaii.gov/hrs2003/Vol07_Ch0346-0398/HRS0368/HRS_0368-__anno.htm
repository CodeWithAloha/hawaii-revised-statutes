<P>  Section 368 [sic], which was quite similar to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), found to be the most "analogous" state statute regarding applicable limitations period for plaintiff's ADA claim; since statutory period of ninety days was appropriately "borrowed" and became part of plaintiff's ADA claim, and since plaintiff filed suit within this time period, plaintiff's claim was not time-barred under ADA limitations period; passenger ticket contract did not trump applicable state law and ADA limitations periods.  51 F. Supp. 2d 1057.</P>
