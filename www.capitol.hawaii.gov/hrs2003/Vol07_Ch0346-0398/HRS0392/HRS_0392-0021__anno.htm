<P>  If an individual is employed by department as both a full-time teacher and an A+ employee and the individual becomes disabled for both jobs, department must pay the individual under both the full-time teacher TDI plan and the A+ TDI plan in order to compensate the individual for lost wages from both full-time teacher and A+ employments, because subsection (b) states that "the computation and distribution of benefit payments shall correspond to the greatest extent feasible, to the employee's wage loss due to the employee's disability".  Att. Gen. Op. 97-9.</P>
