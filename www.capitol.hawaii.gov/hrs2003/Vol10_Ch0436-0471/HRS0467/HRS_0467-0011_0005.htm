Failure to satisfy the continuing education requirement by the license expiration date shall result in the renewed license being automatically placed on an "inactive" status.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  To reactivate a license which has been placed on an "inactive" status, the licensee shall submit to the commission proof of having satisfied the continuing education requirement of this section, a complete application setting forth the information as may be prescribed or required by the commission, and payment of the proper fee.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No license shall be renewed if the license trade name, partnership, or corporation is not currently registered with the department of commerce and consumer affairs.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Upon submission of a renewal application, an individual real estate licensee, who holds a current, unencumbered real estate license in another state, or who holds a current, unencumbered real estate license in a jurisdiction recognized by the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials, with an equivalent real estate licensing law as determined by the commission, may request a determination of equivalency for the elective course hours of the continuing education requirement.  The equivalency shall be based on the successful completion of the continuing education requirements in the other state or jurisdiction prior to submission of the renewal application.  Approval of the equivalency shall be subject to the real estate licensee completing the commission-designated core course, as determined by the commission.
