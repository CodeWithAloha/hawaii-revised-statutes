<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§437B-15  Estimate for labor and parts.</B>  (a)  The motor vehicle repair dealer, mechanic, or apprentice shall give the customer a written estimated price for labor and parts necessary for a specific job prior to commencement of the job.  Such written estimated price need not be given if waived in writing by the customer.  No charge in excess of fifteen per cent of the estimated price, if the estimated price is less than $100, or ten per cent of the estimated price, if the estimated price is in excess of $100, shall be charged for parts and labor supplied in excess of the estimated price, without the prior written or oral consent of the customer.  Such consent shall be obtained at some time after it is determined that the estimated price is insufficient and before the labor not estimated is performed or the parts not estimated are supplied.  This provision may be waived in writing by the customer, provided that such waiver by its terms shall be effective only after the dealer or mechanic has made reasonable efforts to contact the customer.  The form and content of any waiver shall be as prescribed by rule of the board.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a motor vehicle repair dealer, mechanic, or apprentice to give a written estimated price if the dealer, mechanic, or apprentice does not agree to perform the requested service.  A reasonable fee may be charged for making the estimate.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  If any crash parts manufactured by anyone other than the original vehicle equipment manufacturer are to be supplied or installed, the estimate shall clearly state that fact and identify each of those crash parts.  In identifying the crash parts which are not manufactured by the original vehicle equipment manufacturer, the motor vehicle repair dealer, mechanic, or apprentice may include information on any applicable manufacturer's warranty and information about the part's compliance with any certified testing program.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  No motor vehicle repair dealer, mechanic, or apprentice shall use crash parts which are not manufactured or supplied by the original vehicle equipment manufacturer unless the owner of the motor vehicle accepts the use of such parts and signs the estimate acknowledging the use and source of the crash parts.
