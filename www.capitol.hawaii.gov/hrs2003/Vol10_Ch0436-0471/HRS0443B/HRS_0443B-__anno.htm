<P>  Plaintiff not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim under §480-13, as plaintiff failed to establish that plaintiff was actually damaged by defendant's failure to register as a debt collector.  183 F. Supp. 2d 1234.</P>
<P>  Designation of the director to enforce this chapter does not preclude standing to an individual to sue under chapter 480, provided the individual can satisfy the definition of "consumer"; circuit court's conclusion that plaintiffs had no standing to sue for a chapter 443B violation because director was charged with enforcement of the chapter, was error.  78 H. 213 (App.), 891 P.2d 300.</P>
