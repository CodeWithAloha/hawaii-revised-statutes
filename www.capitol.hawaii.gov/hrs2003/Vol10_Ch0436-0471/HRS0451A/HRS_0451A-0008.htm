Where more than one office is operated by the licensee, duplicate certificates shall be issued by the department for posting at each location.  A thirty-day grace period shall be allowed after December 31, during which time licenses may be renewed upon payment of a restoration fee to the department.  After expiration of the grace period, the department may renew the certificates upon payment of a second restoration fee to the department.  No person who applies for renewal, whose license has expired, shall be required to submit to any examination as a condition to renewal; provided that the renewal application is made within two years from the date of expiration.
