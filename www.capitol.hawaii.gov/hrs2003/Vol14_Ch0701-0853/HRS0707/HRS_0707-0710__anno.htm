<P>  Attempted assault.  56 H. 664, 548 P.2d 271.</P>
<P>  Expert medical testimony that "permanent, serious disfigurement" would have resulted absent medical attention irrelevant and improperly admitted where that result was an element of the offense charged under this section.  80 H. 126, 906 P.2d 612.</P>
<P>  Insufficient evidence to convict defendant under this section where evidence in record describing victim's scar only established that it was located on forehead, was two inches in length, and was visible from a "normal social" distance.  80 H. 126, 906 P.2d 612.</P>
