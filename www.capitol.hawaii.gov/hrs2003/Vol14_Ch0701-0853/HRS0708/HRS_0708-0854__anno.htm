<P>  This section punishes the making or possession of (a) a device specifically adapted for forgery, which has no other significant use, and the character of which is known to the actor, or (b) a device which may be adapted to forgery, where the actor has an intent so to employ the article (or aid in its employment). </P>
<P>  Like the section dealing with possession of burglar's tools, this section provides a basis for police intervention at the inchoate or preparatory stage of criminal activity.  Note, however, that in order to establish the offense the prosecution must prove the requisite state of knowledge or intent.</P>
