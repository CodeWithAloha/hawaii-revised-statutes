<P>  Welfare fraud cases may be prosecuted under this section despite existence of §346-34.  61 H. 79, 595 P.2d 291.</P>
<P>  History of this section and §346-34 reveals no legislative intent to limit welfare fraud prosecutions to §346-34.  62 H. 364, 616 P.2d 193.</P>
<P>  Where there is a single intention, general impulse, and plan, there is only one offense even though there is a series of transactions.  62 H. 364, 616 P.2d 193.</P>
<P>  Substantial direct and circumstantial evidence existed from which jury could have convicted defendant of theft in the first degree by extortion.  64 H. 65, 637 P.2d 407.</P>
<P>  No irreconcilable conflict with unemployment fraud statute; State may proceed under either.  67 H. 406, 689 P.2d 753.</P>
<P>  Not a lesser included offense of fraudulent use of a credit card.  70 H. 434, 774 P.2d 888.</P>
<P>  In order to convict a defendant of theft in the second degree, in violation of §708-830(8)(a) and subsection (1)(b), the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to steal property or services valued in excess of $300.  90 H. 359, 978 P.2d 797.</P>
<P>  Where defendant testified that defendant harbored no belief at all regarding the value of the stolen property, §708-801(5) could not afford defendant a mitigating defense to second degree theft under subsection (1)(b).  90 H. 359, 978 P.2d 797.</P>
<P>  Valuation of stolen goods; airline tickets.  1 H. App. 644, 623 P.2d 898.</P>
<P>  Evidence of moneys wrongfully converted, constituting violation of subsection (1)(b).  1 H. App. 658, 624 P.2d 381.</P>
