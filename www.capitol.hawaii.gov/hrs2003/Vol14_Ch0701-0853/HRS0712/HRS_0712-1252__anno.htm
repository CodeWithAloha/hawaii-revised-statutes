</B>
<P>  Much of the difficulty in proving possession of a dangerous drug, harmful drug or detrimental drug when the substance is found in a motor vehicle is also present in proving mens rea with respect to (1) the character, nature, or quantity of the substance possessed, dispensed, or sold, and (2) the transferee's status as a minor.  In cases involving offenses defined in this part, direct evidence, on these issues, such as self- incriminating statements, are rare.  Section 712-1252 provides an evidentiary rule analogous to that found in §712-1216 (relating to obscenity offenses).  It permits the prosecution to get its case before the trier of fact on issues where direct evidence is difficult to obtain, but it does not change the prosecution's burden of proof.</P>

<P>  Act 122, Session Laws 1984, amended this section to include intoxicating liquor in regard to prima facie evidence of knowledge of character, nature, or quantity of substance, or age of transferee because of the creation of a new offense of promoting intoxicating liquor to a minor.</P>
<P>  Act 207, Session Laws 1992, removed the repeal date of Act 342, Session Laws of Hawaii 1986, to permanently raise the minimum drinking age to twenty-one.  Conference Committee Report No. 9.</P>
