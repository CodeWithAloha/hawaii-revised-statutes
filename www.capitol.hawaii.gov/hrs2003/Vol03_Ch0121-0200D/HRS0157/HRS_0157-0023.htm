<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Project the reasonable expenditures necessary to administer the chapter for the license year;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Project the amount to be paid by applicants for original or renewal licenses for the license year;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Project the reasonable expenditures necessary to conduct an independent monthly audit;</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Estimate the total volume of milk to be produced and processed for the license year;</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;Using (1), (2), (3), and (4) above, establish a reasonable rate per hundred-weight or other unit as determined by the board; and</P>
<P>&#9;(6)&#9;Collect such fees monthly, or at such other intervals as may be determined by the board, during the license year based on actual milk produced and processed.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;To facilitate the collection of license fees, the board may require a producer-distributor or distributor to withhold from any payment owing to any producer a part or all of the license fee due under this chapter by such producer.  For any such withholding required by the board, the producer-distributor or distributor shall be paid a reasonable fee by the board.  The amount of the fee shall be set by the board.  An agricultural cooperative all of whose producer-members have complied with the licensing provisions of this chapter shall be exempt from the payment of the license fee.
