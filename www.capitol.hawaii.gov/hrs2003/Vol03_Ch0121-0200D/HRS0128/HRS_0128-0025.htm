<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§128-25  Investigations and surveys.</B>  The governor may make investigations and surveys for the purpose of ascertaining facts to be used in administering this chapter, and in making the investigations and surveys may require the making or filing of schedules or statements, under oath or otherwise, may administer oaths, take evidence under oath, subpoena witnesses, make inspections, and require the production of books, papers, and records.  The circuit court of any circuit or judge thereof, may enforce by proper proceedings the making or filing of the schedules or statements, the attendance and testimony of any witness subpoenaed to appear within the circuit, or the production of books, papers, and records.  The proceedings shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other means or methods of enforcement.</P>
<P>&#9;No person shall be excused from attending and testifying, or from producing books, papers, or records before the governor or in obedience to the subpoena of the governor, or in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, based upon or growing out of any alleged violation of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, on the ground, or for the reason, that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture; but no individual shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which the person is compelled after having claimed the person's privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, except that any individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.</P>
<P>&#9;Witnesses shall be allowed their fees and mileage as in cases in the circuit courts. [L 1951, c 268, pt of §2; RL 1955, §359-22; HRS §128-25; gen ch 1985]</P>
