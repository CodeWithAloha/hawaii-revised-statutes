<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§167-15]  State lands, formation of irrigation project.  </B>The board of agriculture may organize irrigation projects for lands under its control, whether or not the lands are occupied in whole or in part.  If the lands for which the proposed project is to be organized are not occupied or are occupied by persons whose rights to occupancy will expire before the project water will be supplied to the lands, no notice need be published nor public hearing held as in section 167-16 required.  The costs of construction of the project, shall be paid by the board, in the event and to the extent that the development and opening of the lands does not enable the making of acreage assessments sufficient to repay construction costs, from any funds in the state treasury derived from the lease or license of public lands or waters, which funds are hereby made available for such purposes. [L 1987, c 306, pt of §1]</P>
