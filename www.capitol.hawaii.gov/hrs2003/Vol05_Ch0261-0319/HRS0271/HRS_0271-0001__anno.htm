<P>  Public utilities commission adequately addressed the public policy considerations of this section, including any damage sustained by intervenor motor carriers or the public by virtue of bankrupt carrier not having utilized its certificate for several months, where, based upon evidence adduced, commission concluded that carriers that conducted operations during interruption of bankrupt carrier's service did not unfairly suffer adverse effects detrimental to the provision of adequate transportation services to the public.  93 H. 45, 995 P.2d 776.</P>
<P>  Where the public utilities commission acted within its prerogatives in treating bankrupt carrier's application as a request to permit other carriers to continue bankrupt carrier's existing service, and in doing so considered the public interest factors required under §271-18 and this section, §271-12 and the new service doctrine were inapposite to the case.  93 H. 45, 995 P.2d 776.</P>
