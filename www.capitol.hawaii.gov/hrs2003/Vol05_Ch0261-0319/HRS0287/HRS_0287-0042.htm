<P>&#9;(b)  The administrator may, in the administrator's discretion, upon the application of such a person, issue a certificate of self-insurance when the administrator is satisfied that the person is possessed and will continue to be possessed of ability to pay judgments obtained against such person.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  Upon not less than five days' notice and a hearing pursuant to the notice, the administrator may upon reasonable grounds cancel a certificate of self-insurance.  Failure to pay any judgment within thirty days after the judgment has become final shall constitute a reasonable ground for the cancellation of a certificate of self-insurance.
