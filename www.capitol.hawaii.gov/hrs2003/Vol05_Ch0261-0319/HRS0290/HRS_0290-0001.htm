A vehicle is "abandoned", for the purposes of this subsection, if it is defined to be abandoned by an ordinance of the county in which the vehicle is located; in the absence of such an ordinance, a vehicle is "abandoned" if it is left unattended for a continuous period of more than twenty-four hours and it is unlawfully parked on any public highway or other public property.  The mayors of the several counties may designate an agency within their counties to carry out the functions and requirements of this section.  The term "agency" means any office, department, or other governmental unit of the county.</P>
