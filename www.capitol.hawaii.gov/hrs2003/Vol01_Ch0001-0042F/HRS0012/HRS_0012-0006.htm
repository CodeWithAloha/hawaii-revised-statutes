<P>&#9;(1)&#9;For members of Congress, state, and county offices, nomination papers shall be filed with the chief election officer, or clerk in case of county offices, not later than 4:30 p.m. on the sixtieth calendar day prior to the primary, special primary, or special election provided that if such day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday then not later than 4:30 p.m. on the first working day immediately preceding.  A state candidate from the counties of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai may file the declaration of candidacy with the respective clerk.

However, if a special primary or special election is to be held by a county and the county charter requires that the council shall issue a proclamation calling for the election to be held within a specified period of time, and if that requirement would not allow the filing of nomination papers with the appropriate office by the sixtieth calendar day prior to the day for holding the special primary or special election, the council shall establish the deadline for the filing of nomination papers in the proclamation calling for the election; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;For the board of trustees for the office of Hawaiian affairs, nomination papers shall be filed with the chief election officer, not later than 4:30 p.m. on the sixtieth calendar day prior to the primary election referred to in paragraph (1); provided that if that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, then not later than 4:30 p.m. on the first working day immediately preceding.</P>
<P>&#9;[(b)]&#9;If after the close of filing there are no candidates who have filed nomination papers for an elective office for the primary, special primary, or any special election held in conjunction with the primary election, the chief election officer or clerk, in the case of a county election, shall accept nomination papers for that office not later than 4:30 p.m. on the fiftieth day prior to the primary, special primary, or special election.</P>
<P>&#9;[(c)]&#9;There shall be deposited with each nomination paper a filing fee on account of the expenses attending the holding of the primary, special primary, or special election which shall be paid into the treasury of the State, or county, as the case may be, as a realization:</P>

<P>&#9;[(e)]&#9;Upon the showing of a certified copy of an affidavit which has been filed with the campaign spending commission pursuant to section 11-208 by a candidate who has voluntarily agreed to abide by spending limits, the chief election officer or clerk shall discount the filing fee of the candidate by the following amounts:</P>
<P>&#9;(1)&#9;For the office of governor and lieutenant governor--$675;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;For the office of mayor--$450; and</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;For all other offices--$225.</P>
