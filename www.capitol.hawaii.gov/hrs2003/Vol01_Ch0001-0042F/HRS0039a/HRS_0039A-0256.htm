<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>[§39A-256]  Issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance projects.</B>  In addition to the other powers that it may otherwise have, the department may issue special purpose revenue bonds to finance or refinance the costs of facilities of or for project parties or to loan the proceeds of such bonds to assist project parties.  All revenue bonds issued under this part are special purpose revenue bonds, and the provisions of part III of chapter 39 shall not apply.  All special purpose revenue bonds shall be issued in the name of the department and not in the name of the State.</P>
<P>&#9;In determining the cost of any project, the department may also include the following: financing charges, fees, the expenses of trustees, and the cost of paying agents to issue special purpose revenue bonds to fund the project; interest on the bonds and the expenses of the State in connection with the bonds and the project to be financed or refinanced from the proceeds of the bonds accruing or incurred prior to and during the period of construction, not to exceed twelve months thereafter; amounts necessary to establish or increase reserves for the special purpose revenue bonds; the cost of plans, specifications, studies, surveys, and estimates of costs and of revenues; other expenses incidental to determining the feasibility or practicability of the project; administration expenses; the cost of interest incurred by the project party with respect to the project prior to the issuance of the special purpose revenue bonds; fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing of outstanding obligations; other costs, commissions, and expenses incidental to the construction, acquisition, reconstruction, renovation, rehabilitation, improvement, betterment, operation, or extension of the project; the financing or refinancing of the project and placing the project in operation; and the issuance of the special purpose revenue bonds, whether incurred prior to or after the issuance of such bonds.</P>
<P>&#9;The legislature finds and determines that the exercise of the powers vested in the department by this part constitutes assistance to not-for-profit private nonsectarian and sectarian elementary schools, secondary schools, colleges, and universities serving the general public and that the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance or refinance facilities of or for project parties or to loan the proceeds of the bonds to assist project parties is in the public interest.  The legislature also finds and determines that the exercise of the powers vested in the department by this part are pursuant to separate acts of the legislature, each of which shall be enacted in a nondiscriminatory manner on the basis of neutral, secular criteria and will not in any manner violate the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States or article I, section [4], of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii.
