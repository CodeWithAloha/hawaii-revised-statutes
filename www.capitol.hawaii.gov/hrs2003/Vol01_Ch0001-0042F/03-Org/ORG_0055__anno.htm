<P>  Congress, from time to time, has ratified territorial bond acts and has authorized particular issues.  For the years 1933 to 1942 inclusive, see the Acts of July&nbsp;15, 1935, August&nbsp;3, 1935, May&nbsp;28, 1937, July&nbsp;10, 1937 (four Acts), May&nbsp;13, 1938, August&nbsp;7, 1939, November 21, 1941, and May&nbsp;5, 1942 cited in the Chronological Note of Acts Affecting Hawaii, RLH 1955, page 9; see also 48 U.S.C.A. 562a to j, and the list of loan fund acts in the appendix, note 6, RLH 1955, p. 1731.</P>
<P>  Before §55 was amended, a county could not issue bonds unless it had the power of taxation:  19 H. 9.  Legislation substantially lessening the security for payment of county bonds by reducing county revenue might be invalid as an impairment of contract obligations:  19 H. 17.  Limitation on indebtedness of municipality applies to indebtedness imposed by legislature on, as well as that incurred by, the municipality:  25 H. 335.  Street improvement bonds to be financed by assessments not municipal "indebtedness", 33 H. 731.</P>
<P>  For construction with reference to delegation of power, of bond statute which in terms was to take effect on the President's approval, see note to §50.</P>
<P>  Other territories:  Compare this §55 of the Org. Act with Rev. Sts., §§1851, 1889; 23 Stat 348; 24 Stat 170; 25 Stat 336; 29 Stat 136, covering similar subjects in relation to territories in general, all of which may have been by implication inapplicable to Hawaii before the amendment of §5 and were made inapplicable expressly by that amendment.  See note to §56.</P>
<P>  By this § full congressional legislative power within its terms was delegated to the territorial legislature, 54 F.2d 313.  While the power of Congress to legislate for a territory, directly or through a local legislature, is derived from the Constitution (195 U.S. 140), it is derived, not from the enumerated specific powers, but from the general power to make "needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States" or by implication from the power to acquire and hold territory and the fact that there is no other legislative power over such territory, or from both these sources (136 U.S. 42-44); (182 U.S. 290; 195 U.S. 140; 118 U.S. 380).  Hence such legislative power over territories is not subject to the limitations applicable to the power of Congress over the states, except as set forth in the note to §5 of this Act, but in general is the equivalent of the combined federal and state legislative power over a state and extends to "all rightful subjects of legislation."  175 U.S. 168; 239 U.S. 365; 137 U.S. 684; 152 U.S. 48; 201 U.S. 308; 251 U.S. 406; 171 Fed. 488; 86 Fed. 456.  Congress may abrogate territorial laws or legislate directly for the territories.  305 U.S. 306, affg. 96 F.2d 412, and 33 H. 890.</P>
<P>  Pursuant to section 73(c), certain land laws are not subject to repeal or amendment by the legislature without the approval of Congress.</P>
<P>  By the Act of April&nbsp;19, 1930, the Hawaii National Park was removed from territorial jurisdiction except for certain purposes therein stated.  This Act is set out following the U.S. Constitution.</P>
<P>  As to military and naval reservations see the note to section 2.  As to taxation see the following Acts of general application throughout the United States:  Act of June&nbsp;16, 1936 known as Hayden-Cartwright Act, c 582, §10, 49 Stat 1518, 1521, as amended October&nbsp;9, 1940, c 787, §7, 54 Stat 1059, 1060, construed in 38 Ops. 519; Act of October&nbsp;9, 1940, known as the Buck Act, c 787, 54 Stat 1059.</P>

<P>  As to application of Constitution see §5 and note.  Constitutional construction adopted, if possible, 36 H. 206, 230.</P>

<P>  The absence of legislation for licenses to clubs to sell liquor is no defense for a club selling without a license; 16 H. 509; nor has an ex-licensee such a vested right as will entitle him to sell his stock of liquor after the expiration of his license:  18 H. 406.
