Such a termination may be effected only if at least two-thirds of the members of the board of trustees indicate in writing their decision so to terminate.  If the board of trustees proposes to terminate a member, the member shall have the right to call a special meeting of all participating members for the purpose of voting on whether or not the member shall be so terminated.  The member shall not be terminated if at least two-thirds of the participating members present indicate that the member should not be terminated.  In the event a member is terminated, the person may elect either:</P><DIR>

However, in the event the interindemnity arrangement is then providing legal defense services to such person, the interindemnity arrangement shall continue to provide those services for a period of thirty days to enable such person to assume his or her own defense; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;To release all rights to the return of the initial contribution, in which case the indemnity coverage shall continue for the benefit of the member in respect of occurrences during the time the person was a participating member and the person shall have no responsibility for assessments levied following such termination.
