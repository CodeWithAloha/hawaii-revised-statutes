<P>  The note appearing at the end of this section in the main volume is amended by the following acts:  L Sp 1995, c 17, §7; L 1996, c 307, §9; L 1997, c 222; and L 1999, c 151, §2.</P>

<P>  "SECTION 10.  (a)  The director may establish a loan program to assist the Hawaii hurricane relief fund in carrying out the plan of operation, and may make loans to the Hawaii hurricane relief fund.  There is hereby created in the treasury of the State a separate and special fund to be designated as the hurricane bond loan fund of this Act.</P>
<P>  (b)  The department of budget and finance, with the approval of the governor, is authorized to issue in the name of the department revenue bonds at such times and in such amount or amounts not to exceed $200,000,000 in aggregate principal as may be requested and deemed necessary by the commissioner for the purposes of the Hawaii hurricane relief fund.  All such bonds shall be issued pursuant to part III of chapter 39, except as provided in this section.</P>
<P>  (c)  The resolution or certificate providing for the issuance of the bonds may provide that all or part of the proceeds may be held and invested in the hurricane bond loan fund until needed for the purposes of the Hawaii hurricane relief fund.  For the purposes of providing a source of revenue or security for these bonds, the director may pledge funds deposited or to be deposited in the hurricane bond loan fund to the payment or security of the bonds, and the pledge shall constitute a lien and security interest on the moneys in the hurricane bond loan fund to the extent and with the priority set forth in the document establishing the pledge, without the necessity for physical delivery, recording, or other further act.  No revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to this section unless the director of finance shall first make a determination based on information provided by the commissioner that there are sufficient revenues and other assets to pay debt service on the revenue bonds.</P>
<P>  (d)  The director of finance is authorized to issue reimbursable general obligation bonds in the principal amount of $200,000,000, or so much thereof as may be requested and deemed necessary by the commissioner for the purposes of the Hawaii hurricane relief fund, and the same sum is appropriated for fiscal year 1993-1994 for deposit into the hurricane reserve trust fund.  The commissioner, upon the commissioner's determination that it is advisable to transfer funds from the hurricane reserve trust fund, shall reimburse the state general fund for payment of debt service on general obligation bonds authorized and issued under this section.</P>
<P>  SECTION 11.  [Section repealed by L 1996, c 307, §9.]  The state supreme court shall have exclusive and original jurisdiction over any controversy or dispute regarding the financing of the Hawaii hurricane relief fund and the hurricane reserve trust fund through the issuance of revenue bonds or general obligation bonds, and the security provisions thereof and the imposition and collection of any rates and charges to repay or provide security for the bonds; provided that the jurisdiction be limited to the applicability of Article VII of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii to these matters."</P>
