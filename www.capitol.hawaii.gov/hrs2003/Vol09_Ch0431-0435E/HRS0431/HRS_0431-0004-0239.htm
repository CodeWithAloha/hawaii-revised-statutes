<P>&#9;(c)  A proxy may confer discretionary authority with respect to other matters which may come before the meeting; provided the persons on whose behalf the solicitation is made are not aware a reasonable time prior to the time the solicitation is made that any other matters are to be presented for action at the meeting and provided that a specific statement to that effect is made in the proxy statement or in the form of a proxy.</P>

<P>&#9;(e)  The proxy statement or form of proxy shall provide, subject to reasonable specified conditions, that the proxy will be voted and that where the person solicited specifies, by means of a ballot provided pursuant to subsection (b), a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the vote will be in accordance with the specification so made.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  The information included in the proxy statement shall be clearly presented and the statement made shall be divided into groups according to subject matter, with appropriate headings.  All printed proxy statements shall be clearly and legibly presented. [L 2000, c 24, pt of §2]</P>
