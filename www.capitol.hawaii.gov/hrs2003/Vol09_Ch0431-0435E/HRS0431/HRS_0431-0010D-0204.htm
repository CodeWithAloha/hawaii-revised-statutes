<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§431:10D-204  Labor union groups.</B>  The lives of a group of individuals may be insured under a policy issued to a labor union, which shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure members of the union for the benefit of persons other than the union or any of its officials, representatives or agents, subject to the following requirements:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The members eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the members of the union, or all of any class or classes thereof;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The premium for the policy shall be paid either wholly from the union's funds, or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance.  No policy may be issued on which the entire premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance.  A policy on which part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance may be placed in force only if at least seventy-five per cent of the then eligible members, excluding any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer, elect to make the required contributions.  Except as provided in item (3), a policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members, except those who reject such coverage in writing.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;An insurer may exclude or limit the coverage on any person as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;The policy must cover at least twenty-five members at date of issue.</P>
<P>&#9;(5)&#9;The amount of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the members or by the union. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</P>
