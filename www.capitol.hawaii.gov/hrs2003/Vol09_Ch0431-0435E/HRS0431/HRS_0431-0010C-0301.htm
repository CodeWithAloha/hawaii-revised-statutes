<P>&#9;(3)&#9;With respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, liability coverage provided therein or supplemental thereto, in limits for bodily injury or death set forth in paragraph (1), under provisions filed with and approved by the commissioner, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting therefrom; provided that the coverage required under this paragraph shall not be applicable where any named insured in the policy shall reject the coverage in writing; and</P>

<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;Be conspicuously displayed so as to be readily noticeable by the insured;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;Set forth the premium for the coverage adjacent to the offer in a manner that the premium is clearly identifiable with the offer and may be easily subtracted from the total premium to determine the premium payment due in the event the insured elects not to purchase the option; and</P>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;These offers are to be made when a motor vehicle insurance policy is first applied for or issued.
