This includes, but is not limited to, the commissioner's administrative authority to investigate, issue subpoenas, conduct depositions and hearings, issue orders, and impose penalties.  With regard to any investigation, administrative proceedings, or litigation, the commissioner may rely on the procedural law and rules of this State.  The injunctive authority of the commissioner in regard to risk retention groups shall be restricted by the requirement that any injunction be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
