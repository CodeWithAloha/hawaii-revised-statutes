Within two years from the date the commission obtains actual knowledge of the violation, the commission may institute a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect the civil penalty, the costs, and attorney's fees.  In the case of ongoing violation, the two-year period shall start from the date of the last violation.  The commission may refer any such action to the attorney general as it deems appropriate.

The commission may use data collected by the department of business, economic development, and tourism pursuant to chapter 486J, as well as obtain the assistance of that department in determining such compliance.</P>
<P>&#9;(k)  The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 as may be necessary to implement this section. [L 2002, c 77, pt of §2(1)]</P>
