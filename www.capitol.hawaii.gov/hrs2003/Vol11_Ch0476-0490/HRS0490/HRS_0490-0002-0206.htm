<P>&#9;(a)&#9;An offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances;</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;An order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods, but such a shipment of nonconforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(2)  Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance. [L 1965, c 208, §2-206; HRS §490:2-206]</P>
