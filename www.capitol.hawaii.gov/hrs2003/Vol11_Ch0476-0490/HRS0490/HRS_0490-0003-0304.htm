<P>&#9;(1)&#9;If the principal is payable in installments and a due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue upon default under the instrument for nonpayment of an installment, and the instrument remains overdue until the default is cured.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;If the principal is not payable in installments and the due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue on the day after the due date.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;If a due date with respect to principal has been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue on the day after the accelerated due date.</P></DIR>

</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  Unless the due date of principal has been accelerated, an instrument does not become overdue if there is default in payment of interest but no default in payment of principal. [L 1991, c 118, pt of §1]</P>
