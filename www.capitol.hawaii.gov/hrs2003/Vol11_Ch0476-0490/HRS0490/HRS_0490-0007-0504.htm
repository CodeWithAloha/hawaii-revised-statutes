<P>&#9;(2)  In the case of a nonnegotiable document, until but not after the bailee receives notification of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;(a)&#9;By those creditors of the transferor who could treat the sale as void under section 490:2-402; or</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;By a buyer from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the buyer or received notification of his rights; or</P>

<P>&#9;(3)  A diversion or other change of shipping instructions by the consignor in a nonnegotiable bill of lading which causes the bailee not to deliver to the consignee defeats the consignee's title to the goods if they have been delivered to a buyer in ordinary course of business and in any event defeats the consignee's rights against the bailee.</P>
<P>&#9;(4)  Delivery pursuant to a nonnegotiable document may be stopped by a seller under section 490:2-705, and subject to the requirement of due notification there provided.  A bailee honoring the seller's instructions is entitled to be indemnified by the seller against any resulting loss or expense. [L 1965, c 208, §7-504; HRS §490:7-504]</P>
