<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection.  Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(b)  For the purposes [of] subsection (a)(1):</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;The time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;The time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(c)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security interest under section 490:9-327, 490:9-328, 490:9-329, 490:9-330, or 490:9-331 also has priority over a conflicting security interest in:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Any supporting obligation for the collateral; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Proceeds of the collateral if:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(A)&#9;The security interest in proceeds is perfected;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(C)&#9;In the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral, or an account relating to the collateral.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;(d)  Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing.</P>
<P>&#9;(e)  Subsection (d) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights.</P>
<P>&#9;(f)  Subsections (a) through (e) are subject to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Subsection (g) and the other provisions of this part;</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Section 490:4-210 with respect to a security interest of a collecting bank;</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;Section 490:5-118 with respect to a security interest of an issuer or nominated person; and</P>
<P>&#9;(4)&#9;Section 490:9-110 with respect to a security interest arising under Article 2 or 2A.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
