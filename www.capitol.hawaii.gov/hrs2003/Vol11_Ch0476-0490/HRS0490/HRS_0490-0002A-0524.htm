<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Identify to the lease contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time the lessor learned of the default they were in the lessor's or the supplier's possession or control; and</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Dispose of goods (section 490:2A-527(a)) that demonstrably have been intended for the particular lease contract even though those goods are unfinished.</P></DIR>
