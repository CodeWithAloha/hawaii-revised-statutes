<P>&#9;(b)  A judge of a circuit court or of a district court may, upon application by the attorney general, or any county attorney, prosecuting attorney, or corporation counsel of any county or city and county, issue an order requiring the person to testify or to produce a record, document, or other object, notwithstanding the person's refusal to do so on the basis of the person's privilege against self-incrimination.  The application shall specify whether the immunity being sought is use immunity as set forth in section 480-23.2 or transactional immunity as set forth in section 480-23.3.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The order may be issued prior to the assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination but shall not be effective until the witness asserts the witness' privilege against self- incrimination and the presiding officer communicates the order to the witness.  The order shall specify the type of immunity being granted and contain appropriate explanation of the scope of protection from prosecution being afforded thereby.
