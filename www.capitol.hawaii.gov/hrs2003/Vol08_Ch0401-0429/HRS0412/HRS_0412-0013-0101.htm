<P>&#9;(b)  The provisions of this article shall apply to all agency and representative offices of foreign banks which were licensed under previous laws of this State and which are in operation on June&nbsp;1, 1997, except as provided in this section.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  With the enactment of this article, non-depository agency offices of foreign banks which were licensed under previous laws of this State and are in operation on June&nbsp;1, 1997, shall have all of the powers and authority of a Hawaii state agency under this article, except that the non-depository agency office shall not accept any deposits pursuant to section 412:13-208, and as long as deposits are not accepted, the non-depository agency office shall not be required to comply with section 412:13-213.
