<STRONG><P>&#9;[§425E-1001]  Direct action by a partner.</STRONG>  (a)  Subject to subsection (b), a partner may maintain a direct action against the limited partnership or another partner for legal or equitable relief, with or without an accounting as to the partnership's activities, to enforce the rights and otherwise protect the interests of the partner, including rights and interests under the partnership agreement or this chapter or arising independently of the partnership relationship.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  A partner commencing a direct action under this section shall be required to plead and prove an actual or threatened injury that is not solely the result of an injury suffered or threatened to be suffered by the limited partnership.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  The accrual of, and any time limitation on, a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law.  A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up shall not revive a claim barred by law. [L 2003, c 210, pt of §1]</P>
