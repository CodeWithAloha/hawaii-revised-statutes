<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&#9;<B>§103D-310  Responsibility of offerors.</B>  (a)  Unless the policy board, by rules, specifies otherwise, before submitting an offer, a prospective offeror, not less than ten calendar days prior to the day designated for opening offers, shall give written notice of the intention to submit an offer to the procurement officer responsible for that particular procurement.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)  Whether or not an intention to bid is required, the procurement officer shall determine whether the prospective offeror has the financial ability, resources, skills, capability, and business integrity necessary to perform the work.  For this purpose, the officer, in the officer's discretion, may require any prospective offeror to submit answers, under oath, to questions contained in a standard form of questionnaire to be prepared by the policy board.  Whenever it appears from answers to the questionnaire or otherwise, that the prospective offeror is not fully qualified and able to perform the intended work, a written determination of nonresponsibility of an offeror shall be made by the head of the purchasing agency, in accordance with rules adopted by the policy board.  The unreasonable failure of an offeror to promptly supply information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of nonresponsibility with respect to such offeror.  The decision of the head of the purchasing agency shall be final unless the offeror applies for administrative review pursuant to section 103D-709.</P>
<P>&#9;(c)  All offerors, upon award of contract, shall comply with all laws governing entities doing business in the State, including chapters 237, 383, 386, 392, and 393, and shall:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;(1)&#9;Be incorporated or organized under the laws of the State; or</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;Be registered to do business in the State as a separate branch or division that is capable of fully performing under the contract.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Offerors shall produce documents to the procuring officer to demonstrate compliance with this subsection.  Any offeror making a false affirmation or certification under this subsection shall be suspended from further offerings or awards pursuant to section 103D-702.</P>
<P>&#9;(d)  Information furnished by an offeror pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed to any person except to law enforcement agencies as provided by chapter 92F. [L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of §2; am L 1997, c 352, §§10, 23; am L 2003, c 52, §6]</P>
