<P>  Judges who are members of the employees' retirement system and who have credited service as a judge before July&nbsp;1, 1999, shall not have their benefits diminished or impaired.  L 1999, c 65, §11.</P>

<P>  Upon retirement, a member with service as a judge or an elected officer is entitled to have each year of such service computed at the 3-1/2% rate, regardless of the length of such service.  Att. Gen. Op. 72-19.</P>
<P>  Enhanced benefits of various law enforcement officers and firefighters, discussed.  Att. Gen. Op. 90-2.</P>
<P>  In general, the calculation of retirement benefits of elective officers who were elective officers on July 1, 1997, pursuant to Act 374, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997, should be made thus:  the law as it existed before the effective date of Act 374 (July 1, 1997) is applied to service accrued before the effective date of the Act (i.e., elective officers can apply a high average final compensation to years of possibly multiple types of services, including elective service) and the amount derived from that calculation is added to the amount arrived at by applying the Act to service accrued after the effective date of the Act (which is segregated by service category).  This results in using different average final compensations for pre- and post-Act service.  Att. Gen. Op. 2000-1.</P>
