permitted trustee, by means of a trust instrument, regardless of whether
consideration is exchanged.  In the case of a transfer to more than one
trustee, a disposition that is otherwise a permitted transfer shall not be

other than the transferor, who is a resident of this State or a bank or trust
company that is authorized to do business in this State, possesses and

administration of the trust.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Spouse&quot; means a person to whom the
transferor is married or with whom the person is party to a civil union at the
time of the permitted transfer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Transfer&quot; means the disposition,
conveyance, or assignment of property, including the change in the legal
ownership of property occurring upon the substitution of one trustee for
another or the addition of one or more new trustees, or the exercise of a power
that causes the disposition, conveyance, or assignment of permitted property to
a trustee or trustees, but shall not include the release or relinquishment of
an interest in property that was formerly the subject of a permitted transfer.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Transferor&quot; means:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  An owner of permitted property;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The holder of a power of appointment that

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  A trustee who directly or indirectly makes a
disposition of permitted property.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Trust instrument&quot; means an
irrevocable instrument appointing a permitted trustee or permitted trustees for
the permitted property that is the subject of a disposition.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Trustee&quot; includes an original,
additional, or successor trustee, whether or not appointed or confirmed by
court. [L 2010, c 182, pt of §2; am L 2011, c 161, §3]</p>
