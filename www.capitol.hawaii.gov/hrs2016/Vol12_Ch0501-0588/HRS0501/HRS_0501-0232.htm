connection with a future transfer of the property to a declarant or other
person imposing the deed restriction or covenant on the property or a third
party designated by a transferor of the property is prohibited.  A deed
restriction or other covenant running with the land that violates this section
or a lien purporting to encumber the land to secure a right under a deed
restriction or other covenant running with the land that violates this section
is void and unenforceable.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  This section shall not apply to the
following fees or charges required by a deed restriction or other covenant
running with the land in connection with the transfer of real property:</p>

payable by a borrower to a lender pursuant to a loan secured by real property,

applicable to such association or corporation, including a fee or charge to
change the association or corporation's records as to the owner of the real
property or to provide an estoppel letter or certificate;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any fee or charge payable to a lessor under a
lease of real property, including a fee or charge payable to the lessor for
consenting to an assignment of the lease, for providing an estoppel letter or

interest in the lease;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Any consideration payable to the holder of an
option to purchase an interest in real property or the holder of a right of
first refusal or first offer to purchase an interest in real property for
waiving, releasing, or not exercising the option or right upon transfer of the
real property to another person;</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (B)  A person who acquires the real property
for the purpose of engaging in the business of the development of real property
for resale to others or for the purpose of reselling the real property to a
person engaged in the business of the development of real property for resale
to others; or</p>

<p class=ASubparagraph>         (C)  A person who purchases real property
initially transferred at a price below the then prevailing market value of the
real property pursuant to an affordable housing program established by the
seller; provided that such fee, charge, shared appreciation interest, profit
participation, or other consideration becomes payable, if ever, within ten
years of the recording of the deed restriction or other covenant running with
the land imposing the fee or charge on the real property;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Any fee or charge payable to a government entity;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Any fee, charge, assessment, or other amount
payable pursuant to a deed restriction or other covenant running with the land,
regardless of when filed or recorded, that was required by a litigation
settlement that was approved by a court of competent jurisdiction before [June

on the restrictions imposed by the qualified real property interest granted
exclusively for a conservation purpose.</p>

<p class=1ParagraphContd>          As used in this paragraph, &quot;qualified

<p class=RegularParagraphs>to the extent that it purports to secure the payment

or after [June 22, 2010], shall be void and shall not be binding on or
enforceable against the subject real property or any subsequent owner,
purchaser, or mortgagee of any interest in the real property.  This subsection
shall not imply that any particular deed restriction, covenant running with the
land, or lien that is created or filed prior to [June 22, 2010], is valid per
se.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  No person shall be entitled to recover
from the recipient or payee any fee, charge, or assessment required by a deed
restriction or other covenant running with the land in connection with the
transfer of real property to the extent that the fee, charge, or assessment was
paid prior to [June 22, 2010].</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Filed&quot; means filed in the office of
the assistant registrar of the land court.</p>
