<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Shall cooperate with federal agencies, other
state agencies, county or other local governmental organizations, and all other
public and private agencies created for the purpose of utilizing and conserving
the waters of the State, and assist these organizations and agencies in
coordinating the use of their facilities and participate in the exchange of
ideas, knowledge, and data with these organizations and agencies.  For this
purpose the commission shall maintain an advisory staff of experts;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Shall prepare, publish, and issue printed
pamphlets and bulletins as the commission deems necessary for the dissemination
of information to the public concerning its activities;</p>

public;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (12)  Shall provide coordination, cooperation, or
approval necessary to the effectuation of any plan or project of the federal
government in connection with or concerning the waters of the State.  The
commission shall approve or disapprove any federal plans or projects on behalf
of the State.  No other agency or department of the State shall assume the
duties delegated to the commission under this paragraph; except that the
department of health shall continue to exercise the powers vested in it with
respect to water quality, and except that the department of business, economic
development, and tourism shall continue to carry out its duties and responsibilities
under chapter 205A;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (13)  Shall plan and coordinate programs for the
development, conservation, protection, control, and regulation of water
resources, based upon the best available information, and in cooperation with

am L 2002, c 35, §1; am L 2006, c 300, §7]</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insofar as the commission on water resource management, as
the agency authorized to administer the state water code, determines the
contents of the Hawaii water plan, which includes the designation of hydrologic
units and sustainable yields, and the commission's &quot;interpretation of its
own rules is entitled to deference unless it is plainly erroneous or
inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose&quot;, it is within the
commission's authority to limit reservations of water to specific aquifers.
