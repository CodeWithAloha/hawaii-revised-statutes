<p class=XNotes>  County of Hawai`i department of finance was an

direct appeal to the intermediate appellate court (ICA) under §91-14(b) and
§269-15.5 only applied to contested cases, appellant power company was not
entitled to appeal the dismissal order directly to the ICA; thus, the ICA
lacked jurisdiction over appellant's appeal.  126 H. 242 (App.), 269 P.3d 777.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Contested case.</b></p>

&quot;contested case&quot;.  69 H. 81, 734 P.2d 161.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Because the subject matter of the underlying hearing did not
involve the homestead lessees' property interests, the Hawaiian homes

under this chapter.  93 H. 298 (App.), 1 P.3d 768.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes><b>Rules.</b></p>

<p class=XNotes>  Generally.  55 H. 538, 524 P.2d 84.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Water resource management commission's distinctive treatment
of &quot;nonagricultural uses&quot;, such as golf course irrigation, in its
water use permit and policy decision did not constitute &quot;illegal
rulemaking&quot; where commission did not propose any general rules
automatically applicable in all circumstances, but instead devised a principled
solution to a specific dispute based on &quot;facts applied to rules that have
already been promulgated by the legislature&quot;.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Planning and permitting department's policy of refusing to
publicly disclose developer's engineering reports prior to their approval
constituted a &quot;rule&quot;; as this policy was not &quot;published or made
available for public inspection&quot; nor did plaintiff have actual knowledge
of the policy prior to its initial request for the reports, department did not
comply with this chapter and was proscribed from invoking this policy; thus,
department violated this chapter by refusing to publicly disclose any
unaccepted engineering reports and written comments, and all of its files,
including developer's file, were public records that could be examined upon
request.  119 H. 90, 194 P.3d 531.</p>

procedures are not &quot;rules&quot; subject to Hawaii administrative procedure
act's rulemaking requirements.  9 H. App. 406, 844 P.2d 679.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where Kauai police department's general order establishing
authority and procedures at sobriety checkpoints concerned only the internal
management of an agency and did not affect the private rights of or procedures
available to the public, the general order was not required to be promulgated
pursuant to this chapter.  111 H. 59 (App.), 137 P.3d 373.</p>
