department of education under the same pay schedule;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Faculty of the University of Hawaii and the

<p class=1Paragraph>    (14)  State law enforcement officers and state and
county ocean safety and water safety officers.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  Because of the nature of work involved and
the essentiality of certain occupations that require specialized training,
supervisory employees who are eligible for inclusion in units (9) through (14)
shall be included in units (9) through (14), respectively, instead of unit (2)
or (4).</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The classification systems of each
jurisdiction shall be the bases for differentiating blue collar from white
collar employees, professional from institutional, health and correctional
workers, supervisory from nonsupervisory employees, teachers from educational
officers, and faculty from nonfaculty.  In differentiating supervisory from
nonsupervisory employees, class titles alone shall not be the basis for
determination.  The nature of the work, including whether a major portion of
the working time of a supervisory employee is spent as part of a crew or team
with nonsupervisory employees, shall be considered also.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  For the purpose of negotiating a

shall have three votes, the board of regents of the University of Hawaii shall
have two votes, and the president of the University of Hawaii shall have one
vote.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>Any decision to be reached by the applicable
employer group shall be on the basis of simple majority, except when a
bargaining unit includes county employees from more than one county.  In that
case, the simple majority shall include at least one county.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  In addition to a collective bargaining
agreement under subsection (d), each employer may negotiate, independently of
one another, supplemental agreements that apply to their respective employees;
provided that any supplemental agreement reached between the employer and the
exclusive representative shall not extend beyond the term of the applicable
collective bargaining agreement and shall not require ratification by employees
in the bargaining unit.</p>

charter school commission, or as a charter school authorizer established under
chapter 302D;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Top-level managerial and administrative
personnel, including the department head, deputy or assistant to a department
head, administrative officer, director, or chief of a state or county agency or
major division, and legal counsel;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Secretary to top-level managerial and
administrative personnel under paragraph (3);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  Individual concerned with confidential matters
affecting employee-employer relations;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  Part-time employee working less than twenty hours
per week, except part-time employees included in unit (5);</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  Temporary employee of three months' duration or
less;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  Employee of the executive office of the governor
or a household employee at Washington Place;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (9)  Employee of the executive office of the
lieutenant governor;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (10)  Employee of the executive office of the mayor;</p>
