<p class=RegularParagraphs align=center style='text-align:center'><b>PART IX.  ELECTRIC
RELIABILITY</b></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §269-141  Definitions.</b>  As used in this
part:</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Advanced grid modernization
technology&quot; means equipment, facilities, and associated processes that
individually or collectively function to improve the reliability, resiliency,
flexibility, and efficiency of the Hawaii electric system.  Advanced grid
modernization technology provides functional characteristics that improve the
operational capability of the Hawaii electric system, including but not limited
to automatic restoration of electrical service in response to power disturbance
events, greater enabling of participation in utility customer programs,
resilient operation against both physical and cyber-based attacks, the ability
to satisfy power quality requirements of new technologies and end users,
accommodation of energy generation and storage choices, enabling of innovative
products and services in electricity markets, improving customer energy-efficiency
practices encouraged by the availability of timely energy use information, and
optimization of assets and improving the operational efficiency of the Hawaii
electric system.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Ancillary services&quot; means those
essential grid support services provided by a facility, or other equipment to
support and ensure the reliable generation, transmission, and distribution of
electricity, including frequency response and regulation, inertial response,
reactive power and voltage control, and operating reserves.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Commission&quot; means the public
utilities commission.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Electric element&quot; means any plant,
line, cable, facility, control system, equipment, or other technology used for
the generation, transmission, distribution, storage, regulation, or physical
control of electricity.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Hawaii electric system&quot; means all
electric elements located within the State together with all interconnections
located within the State that collectively provide for the generation,
transmission, distribution, storage, regulation, or physical control of
electricity over a geographic area; provided that this term shall not include
any electric element operating without any interconnection to any other
electric element located within the State.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Interconnection&quot; means the physical
contact point connecting an electric element to another electric element or
group of electric elements that allows for the flow and transfer of electricity
between electric elements.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Interconnection requirement&quot; means a
standard or rule, adopted by the commission under this part, concerning the
performance levels, processes, practices, equipment, or facilities of any
entity either having or seeking to obtain an  interconnection to the Hawaii
electric system under procedures established pursuant to section 269-145 to
ensure the reliable operation of the Hawaii electric system.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;Reliability standard&quot; means an
electric reliability requirement or requirements, adopted by the commission
under this part, to ensure the reliable design and operation of any or all
portions of the Hawaii electric system, including but not limited to ancillary
service requirements.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     &quot;User, owner, or operator of the Hawaii
electric system&quot; means any person, business, organization, or other entity
who:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Owns, controls, operates, or manages plants or
facilities for the generation, transmission, or furnishing of electricity; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Provides, sells, or transmits all of that electricity,
except such electricity as is used in its own internal operations or is used
for its own consumption, directly to a public utility for either transmission
or distribution to the public;</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>provided that a user, owner, or operator of the
Hawaii electric system shall not be considered a public utility for the
purposes of this chapter. [L 2012, c 166, pt of §2; am L 2013, c 34, §3]</p>
