bulletins, or advisories, or conduct training as the board deems necessary for
the dissemination of information to the public;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (12)  Appoint and remove agents and employees,

attached to the application approval or certificate of approval to impound;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (17)  Issue orders requiring the adoption by an owner
of remedial measures necessary for the safety of life or public or private
property, or for carrying out this chapter or rules issued under this chapter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (18)  Order the immediate cessation of any act that is
started or continued without an application approval or certificate of approval
to impound as required by this chapter;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (19)  Enter private property and immediately take
actions necessary to provide protection to life or property at the owner's
expense, including removal of the dam or reservoir.  The entry shall not

damages resulting from wilful acts or gross negligence by the board or its
agents;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>    (20)  Recover from the owner, in the name of the State,
