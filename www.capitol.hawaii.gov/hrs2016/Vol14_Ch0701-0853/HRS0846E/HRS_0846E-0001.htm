<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Applicability of 2011 amendment.  L 2011, c 125, §4.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The L 2013, c 64, §3 amendment applies to any acts committed

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Indecent exposure, in violation of §707-734, does not
constitute an offense that entails &quot;criminal sexual conduct&quot; and,
consequently, persons convicted of indecent exposure are not &quot;sex offenders&quot;
for purposes of this chapter; thus, defendant was not required to register as a
&quot;sex offender&quot; pursuant to this chapter.  102 H. 383, 76 P.3d 935
(2003).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under article I, §5, of the Hawaii constitution, due process
requires that a convicted sex offender under this section be afforded the right
to a judicial hearing at which evidence may be offered to demonstrate that
continuance of all or part of the lifetime registration requirements are not
necessary in a particular case to fulfill the public need to which the sex
offender act responded.  105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Defendant argued that §707-756 was void for vagueness because
&quot;it refers to a confusing labyrinth of language in [this section] that
results in guesswork and differences in opinion&quot;.  There was no
constitutionally-infirm vagueness in the &quot;comparable to&quot; language of
the catchall provisions in the definitions of &quot;crime against minors&quot;
and &quot;sexual offense&quot; (2012); however, the language regarding a
criminal offense that &quot;exceeds&quot; one of the specifically-described
offenses was unconstitutionally vague.  Because defendant's behavior fell under
a &quot;clearly proscribed&quot; &quot;covered offense&quot;, the
&quot;exceeds&quot; language in this section was unnecessary to sustain a conviction
against defendant and defendant could not complain of the vagueness of the law
as applied to defendant.  The second part of the catchall provisions contained
some redundancy in the application to §707-756(1), but the criminal prohibition
was clear.  131 H. 312 (App.), 318 P.3d 602 (2013).</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where it was not necessary for defendant to actually commit
one of the felony offenses defined in this section in order to violate the
prohibition against the electronic enticement of a child under §707-756(1) but
only necessary under §707-756(1)(b)(iii) that defendant act with the intent to
promote or facilitate the commission of a felony offense defined in this
section, the State was not required to specify in the indictment which felony
offense defined in this section that defendant intended to promote or
facilitate.  120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3 (2009).</p>
