punctuation changed pursuant to §23G-15.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §708-857</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section is concerned with the passage of worthless
negotiable instruments where the actor has knowledge that the instrument will
not be honored.  Originally, bad check legislation was necessitated by the
common-law limitations on promissory fraud: misrepresentation of a future fact
was not sufficient to establish theft by deception.  Such artificial
distinctions are largely obviated by the definition of &quot;deception&quot;
used in the Code's theft provisions.[1]  As noted in the comments to the
Proposed Michigan Code,</p>

<p class=XNotes style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>     the elimination
of the promissory fraud doctrine thus eliminates the need for a bad check
statute in its traditional form.  This might suggest that there is no point
served in continuing a bad check statute in the Draft.  In answer, the statute
can serve a useful purpose when the merchant or bank that is in fact defrauded
does not wish to prosecute but the bank on which the bad check is drawn
does.[2]</p>

<p class=XNotes>This section, moreover, protects the prevailing system of
negotiable paper in addition to those individuals involved in a given case. 
Since emphasis in &quot;bad check&quot; cases ought to be placed upon the
theft, rather than on the bad check itself, the sanction provided for this
offense is relatively mild, i.e., a misdemeanor, and the grade of the offense
does not, as in the case of theft offenses, vary according to the amount
involved.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  The incorporation of the Uniform Commercial Code's
definitions of &quot;issue,&quot; &quot;negotiable instrument,&quot; and &quot;negotiation&quot;
in subsection (3), is intended to insure that in this area, where protection of
commercial transactions are reinforced with criminal sanctions, the civil and
penal law are closely correlated.  The use of the U.C.C.'s definition of &quot;negotiation&quot;
insures that the indorser with knowledge or expectation of ultimate nonpayment,
as well as the drawer, with such knowledge or expectation, will be covered.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Under the evidentiary rules established in subsection (2),
the prosecution fulfills its initial burden of proving intent by demonstrating,
beyond a reasonable doubt, either that the issuer had no account with the
drawee, or that such an instrument was not made good within ten days of receipt
of notice of dishonor.  Again, the definitions of the Uniform Commercial Code
are used for both convenience and uniformity.  Note, however, the modifications
toward leniency necessitated in adapting a civil statute to criminal use: 
actual, rather than constructive, receipt of notice of dishonor is required
before the time in which the actor must make good begins to run.  The time
period required by subsection (2)(b) does not prevent prosecution before the
time has elapsed, but only denies to the prosecution the benefit of that
particular evidentiary provision before the stated time has elapsed.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law defined this offense similarly, except
that Hawaii law required an intent to defraud.[3]  The Code provides that
knowledge of insufficient funds is adequate culpability for the imposition of
this penalty.  Moreover, distinguishing such knowledge from an intent to
defraud introduces conceptual niceties of questionable value.  Hawaii law also
recognized both the prima facie evidence of the requisite culpability based
upon insufficient funds and failure to correct the insufficiency within five
days.[4]  The Code attempts to better correlate this offense, both in language
and substance, with the civil law relating to negotiable instruments.</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-857</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 33, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by updating
cross references to article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which was
repealed and replaced by Act 118, Session Laws 1991.  House Standing Committee
Report No. 513, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1068.</p>
