<p class=XNotesHeading>COMMENTARY ON §711-1111</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section is provided on the theory that in an era of
increasing use of electronic eavesdropping devices, criminal sanctions should
be used to protect an individual's right of privacy.  Wiretapping is contrary
to federal law, but it is right that state law should also be on record against
it.  Therefore, in addition to simple trespassory, nonmechanical eavesdropping,
covered in subsection (1)(a), §711-1111 forbids any sort of electronic or
mechanical eavesdropping or surveillance whether done through some physical
connection with the place under surveillance or not.  Thus subsection (1)(b)
forbids installation or use of eavesdropping equipment in a &quot;private place&quot;
(defined in §711-1100) whereas subsection (1)(c) forbids the use anywhere of
equipment designed to receive sounds originating in a private place and
normally inaudible or incomprehensible outside.  Physical contact with the
private place is not necessary.  Subsection (1)(d) generally forbids
wiretapping, but does not apply to listening in on a party line or extension
phone (these are risks known to all telephone users and are not of the
magnitude of a wiretap), nor does it apply to interception by the telephone
company or a subscriber seeking to ascertain that the telephone is not being
put to improper use.  Thus a company with a telephone switchboard would not be
guilty of a crime if it ordered an employee to monitor calls in order to assure
that instructions limiting use of the telephone to business calls were being
followed.  Subsection (1)(e) forbids anyone to divulge the existence or
contents of a telephone call, telegram, or letter, which he knows was
unlawfully intercepted, or which he learned of in the course of his employment
by a transmitting agency, without the consent of the sender or the receiver. 
Since subsection (1)(d) has the exceptions noted, subsection (1)(e) would not
cover the party line eavesdropper who reveals what he has overheard.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Previous Hawaii law in this area was limited to violations of
privacy resulting from interception or recordation of telephone and wire
communications.[1]  The Code, therefore, is broader in its overall scope than
prior law.  However, as applied to telephone and wire interceptions or
recordations, the Code would limit criminal liability to situations where the
conduct was engaged in without the consent of both parties (sender and
receiver) to the conversation or communication.  If one of the parties to the
communication authorizes its interception or recordation (e.g., in an attempt
to trace obscene or extortionary telephone calls), criminal sanctions ought not
to result.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §711-1111</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 278, Session Laws 1999, amended this section, more
specifically, by making the offense of violation of privacy in the second
degree a misdemeanor.  The offense does not include the installation of any
device for, among other things, videotaping or filming another person in a
state of undress or sexual activity, which is covered under §711-1110.9.  The
knowing possession of materials created under circumstances prohibited in
§711-1110.9 is included as an offense under this section.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section to update the
crime of violation of privacy in the second degree to punish &quot;video
voyeurism&quot; in public places.  The legislature found that through
technological advancements, recording and broadcasting devices are easily
concealed.  Incidents of &quot;video voyeurism&quot; in public places have
occurred but are not chargeable under existing laws.   Changing the offense of
violation of privacy would address the growing concern for the offensive
practice of &quot;upskirt photography.&quot;  Senate Standing Committee Report
No. 637, House Standing Committee Report No. 1316.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 83, Session Laws 2004, amended this section to include
photographic images among the types of private communications that may not be
intercepted or divulged without the consent of the sender or receiver, except
when the images are disseminated, distributed, or transferred by electronic
communication service providers or remote storage services in the ordinary
course of business.  Act 83 also defined the terms &quot;electronic
communication,&quot; &quot;electronic communication service,&quot; &quot;electronic
communication service provider,&quot; &quot;electronic communication system,&quot;
and &quot;remote storage service.&quot;  Act 83 made statutory amendments to
the existing privacy law in order to prohibit the inappropriate use of new
digital technologies, such as cellular phones, that are capable of taking
digital photographs and transmitting those images.  House Standing Committee
Report No. 826-04, Conference Committee Report No. 43-04.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) to add
peering or peeping into windows and trespassing on property for sexual
gratification to the offense of violation of privacy in the second degree. 
House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Act 59, Session Laws 2012, amended this section to exclude
the surveillance of another in a stage of undress or sexual activity as such
acts are covered by violation of privacy in the first degree.  The legislature
found that existing law regarding a violation of privacy in the second degree,
a misdemeanor, as it pertains to a person in a stage of undress or sexual
activity was also covered by the felony offense of violation of privacy in the
first degree.  According to testimony submitted, case law required that a
violator be charged under the lesser charge in order to avoid constitutional
due process and equal protection issues.  Act 59 would resolve that conflict by
excluding the behavior from the lesser second degree offense, thereby allowing
violators to be charged under the felony offense.  House Standing Committee
Report No. 664-12, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3199.</p>
