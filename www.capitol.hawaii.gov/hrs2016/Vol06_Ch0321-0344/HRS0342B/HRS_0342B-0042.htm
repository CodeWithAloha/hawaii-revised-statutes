<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §342B-42  Enforcement.</b>  (a)  If the
director determines that any person has violated or is violating this chapter,
any rule adopted pursuant to this chapter, or any permit issued or variance
granted pursuant to this chapter, the director shall serve written notice by
certified mail or personal service upon the alleged violator or violators
specifying the alleged violation and may include with the notice:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  An order specifying a reasonable time during
which that person shall be required to take such measures as may be necessary
to correct the violation and to give periodic progress reports;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  An order imposing penalties provided in section
342B-48; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  An order that the alleged violator or violators
appear before the director for a hearing at a time and place specified in the
notice or to be set later and answer the charges complained of.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If the director determines that any person
is continuing to violate this chapter, any rule adopted, permit issued, or
variance granted pursuant to this chapter after having been served notice of
violation, the director shall serve written notice by certified mail or
personal delivery upon the alleged violator or violators specifying the alleged
violation.  With the notice the director:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Shall order the alleged violator or violators to
submit a written schedule within thirty days specifying the measures to be
taken and the time within which the measures shall be taken to bring that
person into compliance with this chapter, any rule adopted, permit issued, or
variance granted pursuant to this chapter.  The director shall accept or modify
the submitted schedule within thirty days of receipt of the schedule.  Any
schedule not acted upon after thirty days of receipt by the director shall be
deemed accepted by the director;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Shall order the alleged violator or violators to
cease and desist from the activities that violate this chapter, any rule
adopted, permit issued, or variance granted pursuant to this chapter, if that
person does not submit a written schedule to the director within thirty days. 
This order shall remain in effect until the director accepts the written
schedule;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  May impose penalties as provided in section
342B-48; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  May order the alleged violator or violators to
appear before the director for a hearing at a time and place specified in the
notice or to be set later and answer the charges complained of.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  If the director determines that any person
has violated an accepted schedule or an order issued pursuant to this section,
the director shall impose penalties by sending a notice<b> </b>in<b> </b>writing,
either by certified mail or by personal service, to that person, describing
such nonadherence or violation with<b> </b>reasonable particularity.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  Any order issued pursuant to this chapter
shall become final, unless not later than twenty days after the notice of
violation and order is served, the person or persons named therein request in
writing a hearing before the director.  Any penalty imposed pursuant to this
chapter shall become due and payable twenty days after the notice of penalty is
served, unless the person or persons named therein request in writing a hearing
before the director.  Whenever a hearing is requested on any penalty imposed
pursuant to this chapter, the penalty shall become due and payable only upon
completion of all review proceedings and the issuance of a final order
confirming the penalty in whole or in part.  Upon request for a hearing, the
director shall require that the alleged violator or violators appear before the
director for a hearing at the time and place specified in the notice and answer
the charges complained of.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Any hearing conducted pursuant to this
section shall be conducted as a contested case under chapter 91.  If, after a
hearing held pursuant to this section, the director finds that a violation or
violations have occurred, the director shall affirm or modify any penalties
imposed or shall modify or affirm the order previously issued or issue an
appropriate order or orders for the prevention, abatement, or control of the
violation or emission of air pollutants involved, or for the taking of such
other corrective action as may be appropriate.  If, after a hearing on an order
or penalty contained in a notice, the director finds that no violation has occurred
or is occurring, the director shall rescind the order or penalty.  Any order
issued after a hearing may prescribe timetables for necessary action in
preventing, abating, or controlling the violation.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  If the amount of any penalty is not paid
to the department within thirty days after it becomes due and payable, the
director may institute a civil action in the name of the State to collect the
administrative penalty which shall be a government realization.  In any
proceeding to collect the administrative penalty imposed, the director need
only show that:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Notice was given;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A hearing was held or the time granted for
requesting a hearing has run without such a request;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  The administrative penalty was imposed; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  The penalty remains unpaid.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  In connection with any hearing held
pursuant to this section, the director shall have the power to subpoena the
attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence on behalf of all
parties.<b> </b>[L 1992, c 240, pt of §1; am L 1993, c 208, §7; am L 1995, c
