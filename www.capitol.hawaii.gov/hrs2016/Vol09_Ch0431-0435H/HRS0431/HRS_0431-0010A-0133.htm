provided under this section shall be subject to a maximum benefit of $25,000
per year for services for children ages thirteen and under.  This section shall
not be construed as limiting benefits that are otherwise available to an
individual under an accident and health or sickness insurance policy.  Payments
made by an insurer on behalf of a covered individual for any care, treatment,
intervention, or service other than applied behavioral analysis shall not be
applied toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  Coverage under this section may be subject

of Mental Disorders, that individual may be required to undergo repeat
evaluation to remain eligible for coverage under this section.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (l)  Treatment for autism shall not be covered
pursuant to this section unless provided by an autism service provider that is
licensed by a state licensure board.  If a state licensure board that licenses
providers to provide autism services is unavailable, the autism service
provider shall:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Be certified by the Behavior Analyst
Certification Board, Inc.; provided that certification by the Behavior Analyst
Certification Board, Inc., shall be valid for purposes of this subsection for
no more than one year; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Meet any existing credentialing requirements
