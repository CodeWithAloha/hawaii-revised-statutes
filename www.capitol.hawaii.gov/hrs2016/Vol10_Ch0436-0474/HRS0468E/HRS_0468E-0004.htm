<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>§468E-4  Persons and practices not affected.</b> 
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing or restricting:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  A physician or surgeon from engaging in the
practice of medicine in this State; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  A licensed hearing aid dealer from engaging in
the practices of fitting and selling hearing aids in this State; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (3)  Any person licensed in this State by any other
law from engaging in the profession or occupation for which the person is
licensed; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (4)  Any person employed by any federal government
agency as a speech pathologist or audiologist from performing that person's
duties as an employee of the agency if the person must qualify for employment
under government certification or under civil service regulations; provided
that this section is applicable only when the person is performing duties as a
federal employee.  However, such person, without obtaining a license under this
chapter, may consult with or disseminate the person's research findings and
other scientific information to speech pathologists and audiologists outside
the jurisdiction of the organization by which the person is employed.  Such
person may additionally elect to be subject to this chapter; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (5)  The activities and services of persons pursuing a
course of study leading to a degree in speech pathology at a college or
university, if such activities and services constitute a part of a supervised
course of study and such person is designated &quot;speech pathology intern&quot;,
&quot;speech pathology trainee&quot;, or by other such titles clearly
indicating the training status appropriate to the person's level of training;
or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (6)  The activities and services of a person pursuing
a course of study leading to a degree in audiology at a college or university,
if such activities and services constitute a part of a supervised course of
study and such person is designated &quot;audiology intern&quot;,
&quot;audiology trainee&quot;, or by any other such titles clearly indicating
the training status appropriate to the person's level of training; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (7)  The activities and services of a person
fulfilling the clinical experience requirements or the clinical fellowship year
leading to the ASHA certificate of clinical competence; or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (8)  The performance of speech pathology or audiology
services in this State by any person not a resident of this State who is not
licensed under this chapter, if such services are performed for no more than
five working days in any calendar year and in cooperation with a speech
pathologist or audiologist licensed under this chapter, and if such person
meets the qualifications and requirements for application for licensure
described in section 468E-5.  However, a person not a resident of this State
who is not licensed under this chapter, but who is licensed under the law of
another state which has established licensure requirements at least equivalent
to those established by section 468E-5, or who is the holder of the ASHA
certificate of clinical competence in speech pathology or audiology or its
equivalent, may offer speech pathology or audiology services in this State for
no more than thirty working days in any calendar year, if such services are
performed in cooperation with a speech pathologist or audiologist licensed
under this chapter. [L 1974, c 48, pt of §1; am L 1981, c 242, §4; gen ch 1985;
