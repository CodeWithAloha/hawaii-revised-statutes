education as specified in the rules of the board.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The board may conduct a random audit, pursuant
to rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91, of registrants applying for renewal of
a registration to determine whether the continuing education requirements of
this subsection have been met.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     The failure, neglect, or refusal of any
registered guard to pay the renewal fee or meet the continuing education
requirements shall constitute a forfeiture of the guard's registration.  A
forfeited registration may be restored upon written application within one year
from the date of forfeiture, payment of the required renewal fee plus penalty
fees, and meeting the continuing education requirements in effect at the time
of restoration. [L 2010, c 208, §1; am L 2014, c 94, §2]</p>
