<p class=RegularParagraphs>     <b>[§485A-408]  Termination of employment or
association of agent and investment adviser representative; transfer of
employment or association.</b>  (a)  If an agent registered under this chapter
terminates employment or association with a broker-dealer or issuer<b>;</b> or
if an investment adviser representative registered under this chapter
terminates employment or association with an investment adviser or federal
covered investment adviser<b>;</b> or if either registrant terminates
activities that require registration as an agent or investment adviser
representative, the broker-dealer, issuer, investment adviser, or federal
covered investment adviser shall promptly file a notice of termination with the
commissioner.  If the registrant learns that the broker-dealer, issuer, investment
adviser, or federal covered investment adviser has not filed the notice, the
registrant shall promptly notify the broker-dealer, issuer, investment adviser
or federal covered investment adviser, to do so.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  If an agent registered under this chapter
terminates employment or association with a broker-dealer registered under this
chapter and begins employment or association with another broker-dealer
registered under this chapter; or if an investment adviser representative
registered under this chapter terminates employment or association with an
investment adviser registered under this chapter or a federal covered
investment adviser that has filed a notice under section 485A-405 and begins
employment by or association with another investment adviser registered under
this chapter or a federal covered investment adviser that has filed a notice
under section 485A-405; then upon the filing by or on behalf of the registrant,
within thirty days after the termination, of an application for registration that
complies with the requirement of section 485A-406(a) and payment of the filing
fee required under section 485A-410, the registration of the agent or
investment adviser representative shall be:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  Immediately effective as of the date of the
completed filing, if the agent's Central Registration Depository record or
successor record or the investment adviser representative's Investment Adviser
Registration Depository record or successor record does not contain any new or
amended disciplinary actions or proceedings within the previous twelve months;
or</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  Temporarily effective as of the date of the
completed filing, if the agent's Central Registration Depository record or
successor record or the investment adviser representative's Investment Adviser
Registration Depository record or successor record contains any new or amended
disciplinary actions or proceedings within the preceding twelve months.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  The commissioner may withdraw a temporary
registration if there are or were grounds for discipline as specified in
section 485A-412 and the commissioner does so within thirty days after the
filing of the application.  If the commissioner does not withdraw the temporary
registration within the thirty-day period, registration becomes automatically
effective on the thirty-first day after filing.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The commissioner may prevent the
effectiveness of a transfer of an agent or investment adviser representative
under subsection (b)(1) or (2) based on the public interest and the protection
of investors.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  If the commissioner determines that a
registrant or applicant for registration is no longer in existence or has
ceased to act as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment
adviser representative, or is the subject of an adjudication of incapacity or
is subject to the control of a committee, conservator, or guardian, or cannot
reasonably be located, a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter may
require the registration be canceled or terminated or the application denied. 
The commissioner may reinstate a canceled or terminated registration, with or
without hearing, and may make the registration retroactive. [L 2006, c 229, pt
of §1]</p>
