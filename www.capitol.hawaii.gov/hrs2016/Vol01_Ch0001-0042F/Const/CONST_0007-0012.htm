entity, and, by a two-thirds vote of the members to which each house is
entitled and by separate legislative bill, may authorize the State to issue
special purpose revenue bonds for each single project or multi-project program
of each special purpose entity; provided that the issuance of such special
purpose revenue bonds is found to be in the public interest by the legislature;

interest by the governing body of the political subdivision.  No special
purpose revenue bonds shall be secured directly or indirectly by the general
credit of the issuer or by any revenues or taxes of the issuer other than
receipts derived from payments by a person or persons under contract or from
any security for such contract or contracts or special purpose revenue bonds
and no moneys other than such receipts shall be applied to the payment
thereof.  The governor shall provide the legislature in November of each year
with a report on the cumulative amount of all special purpose revenue bonds
authorized and issued, and such other information as may be necessary. [Am

<p class=XNotesHeading>Revision Note</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  This section is a blend of the amendments made by HB 748 and
SB 2876 (2014) and was reviewed and approved by the Attorney General.</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  It was not necessary for a public project to have been
constructed in order for the taxes involved in the financing of the public
project to qualify as &quot;user taxes&quot; as that term is defined in
paragraph (9); one per cent increase in transient accommodations tax earmarked
for financing expenses associated with convention center development and construction
qualified as a &quot;user tax&quot;.  78 H. 157, 890 P.2d 1197.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Financing agreements entered into in accordance with chapter
37D are not bonds as that term is used in this section and thus do not count
toward the debt ceiling of article VII, §13 of Hawaii constitution.  85 H. 1,
936 P.2d 637.</p>
