<p class=RegularParagraphs><b>     §221.  Water.</b>  (a)  When used in this
section:</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (1)  The term &quot;water license&quot; means any
license issued by the board of land and natural resources granting to any
person the right to the use of government-owned water; and</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>     (2)  The term &quot;surplus water&quot; means so much
of any government-owned water covered by a water license or so much of any
privately owned water as is in excess of the quantity required for the use of
the licensee or owner, respectively.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (b)  All water licenses issued after the
passage of this Act shall be deemed subject to the condition, whether or not
stipulated in the license, that the licensee shall, upon the demand of the
department, grant to it the right to use, free of all charge, any water which
the department deems necessary adequately to supply the livestock, aquaculture
operations, agriculture operations, or domestic needs of individuals upon any
tract.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (c)  In order adequately to supply livestock,
the aquaculture operations, the agriculture operations, or the domestic needs
of individuals upon any tract, the department is authorized (1) to use, free of
all charge, government-owned water not covered by any water license or covered
by a water license issued after the passage of this Act or covered by a water
license issued previous to the passage of this Act but containing a reservation
of such water for the benefit of the public, and (2) to contract with any
person for the right to use or to acquire, under eminent domain proceedings
similar, as near as may be, to the proceedings provided in respect to land by
sections 101-10 to 101-34, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the right to use any
privately owned surplus water or any government-owned surplus water covered by
a water license issued previous to the passage of this Act, but not containing a
reservation of such water for the benefit of the public.  Any such requirement
shall be held to be for a public use and purpose.  The department may institute
the eminent domain proceedings in its own name.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (d)  The department is authorized, for the additional
purpose of adequately irrigating any tract, to use, free of all charge,
government-owned surplus water tributary to the Waimea river upon the island of
Kauai, not covered by a water license or covered by a water license issued
after July 9, 1921.  Any water license issued after that date and covering any
such government-owned water shall be deemed subject to the condition, whether
or not stipulated therein, that the licensee shall, upon the demand of the
department, grant to it the right to use, free of all charge, any of the
surplus water tributary to the Waimea river upon the island of Kauai, which is
covered by the license and which the department deems necessary for the
additional purpose of adequately irrigating any tract.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Any funds which may be appropriated by Congress
as a grant-in-aid for the construction of an irrigation and water utilization
system on the island of Molokai designed to serve Hawaiian home lands, and
which are not required to be reimbursed to the federal government, shall be deemed
to be payment in advance by the department and lessees of the department of
charges to be made to them for the construction of such system and shall be
credited against such charges when made.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (e)  All rights conferred on the department by
this section to use, contract for, or acquire the use of water shall be deemed
to include the right to use, contract for, or acquire the use of any ditch or
pipeline constructed for the distribution and control of such water and
necessary to such use by the department.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (f)  Water systems in the exclusive control of
the department shall remain under its exclusive control; provided that the
department may negotiate an agreement to provide for the maintenance of the
water system and the billing and collection of user fees.  If any provision or
the application of that provision is inconsistent with provisions contained in
this section, this section shall control.</p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     Water systems include all real and personal
property together with all improvements to such systems acquired or constructed
by the department for the distribution and control of water for domestic or
agricultural use. [Am Aug.&nbsp;1, 1956, c 855, §§2, 3, 70 Stat 915; am L 1963,
c 207, §§2, 5(b); am Const Con 1978 and election Nov.&nbsp;7, 1978; am L 1981,
c 90, §10; am L 1984, c 36, §1; am L 1990, c 24, §1]</p>

<p class=XNotesHeading>Case Notes</p>

<p class=XNotes>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Although the Hawaii administrative rules denominate
aquifer-specific reservations of water to the department of Hawaiian home
lands, such a limitation for purposes of water resource management does not
divest the department of its right to protect its reservation interests from
interfering water uses in adjacent aquifers.  103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Insofar as the commission on water resource management, as
the agency authorized to administer the state water code, determines the
contents of the Hawaii water plan, which includes the designation of hydrologic
units and sustainable yields, and the commission's &quot;interpretation of its
own rules is entitled to deference unless it is plainly erroneous or
inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose&quot;, it is within the
commission's authority to limit reservations of water to specific aquifers. 
103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where commission on water resource management failed to render
the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to whether
applicant had satisfied its burden as mandated by the state water code, it
violated its public trust duty to protect the department of Hawaiian home
lands' reservation rights under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the state
water code, the state constitution, and the public trust doctrine in balancing
the various competing interests in the state water resources trust.  103 H.
401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>

<p class=XNotes>  Where commission on water resource management's findings
supporting its conclusion that the proposed use of water would not interfere
with department of Hawaiian home lands' reservation rights under this section
failed to address whether the proposed user had adduced sufficient evidence
with respect to the impact of the proposed use on the department's reservation
in the adjacent aquifer system, commission erred in concluding that proposed
user had met its burden under §174C-49 to obtain a water use permit.  103 H.
401, 83 P.3d 664.</p>
