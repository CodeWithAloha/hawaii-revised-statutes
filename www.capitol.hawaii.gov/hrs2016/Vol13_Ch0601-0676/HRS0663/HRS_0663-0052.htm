<p class=RegularParagraphs><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     [§663-52] 
Conclusive presumptions relating to duty of public entities to warn of dangers
on improved public lands.</span></b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>  (a) 
A sign or signs warning of dangerous natural conditions on improved public
lands shall be conclusively presumed to be legally adequate warning of the
dangerous natural conditions of which the sign or signs warn, if the State or a
county posts a sign or signs warning of the dangerous natural conditions and
the design and placement of the warning sign or signs are approved by the
board.  The board shall consult the risk assessment working group established
by chapter 171, prior to approving the design and placement of a warning sign
pursuant to this section.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (b)  The
State or a county may submit to the board a comprehensive plan for warning of
dangerous natural conditions at a particular area of improved public lands. 
The board shall review the plan for adequacy of the warning as well as the
design and placement of the warning signs, devices, or systems.  The board
shall consult with the risk assessment working group before approving the
plan.  The risk assessment working group shall seek public comment on the
plan.  In the event that the board after consulting with the risk assessment
working group approves the plan for a particular area of improved public lands,
and the State or a county posts the warnings provided for in the approved plan,
then the warning signs, devices, or systems shall be conclusively presumed to
be legally adequate warning of all dangerous natural conditions on the improved
public lands.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (c)  The
State or a county shall have no duty to warn of dangerous natural conditions on
unimproved public lands.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (d)  If a
warning sign, device, or system is posted or established in accordance with
this section on unimproved lands, the posting or establishment of the warning
sign, device, or system shall not create a duty on the part of the State or
county to warn of other dangerous natural conditions on unimproved lands or to
place or establish an additional warning sign, device, or system in other
locations on the unimproved lands.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (e)  The
State and the counties shall implement and maintain a sign inspection program
in which a park caretaker or other authorized person conducts documented
inspections of all signs in the park or trail area on a quarterly or more
frequent basis.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     Records
shall be kept under the sign inspection program which document the date of each
sign inspection and whether the particular sign inspected was in place, free of
vandalism, and legible.  The State and the counties shall annually provide the
board with a copy of the documentation of all sign inspections under the sign
inspection program.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     The
conclusive presumption provided by this section shall continue for any sign
posted pursuant to this section for a period of one hundred twenty days after
the last inspection that documented that the sign was in place and legible,
after which the presumption shall lapse until the time at which the sign is
subsequently inspected and documented to be in place and in legible condition.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     In any
circumstance in which the conclusive presumption lapses because of the lack of
a documented inspection, the presumption shall be reestablished if the State or
county, as the case may be, proves by a preponderance of the evidence that at
the time of the incident at issue, the sign was in place and in legible
condition.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>     (f)  The
board shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 establishing standards to guide
the department of land and natural resources and the risk assessment working group
in the general design and placement of warning signs; provided that chapter 91
shall not apply to any other process or action undertaken pursuant to this
part.</span></p>

<p class=RegularParagraphs>     (g)  The State and the counties shall implement
an accident reporting and recordkeeping program whereby all known accidents in
park and trail areas are documented on an accident report form, and all such
accident reports are kept on a permanent basis.  The risk assessment working
group shall review and use accident reports kept as part of this program as
part of its consultation to the board under this section. [L 2003, c 82, pt of
